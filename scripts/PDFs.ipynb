      "Abstract\n",
      "Nowadays, smartphone is an indispensable part of people's daily life.\n",
      "Android System is the most popular system running on smartphone. Due\n",
      "to this popularity, malware detection on Android becomes on of the most\n",
      "signi\fcant task for research community. In this project, we are mainly\n",
      "focusing on one called MAMADROID System. Instead of previous work\n",
      "which highly relied on the permissions requested by apps, MAMADROID\n",
      "relied on the sequences of abstracted API calls performed by apps. We\n",
      "are very interested in this model and really want to explore deeper into\n",
      "it. To achieve this, we've been trying produce our own malware detection\n",
      "model based on the idea of MAMADROID. Basically what we've done is\n",
      "We made three basic model and take the one with the highest accuracy\n",
      "and made two more advanced model based on this model with the best\n",
      "performance.\n",
      "1 Introduction\n",
      "During 2019, 87% of the smartphone sales were running Android system. Due\n",
      "to this popularity, cyber-criminals have increasingly targeted this ecosystem, as\n",
      "malware running on mobile devices can be particularly lucrative. As a result, the\n",
      "research community has devoted signi\fcant attention to malware detection on\n",
      "Android system. Previous work has often relied on the permissions requested\n",
      "by apps, using models built from malware samples. This strategy, however,\n",
      "is prone to false positives, since there are often legitimate reasons for benign\n",
      "apps to request permission classi\fed as dangerous. To overcome this obstacle,\n",
      "research community has developed a novel system for malware detection called\n",
      "MAMADROID System [1]. Instead of relying on the permissions requested\n",
      "by apps, MAMADROID System relies on the sequences of abstracted API calls\n",
      "performed by an app rather than their use or frequency, using Markov Chains\n",
      "to model the behavior of the apps through the sequences of API calls. By doing\n",
      "research on this novel system, we are very interested in this model and really\n",
      "want to explore deeper into it. Therefore, our research question is: Create a\n",
      "malware detection model based on the idea of MAMADROID .\n",
      "12 Data Generating Process\n",
      "2.1 Source of Data\n",
      "Our raw apps data are collected from course DSMPL. We randomly collected\n",
      "77 apps contain malware and 143 benign apps, 220 apps data in total. Then\n",
      "we divided them into 147 apps for training and 73 apps for testing. Since the\n",
      "raw data have been classi\fed into di\u000berent categories, we are 100% percent sure\n",
      "that those benign apps don't contain any malware.\n",
      "2.2 Data Description\n",
      "The original form of our data was Android Application Package (APK) which\n",
      "could be unpacked by Apktools. We unpacked those packages to get the Smali\n",
      "\files speci\fcally for malware detection. Smali \fle is a type of \fle convert from\n",
      "the original Java code of an app. Based on previous works done by research\n",
      "community, malicious action of an app is always appeared in Smali \fles so that\n",
      "use Smali \fle for malware detection is signi\fcantly meaningful.An example of\n",
      "the structure of a Smali \fle and the API calls inside it is shown below:\n",
      "Figure 1: An example of Smali \fle\n",
      "In the \fgure above, we can observed that a Smali \fle contains 4 part of informa-\n",
      "tion: class information, statistic \felds, method and API calls. The method and\n",
      "API calls in a smali \fle is what we are going to analyze for building the model.\n",
      "The API calls we are using is extracted from Smali \fles for each application.\n",
      "2By dealing with API calls, we could be more aware of the characteristic of a\n",
      "malware so that we could better analyze a way for malware detection.\n",
      "2.3 Feature Extraction\n",
      "The original MAMADROID System used Markov Chains to model app be-\n",
      "havior, by evaluating transitions between calls. For each app, MAMADROID\n",
      "System takes as input the sequence of abstracted API calls (families/packages)\n",
      "of that app and builds a Markov chain where each package/family is a state and\n",
      "the transitions represent the probability of moving from one state to another.\n",
      "To improve this, we \frst try to take input as the method sequences of API calls\n",
      "instead of families/packages. Thus, the feature that we are going to use is the\n",
      "method sequences of API calls where each method and the API calls it con-\n",
      "tains represent states and the transitions represent the probability of a method\n",
      "moving to each API calls inside it. Here is an example of our feature:\n",
      "Figure 2: Feature example\n",
      "In the \fgure above, the blue box represent a method and contents in the grey\n",
      "box is API calls contain in this method. Our model used this feature to \ft into\n",
      "Markov Chains to evaluate the behavior of an app and then classi\fed it into\n",
      "either benign or malware.\n",
      "3 Model\n",
      "3.1 Model Description\n",
      "Using the features derived from data extracting process, based on the fact that\n",
      "the predictive task is generally classi\fcation problem, we have built 3 models\n",
      "in this project: Logistic Regression Model, Decision Tree Classi\fer, K-Nearest\n",
      "Neighbor-Classi\fer. Table 1 shows the test accuracy of our three models.\n",
      "Model Train Accuracy Test Accuracy\n",
      "Logistic 0.721 0.822\n",
      "DecisionTree 0.918 0.74\n",
      "KNN 0.925 0.918\n",
      "Table 1: Model Accuracy\n",
      "3K-Nearest-Neighbor Classi\fer, \"KNN\" in short, performed best among all\n",
      "three models.\n",
      "3.2 KNN Description\n",
      "In K-Nearest-Neighbor model, each data point is composed by a vector of six\n",
      "values: the number of Api-calls from android, androidx, java, javax, kotlin, self-\n",
      "de\fned families. Table 2 shows a sample observation from all feature vectors.\n",
      "Index android androidx java javax kotlin self\n",
      "1 5382 21 8367 0 0 4362\n",
      "Table 2: Sample observation\n",
      "KNN will store all training data points (vectors in that case) after training.\n",
      "During prediction process, KNN model will search through all data points in\n",
      "the training set to \fnd N-nearest data points of the input point and predict the\n",
      "result to be the majority of these neighbors. For instance, we set number of\n",
      "nearest neighbors to be 5 and get \fve data points. Two of them are malware\n",
      "and three of them are benign software. Then the model will predict it to be\n",
      "benign software since the majority of its neighbors is benignware.\n",
      "3.3 Model Optimization\n",
      "Since KNN model performed the best among all three, we choose this model and\n",
      "tried to optimize it. To improve this model, hyper-parameter tuning was did.\n",
      "We tried several di\u000berent values of K, from 1 to 20, to \fnd its best performance.\n",
      "The following \fgure 3 shows how test accuracy and train accuracy changed\n",
      "along with di\u000berent K.\n",
      "Based on \fgure 3, although K=1 has the highest train accuracy, it is not\n",
      "meaningful since K=1 means for each data point in the training set, the model\n",
      "is \fnding the data point itself, which will result in 100% accuracy. Therefore,\n",
      "when K=3, the model performs the best. Table 3 shows the top 3 test accuracy\n",
      "achieved by this model when K=1,3,5.\n",
      "K Train Accuracy Test Accuracy\n",
      "1 1 0.89\n",
      "3 0.925 0.918\n",
      "5 0.891 0.849\n",
      "Table 3: KNN Accuracy with di\u000berent K\n",
      "3.4 Advanced Model\n",
      "We then focus on the predicted results to discover ways to improve our current\n",
      "3-Nearest-Neighbor model. To research the predicted results in a more detailed\n",
      "4Figure 3: KNN\n",
      "way, we generate TP-TN-FP-FN matrix to reveal deeper information behind\n",
      "model performance. FP (A benignware predicted to be malware) and FN (A\n",
      "malware predicted to be benignware) are the most important categories since\n",
      "they shows mistakes made by the model. FN has more signi\fcant meaning since\n",
      "letting a malware pass detection would be a disaster. The following table shows\n",
      "the statistics.\n",
      "Positive Negative\n",
      "True 62 137\n",
      "False 6 15\n",
      "Table 4: TP-TN-FP-FN Matrix\n",
      "We classify all software according to TP-TN-FP-FN and draw \fgure 4, which\n",
      "is a bar chart showing average of numbers of api-call with respect to di\u000berent\n",
      "families.\n",
      "According to Figure 4, malware which were classi\fed to be benign software\n",
      "have fewer number of api-calls in general compared to TP malware. Also, FN\n",
      "malware have larger possibility of invoking self de\fned api-calls than java calls.\n",
      "FP benignware which were classi\fed to be have larger number of api-calls com-\n",
      "pared to TN benignware. In addition, malware rarely call apis from androidx\n",
      "and kotlin families. Based on information above, we built a new KNN model\n",
      "which \frst standardizes number of api-calls to fraction of total number of api-\n",
      "calls of speci\fc software and our new advanced model which contains a hybrid\n",
      "of KNN and our self-de\fned Decision Tree. It sets threshold for FN and FP\n",
      "malwares to cover edge cases. Our model performs the best when K=3. The\n",
      "hyper-parameter tuning of our advanced model is showed in Figure 5 below.\n",
      "5Figure 4: TP-TN-FP-FN\n",
      "Figure 5: Advanced Model\n",
      "4 Results\n",
      "Below are the results of our 3 di\u000berent KNN models.\n",
      "64.1 Model Comparison\n",
      "Model Train Accuracy Test Accuracy\n",
      "Advanced KNN 0.915 0.945\n",
      "Standardized KNN 0.823 0.877\n",
      "KNN 0.925 0.917\n",
      "Table 5: Accuracy\n",
      "The accuracy comparisons of these models has shown that our advanced\n",
      "model performed the best among all three models.\n",
      "4.2 Model Analysis\n",
      "The best model, Advanced KNN, is a hybrid of original KNN, standardized\n",
      "KNN and Decision Tree de\fned by us. It not only covers normal cases but also\n",
      "margin situations. On the contrary, the other two models, Standardized KNN\n",
      "make the input standardized to percentile before training and predicting, but\n",
      "it will lost information about number of api-call. Normal KNN only considers\n",
      "major cases and does not take margins into consideration.\n",
      "4.3 Data Findings\n",
      "According to our research results: 1.Malware tend to has more java api-calls\n",
      "than self-de\fned and android api-calls. 2.Malware with fewer api-calls is more\n",
      "likely to be classi\fed as benignware.\n",
      "4.4 Signi\fcance\n",
      "The result of this project has broad application in our daily life. If we can\n",
      "build a strong model to help Android users make accurate classi\fcation about\n",
      "whether a software is benign or harmful, it can protect information, privacy and\n",
