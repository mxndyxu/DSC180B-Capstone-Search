Abstract
Nowadays, smartphone is an indispensable part of people's daily life.
Android System is the most popular system running on smartphone. Due
to this popularity, malware detection on Android becomes on of the most
signicant task for research community. In this project, we are mainly
focusing on one called MAMADROID System. Instead of previous work
which highly relied on the permissions requested by apps, MAMADROID
relied on the sequences of abstracted API calls performed by apps. We
are very interested in this model and really want to explore deeper into
it. To achieve this, we've been trying produce our own malware detection
model based on the idea of MAMADROID. Basically what we've done is
We made three basic model and take the one with the highest accuracy
and made two more advanced model based on this model with the best
performance.
1 Introduction
During 2019, 87% of the smartphone sales were running Android system. Due
to this popularity, cyber-criminals have increasingly targeted this ecosystem, as
malware running on mobile devices can be particularly lucrative. As a result, the
research community has devoted signicant attention to malware detection on
Android system. Previous work has often relied on the permissions requested
by apps, using models built from malware samples. This strategy, however,
is prone to false positives, since there are often legitimate reasons for benign
apps to request permission classied as dangerous. To overcome this obstacle,
research community has developed a novel system for malware detection called
MAMADROID System [1]. Instead of relying on the permissions requested
by apps, MAMADROID System relies on the sequences of abstracted API calls
performed by an app rather than their use or frequency, using Markov Chains
to model the behavior of the apps through the sequences of API calls. By doing
research on this novel system, we are very interested in this model and really
want to explore deeper into it. Therefore, our research question is: Create a
malware detection model based on the idea of MAMADROID .
12 Data Generating Process
2.1 Source of Data
Our raw apps data are collected from course DSMPL. We randomly collected
77 apps contain malware and 143 benign apps, 220 apps data in total. Then
we divided them into 147 apps for training and 73 apps for testing. Since the
raw data have been classied into dierent categories, we are 100% percent sure
that those benign apps don't contain any malware.
2.2 Data Description
The original form of our data was Android Application Package (APK) which
could be unpacked by Apktools. We unpacked those packages to get the Smali
iles specically for malware detection. Smali le is a type of le convert from
the original Java code of an app. Based on previous works done by research
community, malicious action of an app is always appeared in Smali les so that
use Smali le for malware detection is signicantly meaningful.An example of
the structure of a Smali le and the API calls inside it is shown below:
Figure 1: An example of Smali le
In the gure above, we can observed that a Smali le contains 4 part of informa-
tion: class information, statistic elds, method and API calls. The method and
API calls in a smali le is what we are going to analyze for building the model.
The API calls we are using is extracted from Smali les for each application.
2By dealing with API calls, we could be more aware of the characteristic of a
malware so that we could better analyze a way for malware detection.
2.3 Feature Extraction
The original MAMADROID System used Markov Chains to model app be-
havior, by evaluating transitions between calls. For each app, MAMADROID
System takes as input the sequence of abstracted API calls (families/packages)
of that app and builds a Markov chain where each package/family is a state and
the transitions represent the probability of moving from one state to another.
To improve this, we rst try to take input as the method sequences of API calls
instead of families/packages. Thus, the feature that we are going to use is the
method sequences of API calls where each method and the API calls it con-
tains represent states and the transitions represent the probability of a method
moving to each API calls inside it. Here is an example of our feature:
Figure 2: Feature example
In the gure above, the blue box represent a method and contents in the grey
box is API calls contain in this method. Our model used this feature to t into
Markov Chains to evaluate the behavior of an app and then classied it into
either benign or malware.
3 Model
3.1 Model Description
Using the features derived from data extracting process, based on the fact that
the predictive task is generally classication problem, we have built 3 models
in this project: Logistic Regression Model, Decision Tree Classier, K-Nearest
Neighbor-Classier. Table 1 shows the test accuracy of our three models.
Model Train Accuracy Test Accuracy
Logistic 0.721 0.822
DecisionTree 0.918 0.74
KNN 0.925 0.918
Table 1: Model Accuracy
3K-Nearest-Neighbor Classier, ""KNN"" in short, performed best among all
three models.
3.2 KNN Description
In K-Nearest-Neighbor model, each data point is composed by a vector of six
values: the number of Api-calls from android, androidx, java, javax, kotlin, self-
dened families. Table 2 shows a sample observation from all feature vectors.
Index android androidx java javax kotlin self
1 5382 21 8367 0 0 4362
Table 2: Sample observation
KNN will store all training data points (vectors in that case) after training.
During prediction process, KNN model will search through all data points in
the training set to nd N-nearest data points of the input point and predict the
result to be the majority of these neighbors. For instance, we set number of
nearest neighbors to be 5 and get ve data points. Two of them are malware
and three of them are benign software. Then the model will predict it to be
benign software since the majority of its neighbors is benignware.
3.3 Model Optimization
Since KNN model performed the best among all three, we choose this model and
tried to optimize it. To improve this model, hyper-parameter tuning was did.
We tried several dierent values of K, from 1 to 20, to nd its best performance.
The following gure 3 shows how test accuracy and train accuracy changed
along with dierent K.
Based on gure 3, although K=1 has the highest train accuracy, it is not
meaningful since K=1 means for each data point in the training set, the model
is nding the data point itself, which will result in 100% accuracy. Therefore,
when K=3, the model performs the best. Table 3 shows the top 3 test accuracy
achieved by this model when K=1,3,5.
K Train Accuracy Test Accuracy
1 1 0.89
3 0.925 0.918
5 0.891 0.849
Table 3: KNN Accuracy with dierent K
3.4 Advanced Model
We then focus on the predicted results to discover ways to improve our current
3-Nearest-Neighbor model. To research the predicted results in a more detailed
4Figure 3: KNN
way, we generate TP-TN-FP-FN matrix to reveal deeper information behind
model performance. FP (A benignware predicted to be malware) and FN (A
malware predicted to be benignware) are the most important categories since
they shows mistakes made by the model. FN has more signicant meaning since
letting a malware pass detection would be a disaster. The following table shows
the statistics.
Positive Negative
True 62 137
False 6 15
Table 4: TP-TN-FP-FN Matrix
We classify all software according to TP-TN-FP-FN and draw gure 4, which
is a bar chart showing average of numbers of api-call with respect to dierent
families.
According to Figure 4, malware which were classied to be benign software
have fewer number of api-calls in general compared to TP malware. Also, FN
malware have larger possibility of invoking self dened api-calls than java calls.
FP benignware which were classied to be have larger number of api-calls com-
pared to TN benignware. In addition, malware rarely call apis from androidx
and kotlin families. Based on information above, we built a new KNN model
which rst standardizes number of api-calls to fraction of total number of api-
calls of specic software and our new advanced model which contains a hybrid
of KNN and our self-dened Decision Tree. It sets threshold for FN and FP
malwares to cover edge cases. Our model performs the best when K=3. The
hyper-parameter tuning of our advanced model is showed in Figure 5 below.
5Figure 4: TP-TN-FP-FN
Figure 5: Advanced Model
4 Results
Below are the results of our 3 dierent KNN models.
64.1 Model Comparison
Model Train Accuracy Test Accuracy
Advanced KNN 0.915 0.945
Standardized KNN 0.823 0.877
KNN 0.925 0.917
Table 5: Accuracy
The accuracy comparisons of these models has shown that our advanced
model performed the best among all three models.
4.2 Model Analysis
The best model, Advanced KNN, is a hybrid of original KNN, standardized
KNN and Decision Tree dened by us. It not only covers normal cases but also
margin situations. On the contrary, the other two models, Standardized KNN
make the input standardized to percentile before training and predicting, but
it will lost information about number of api-call. Normal KNN only considers
major cases and does not take margins into consideration.
4.3 Data Findings
According to our research results: 1.Malware tend to has more java api-calls
than self-dened and android api-calls. 2.Malware with fewer api-calls is more
likely to be classied as benignware.
4.4 Signicance
The result of this project has broad application in our daily life. If we can
build a strong model to help Android users make accurate classication about
whether a software is benign or harmful, it can protect information, privacy and
save a lot of money for users.

Exploring the Language of Malware
 
Abstract
 
 
The Android app store and its open-source features make it extremely vulnerable to
 
malicious software, known as Malware. The current state of the art encompasses the use of
 
advanced code analysis and corresponding machine learning models. Although along with our
 
initial research we found that the Applications in the Android app store along with their
 
corresponding API calls behave a lot like a language. They have their comparable own syntax,
 
structure, and grammar. This inspired us to use techniques from Natural Language
 
Processing(NLP) and use the same idea of creating graphical relationships between applications
 
and APIs. Additionally, we also show that the use of these graphical embeddings maintains the
 
integrity of classification metrics to even correctly identify and differentiate Malware and Benign
 
applications.
 
 
 
1. Introduction
 
 
By July 2020, Android OS is still a leading mobile operating system that holds 74.6% of
 
the market share worldwide, attracting numerous cyber-criminals who are targeting the largest
 crowd.¹ The current state of the art of Malware detection uses machine learning models built of
 
static syntactic relationships between the codebase and corresponding API calls.
 
 
A great baseline for models currently used is the HinDroid implementation
​
. As other
 
malware detection system simply use Application Programming Interface (API) calls, HinDroid
 
further analyzes the relationship between API calls and higher-level semantics which raise the
 
threshold for attackers.
​
3
​
 A prime example of using Heterogeneous Information Network for
 
Android Malware Detection.
​
3
 
Initial analysis and research from the Heterogeneous Networks made it more apparent
 
that the relationships between APIs and applications were closely modeled to languages. They
 
had their own syntax, structure, and semantics. Thus these relationships were further analyzed in
 
order to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to further form relationships and
 
classify Malware and Benign applications.
 
 
With the core idea to map out relationships using language models, this paper explores a
 
handful of vectorization and embedding techniques to accurately form information chains across
 
the data. In particular, we explore Word2vec, Node2vec, and Metapath2vec in-depth and discuss
 
other advanced implementations.
 
 
 
2. Data
 
2.1 Data Collection
 
Data Source
 
In order to accurately map relationships between API’s the applications from the Android Play
 
Store are reduced to a version of assembly code for Java-based applications called Dalvik
 
bytecode. The APK’s that contain the smali code are directly downloaded from
 
‘
​
https://apkpure.com/
​
’ and compiled into .smali files using the apktools library.
 
 
Data Extraction
 
Thus, this data is then unpackaged using the apktools library that allows us to view the
 
subsequent smali code (a code that humans can interpret) and app binaries. The smali code and
 
app binaries contain a lot of the information derived from the Java source code that allows us to
 
map the number of API calls and the relationships between them.
 
 
 Data Categories
 
 
We extracted the datasets of the source code of each app from our section resource,
 
which includes 
​
a total of 800 apps. The benign apps are picked randomly. For the malware apps,
 
we specifically picked malware apps that are type Anup and RuMMS.
 
 
 
RuMMS
​
 is a type of SMS Phishing malware that has gained popularity in recent years,
 
while some of the others were chosen randomly from a set of Malware types. The intention
 
behind this was to accurately identify through embeddings the presence of varied Malware
 
genres.
 
 
 
 
2.2 Exploring Data
 
 
 
The scale at which each application had API calls was approximate of the order of O(N
​
2
​
). Thus
 
across a large variety of applications, there were approximately 10 Million API Calls that needed
 
to be handled. To correctly evaluate the scale the APIs were analyzed at scale, some of these
 
findings resulted in resorting to Vectorization and API Reduction techniques.
 
 
 
The API call itself provides an array of information to be able to organize the relationships
 
between APIs and Applications in their respective matrices.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 API Calls
 
One of the major differences between malware and benign apps is the number of API
 
calls to the system. Not only are the number of API calls different, although the variety of API
 
calls in malware tend to be much higher.
 
 
Below we see the quantity distribution of the most popular common API across both
 
Malware and Benign Applications. The commonly used API calls in benign apps tend to be
 
similar. This further allows us to create better formulas for reducing and vectorizing API calls.
 
 
 
 
Constructing Adjacency Matrices
 
To help highlight APP → API relationships, we created 3 adjacency matrices.
 
 
Below are the three matrices and their contents.
 
  
 
Based on the matrices, we explored meta path AA
​

​

​

​
, APA
​

​
, and APBP
​

​
, and used
 
multi-kernel learning to compute the similarities.
 
 
Baseline Model
 
 
As a baseline model for all the subsequent research, we picked the HinDroid model. The
 
HinDroid model leverages the Adjacency Matrices and their subsequent meta paths, as outlined
 
above to be inputted into Support Vector Machines as custom kernels for the model.
 
 
It must be noted that the baseline model, here, is not a function of improving subsequent models
 
- rather a comparison to gauge metrics from various techniques used ahead.

3. Graph Embedding Techniques
 
Now that we’ve established base relationships across Apps and APIs through various adjacency
 
matrices and baseline models. To better understand the relationships between API calls, and their
 
subsequent properties we explore them through Graph Networks, their ability to learn and
 
traverse, and the corresponding vectorized embeddings.
 
 
 
3.1 Word2vec
 
 
Word2Vec is one of the most popular techniques to learn word embeddings using a
 
shallow neural network, developed by 
​
Tomas Mikolov in 2013 at Google
​
.  Word2vec learns the
 
association among words from a large corpus of text, and it could be used to find synonymous
 
words or suggest an additional word for an incomplete sentence using 
​
Skip Gram
​
 or 
​
Common
 
Bag Of Words (CBOW).
 
For this particular analysis, we constructed a graph traversal for the word to vector
 
embeddings using the APA relationship. An APA relationship is a meta-path:
 
App→(contains)API→(same package name)API→(contains
​
-1
​
)APP. After this, we can then use
 
the dot product to calculate the similarity. This allows us to analyze through embeddings the
 
relationships of malware and benign applications.
 
 
 
 
This relationship is expressed as embeddings which we then visualize on the
 
2-Dimensional plane to further use clustering techniques to classify the application types.
 
 
 
3.2 Node2vec
 Node2vec is an algorithmic framework for representational learning on graphs. Given
 
any graph, it can learn continuous feature representations for the nodes, which can then be used
 
for various downstream machine learning tasks.
 
Compared to the simple graph we have for Word2Vec, Node2vec can be applied to
 
complexly structured graphs that are "" (un)directed, (un)weighted, or (a)cyclic."" To accomplish
 
that, Node2vec generates biased random walks from each node of the graph. This provides a way
 
of balancing the exploration-exploitation tradeoff by smoothly interpolate between BFS and
 
DFS.
 
Using random walks through the corpus, we created multiple documents as an input into
 
the Gensim model for vectorizing embeddings using sentences. These embeddings were then
 
analyzed using their corresponding graph clusters.
 
 
The purpose of random walks is to add context to the Application → API nodes, by
 
looking at corresponding applications or APIs that are neighbors to the starting applications.
 
 
In the figure under node2vec above we clearly see the distinction between the two
 
classes. On visualizing this on a 2-Dimensional plane it is now possible to use lighter
 
classification models to help classify benign vs malware applications.
 
 
3.3 Metapath2vec
 
Comparing to Word2Vec and Node2Vec which use homogeneous graph networks,
 
Metapath2Vec uses heterogeneous graph networks. Heterogeneous graph networks allow us to
 
distinguish different types of nodes and edges(relationship). In our case, using heterogeneous
 
graph networks enable us to see the difference between API and APP nodes.
 
 
 
On the other hand, similar to Node2Vec, Metapath2Vec takes random walks to “construct
 
the heterogeneous neighborhood of a node” and then uses “a heterogeneous skip-gram model to
 
perform node embeddings.”
​
6
 
 
 
4. Vector Embedding Analysis and Exploration
  
To visualize the Embedding Techniques,
 
 
1.
we imported 
​
gensim.models
​
 to vectorize the apps
 
2.
Then we visualize the high-dimension vector using scipy.TSNE, (The graph showing in
 
the subsection below) allowed us to reduce the dimension of the vector embeddings to 2.
 
 
 
3.1 Word2vec:
 
 
 
 
 
3.2 Node2vec:
 
 
The graph above shows the distribution of each app from graph embedding. A dot represents an
 
app in the graph.
 Then we use the k-means clustering method to classify the apps from malware to benign apps.
 
The graph below shows the result when k = 2, k=3, and k=4. (see the pics below)
 
(k = 2)
     (k = 3)
 
(k = 4)
 
Here is the accurate plot differentiating malware from benign apps:
 
 
Comparing the plots, we can see that k-means clustering isn’t a good model to predict malware.
 
As all the k-means clustering separates clusters horizontally, we can assume that more than 50%
 
of APPs are misclassified. Misclassifying malware as a benign app could cause a huge loss, so
 
K-means clustering isn’t a good algorithm for detecting malware.
 Looking at the second graph, we see a distinct boundary between the application types. Further
 
analysis would look at different meta paths that could better identify this boundary in addition to
 
classifiers to elevate the creation of decision boundaries.
 
 
A similar observation can be made with the word2vec graph showing the difference between the
 
two classes, here even a linear relationship could be identified between the two classes.

Abstract
In today's world, malware has grown so much. In 2020, there are more than 129
millions of Android users around the world. With Android applications dominating
the devices, we hope to produce a detection tool that is accessible to the general
public. We present a structure that analyze apps in the form of control ow graph.
With that, we build a common graph to capture how close the apps are to each other
and classify whether they are malicious or not. We compare our work with other
methods and show that using control ow graph is a good choice as a representation
of Android applications (APKs) and can outperform other models. We built features
using Metapath2Vec and Doc2Vec, and trained Random Forest, 1-Nearest Neighbors,
and 3-Nearest Neighbors Models.
1 Introduction
There are many malware detection tools available in the market, including pattern-based,
behavior-based methods, etc, with the prompt development of articial intelligence, many
modern data analysis methods are applied to detecting malware in recent years. We are
interested in investigating the eectiveness of dierent data analysis methods for detecting
certain types of malware.
As the number of malicious software (malware) increases throughout the past few
decades, malware detection has become a challenge for app developers, companies hosting
the apps, and people using the apps. There are many pieces of research conducted on
malware detection since it rst appeared in the early 1970s. Just like the paper we studied
in our rst quarter, it uses the HIN (Heterogeneous Information Network) structure to
classify the Android applications. It also compared its own method against other popular
methods such as Naive Bayes and Decision Tree, and other known commercial mobile
security products, to test its performance. The result showed that their method performs
better than the other methods with an accuracy of 98% while other others only achieve
an average of 90%. After studying the paper, we are more curious about the detecting
eectiveness of an analysis method when applied to a certain type of malware.
1Figure 1: Project Pipeline
Not everyone has access to tools that can detect whether or not the app they just
downloaded is malicious or not. Our motivation to conduct this research is to hope to
produce a recommending tool that can be easily accessed by the general public for detecting
malware. Optimistically, we want to reduce the chance of people downloading malicious
apps and potentially prevent their devices from being hacked. To achieve that, we will be
classifying applications using Control Flow Graphs and dierent similarity-based methods
including k-nearest neighbors (kNN) as well as Random Forest classier to see if dierent
methods can detect certain types of malware or any specic features.
We are interested in analyzing whether one classier has better performance in de-
tecting certain types of malware or specic features, and designing a framework for rec-
ommending a method with a specic set of parameters for a certain type of malware
and provide users a more friendly interface. With the similarity-based approach, we be-
lieve that it will detect malware with much higher accuracy and will be more exible for
applications that evolved over time as they become more complicated.
2 Related Work
2.1 MamaDroid
MamaDroid [1] is a system that detects Android malware by the apps' behaviors. This
method extract call graphs from APKs, which are represented using nodes and edges in
a graph object. From each graph, sequences of probabilities are extracted, representing
one feature vector per APK. These probabilistic feature vectors are used for malware
classication. MamaDroid also abstracts each API call to the family and package level,
which inspired us to abstract to the class level. This is discussed further later.
2.2 Hindroid
Hindroid [2] is a system that parses SMALI code extracted from APKs and uses them
to create four dierent graphs, which are represented by large matrices. Within these
matrices, each value in a matrix corresponds to an edge. A combination of these matrices
are used to classify malicious software and benign apps.
2.3 Metapath2Vec
Metapath2Vec [3] is a node representation learning model that uses predened paths based
on the node types. These paths dene where the the program can traverse the graph.
Following is an example of a metapath. In this case below, the metapath is Type 1 →
Type 2→Type 1→Type 3→Type 1.
2Figure 2: Metapath2vec Example
With predened meta-paths, we can traverse a graph according to these node types
to generate a large corpus, which is then fed into Node2Vec to obtain representations of
words. This method will obtain one vector for one node within the graph.
2.4 Word2Vec
Word2vec [4] is a model that turns text into numerical representations. It is trained on a
large corpus, and outputs a representation for each word in the corpus. Below is a famous
example of Word2Vec: King and Queen and Men and Women.
Figure 3: Word2vec Example
Since Word2Vec measures the similarity between words using Cosine similarity, we can
see from the above vector space that the word King is similar to Queen, and Men is similar
to Women.
2.5 Doc2Vec
Similar to Word2Vec, Doc2Vec [5] turns a whole document/paragraph into numerical
representations instead of word representations. If we can obtain one corpus from each of
the apps by applying metapath2vec, then we can treat each corpus as its own document,
and then feed it into the Doc2Vec model to learn representations for each of the documents.
These vector representations can then be used in the classication process.
3 Data
The data we will be using is randomly downloaded from APK Pure and AMD malware
dataset. It consists of labeled malware and other popular and unpopular (random) appli-
cations. Among our random apps downloaded from APK Pure, there might be one app
out of ve that might be a malware since they are apps that have little or no reviews.
Rather than using .SMALI les, we will be working with APK les directly. From the
APK les, we will be extracting a new form of representation called Control Flow Graphs.
With APK les, we can easily generate control ow graphs through Androguard [6], which
is a powerful tool to disassemble and decompile Android applications.
3.1 Control Flow Graph
A Control Flow Graph (CFG) is a representation using graph notation of all paths that
might be traversed through a program during execution. Firstly, a CFG consists of nodes
3and edges. Control Flow is the order in which individual statements, instructions, or
function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated. Imperative meaning
statements that change a program's state. Each node in the CFG represents a basic block,
or a straight-line piece of code without any jumps or jump targets. In our case, a node
in the CFG is an API or method call. A jump statement is a statement that changes the
program's ow into another place of the source code. For example, from line 4 to line 60,
or from le 1 to le 6. The following gures 4 are two simple control ow graphs.
Figure 4: A Simple Control Flow Graph
A node in our CFG can call another API (node). A node can be visualized as one of
the circles in Figure 4, and the ""call"" action can be visualized by the arrow(edge). Each
node has attributes. There are 7 Boolean attributes for each node, and 3 dierent edge
types.
Node Attributes
External If a node is an external method
Entrypoint If a node is not called by anything
Native If a node is native
Public If the node is a public method
Static If the node is a static method
Node If none of the above are True
APK node If the node is an APK
Table 1: Node Attributes
We can pick from the 6 Boolean attributes and create node types based, such as:
\external, public Node"", \external, static Node"" and \entrypoint, native Node"". There
can be more than 20 dierent node types.
Edge Types
Calls API to API
Contains APK to API
In API to APK
Table 2: Edge Types
Together, nodes and edges can build paths like: \external, public Node - calls { >
external, static Node"" or \APK - contains { >external, public Node"". The following is a
control ow graph example with code block to explain how nodes are called:
Class: Lclass0/package0/exampleclass; ## let's call this A
# direct methods
.method public constructor <init>()V
if ....:
# api, call this B:
Lclass1/package1/example;->doSomething(Ljava/lang/String;)V
else:
# api, call this C:
Lclass2/package2/example;->perform(L1/2/3)F
4Figure 5: Control Flow Graph With Code Block Example
The method constructor calls API A, which calls API B: doSomething and calls
API C: perform . Since API B and API C will jump to other places within the source
code, the ow of the program is broken, and this jump is recorded in the control ow
graph.
The Control Flow Graph from an app records tens of thousands of these calls, and
represents them as edges, where each edge contains two nodes.
3.2 Common Graph
Since we obtained a large number of CFGs for a large number of APKs, we need to gure
out a way to connect all of these graphs so the representations for each API will be the
same. We want the API representations to be the same so when we are classifying we
know that all feature vectors are built the same way. This is to avoid us creating random
feature vectors, and will result in the model classifying randomly. To make sure we are
building features correctly, we must create a common graph that links every CFG together.
Also, during the testing phase, we can use these node embeddings to build a feature vector
for an unseen app. The common graph we built contains a total of 1,950,729 nodes, and
215,604,110 edges. Our common graph is simply a union of all the control ow graphs
that we obtained from separate apps. This is not only to make sure that each distinct
API node are consistent throughout our training and testing process, but to make sure
that all our CFGs are on the same space. First, all the edges of each separate graphs are
extracted, along with their weights and node types of each edge. Then, these information
are loaded altogether to become a common graph.
Figure 6: Common Graph Example
Figure 6 above demonstrates what a common graph looks like by combining two control
ow graphs from two dierent apps. On the left we have red and blue applications, which
both have ve nodes consisting of A, B, and C nodes connected together and other nodes
of its own. When combining them, we generate the graph on the right, which merge the
shared nodes with each other. Duplicate nodes are joined to be one, while the edges are
5still preserved. As you can see, the similar A, B, C sequence is preserved as well. This is
important when we are building feature vectors for an app. The common graph ensures the
same node representations for two graphs. This means that when we are building feature
vectors for apps, the same representations are used for two similar apps. Conversely, if
two apps are not similar and do not share the same sequences, then their representations
will be very dierent. Like in the common graph in Figure 6, this will make sure that the
similarity and dierences between the apps are preserved.
3.3 Data Generating Process and ETL
The raw data we are investigating is code written by app developers. In order to turn
something into a malware, you have to alter the source code, which will allow hackers
to plant certain types of malicious code. If a developer were to hijack a device, then
the app would need special Root permissions. Often targeting API calls that represent
System Calls is one of the ways to alter the source code. For that reason, source code is
an essential part in determining whether an application is malicious or not.
As mentioned above, we will be using control ow graphs converted directly from the
APK les. We are looking at the sequence of which these system calls are made and
dene them as meta paths. We were able to obtain one CFG for each APK. We extracted
this by using Androguard's AnalysisAPK method in its misc module which returns an
analysis object. Afterwards, we called .get callgraph() on the analysis object to obtain
the CFG. At this stage, we also perform some feature extraction specically on the nodes
of the graph. We extract the string representation of these nodes as well as node type.
The string representations of nodes is used to build the corpus, and the node type is used
to build meta paths. We then exported this graph as a compressed gml le to save on
disk. We hypothesize that our method will perform better than our baseline model, since
metapath2vec can capture the relations and context within the graphs, giving the feature
vector much more information. Also, our metapaths are traversed in the beginning of
our process to learn all possible metapaths. Using this method, we ensure that the model
learns the dierent sequences that a malware could have, and use this information in future
classication.
3.4 EDA
We have a total of 8435 malicious software and a total of 802 benign applications, which
is a combination of popular apks and random apps. While generating control ow graph
objects from the APK les, there was an error of \ Missing AndroidManifest.xml ,"" so we
were not able to generate those graphs and will be working with fewer benign apps1. To
counteract the imbalance between malware and benign apps, we calculated class weights
and used it in the classication process to ensure we are penalizing the model in a balanced
way.
Figure 7: Benign vs. Malicious
1We looked into why there might be missing Android Manifest les error, interestingly, we found that
some of the apps having this issue contain the manifest while some do not. However, the apps that have
this issue do not decompile correctly, and do not create a graph correctly as well.
6To further understand our benign and malicious data, we perform analysis on these
graph objects by comparing the node types, as well as the counts of both nodes and edges.
On the left of Figure 8 shows the comparisons of node types between benign applications
and malicious code. From the two distributions, we can see that malware contains a lot
more types of nodes compared to benign apps. Specically, most of the malware contains
ve types of node. If we limit the range of that bar, we can see the right of Figure 8 for a
more clear distribution of benign apps. The left distribution also indicates that majority
of the benign apps have ve types of nodes.
Figure 8: Benign vs. Malicious: Node Type Counts
But because of how imbalanced our data is, we plot the number of node types based
on the percentage, as shown below in gure 9. From this gure we can conclude that over
half of both benign and malicious apps have more than 5 types of nodes.
Figure 9: Benign vs. Malicious: Node Type Counts (%)
To further look into what are these node types, we analyze the top node types from
both benign and malware separately. The following gures (gure 10) are node types
distributions. On the left shows the benign node types spread, which over 50% of the
nodes are Public Node, followed by Node, External Node, Public Static Node, Static
Node, and the other types. Similarly, for malware, Public Node is the top most node type
found in the graphs. Followed by External Node, Node, Public Static Node, Static Node,
and the others. Both benign and malware have similar top nodes.
7Figure 10: Benign vs. Malicious: Top Node Types and The Counts
Figure 11 is a scatter plot of number of edges and number of nodes for both benign
(red) and malware (blue). Although it seems that benign has a lot more apps in this plot,
malware are just all packed together. We can also see that benign apps have larger number
of edges and nodes compared to malware, this is because benign apps are larger in terms
of APK sizes and that they might be more complicated.
Figure 11: Benign vs. Malicious: Number of Edges and Number of Nodes
Since Figure 11 has outliers for benign apps and we want to focus on the malware, we
limit the range so that it looks like this Figure 12. From this gure we see that malware
is indeed packed together and that they have a lot less edge and nodes compared to the
benign apps.

Focused)
84 Methods
4.1 Feature Extraction
For our baseline, we extract probabilistic sequences from all possible edges of the APK,
which serves as the feature vector for classication. For the Metapath2Vec model, we rst
create a common graph, then traverse it using Metapath2Vec to learn representations of
nodes, which is used to build feature vectors. For our Doc2Vec method, we treat each
APK as one document, and Doc2Vec produces one feature vector for one document.
4.2 Baseline: MamaDroid
We build Mamadroid as our baseline model. As introduced earlier, it extract call graphs
that are represented using nodes and edges. With the graphs, it extracts all the possible
edges based on the family or package level. It then extract sequences of probabilities of the
edges occurring. This probabilistic feature vector is used for classication. We abstract
API calls to both Family and Package level.
For example,
Example API call = ""LFamily/Package""
Family Level = ""LFamily""
Package Level = ""LFamily/Package""
In Family level, there are seven possible families and 100 total possible edges. However,
in Package level, there are 226 possible packages and a total of 51,239 possible edges. The
number of possible families and packages are found on Android's Developers [8] page.
Those families and packages that are not found on that webpage is abstracted to ""self-
dened"". Specically, in family level, we will obtain a feature vector of 100 elements for one
app. In package level, we obtain a feature vector with 51,239 elements for one app. These
feature vectors are then used for classication. After obtaining the vector embeddings, we
classify using Random Forest model, 1-Nearest Neighbors, and 3-Nearest Neighbors.
4.3 Metapath2Vec Model Using Common Graph
As mentioned earlier, we also abstracted our API calls to the class level. For example, an
API call looks like this: ""Lfamily/package/class; →doSomething()V"" at the class level,
it is: ""Lfamily/package/class;"". The reason for this is there could be user-dened classes,
which is not picked up in MamaDroid. We hope that we can obtain more information by
abstracting to the class level, but not get too much information at the API level which
might result in performance issues. We do not abstract anything to be ""self-dened"" as
MamaDroid has.
1. Run a Depth First Search to explore all the node types that could be in an APK,
and create metapaths.
2. Build a common graph by combining all the separate control ow graphs representing
dierent apps.
3. Perform an uniform metapath walk on the common graph to obtain a huge corpus.
4. Perform node2vec to learn node embeddings of the huge corpus.
5. Build feature vectors for each app, using the node embeddings learned from step 4,
by combining embeddings of unique nodes of each app.
6. Classication using built feature vectors.
Explanations: We run a depth rst search to explore all node types and metapaths
since we do not know how convoluted an app's CFG may be and we need exible metapaths
for each app. Also, there is the possibility of the malware being intentionally obfuscated.
Therefore, we need exible metapaths for each app, which we will later use as the prede-
ned metapaths in our metapath2vec step. The reason our feature vector is a component
wise combination of node embeddings is because when two vectors are added together, a
new vector is obtained. As visualized below:
9Figure 13: Vector Addition And Subtraction
This will provide more information about the APKs that we will classify. The model
can more easily learn the distinction between similar and dierent vectors, by the direction
and magnitude to where they point. Of course, the component wise combination can also
be other aggregations, such as taking an average, percentiles, and dot products. When
encountering an unseen app, unique nodes of that app is extracted. Representations of
each of the unique nodes are then found from the trained word2vec model, and some
component wise combination is performed to obtain a feature vector for classication.
4.4 Doc2Vec Model
1. For each app, extract all possible metapaths using Depth First Search, as well as
perform Metapath2vec on that app to obtain a corpus.
2. Take each corpus from each app, append them, and turn them into a list of Tagged
Documents.
3. Run the Tagged Documents into Doc2Vec to obtain a vector representation for each
app.
4. Take the vector representations for each tagged document, and use them as feature
vectors for classication.
The Doc2Vec model is very straight forward, taking in documents and returning rep-
resentations for those documents. When there is an unseen app, a corpus is extracted
from that app using metapath and is treated as a document. This document is then fed
into the Doc2Vec model, and a vector representation is ""inferred"" using the .infer vector()
method.
5 Results and Discussion
5.1 Baseline
The following tables are results from our baseline model, MamaDroid, corresponding to
Family and Package mode. Surprisingly, our MamaDroid using control ow graphs per-
forms better than its original model. Let's rst take a look at the Family mode. The table
(Table 3) below is the confusion matrix, we calculated precision and recall scores based on
it.
Random Forest 1-NN 3-NN
True Negative 68 61 59
False Negative 4 9 8
False Positive 11 18 20
True Positive 1269 1264 1265
Table 3: Baseline Results (Confusion Matrix): Family
We compare the results to the original MamaDroid model [1]. In Table 4, we list the
original MamaDroid results on it as well to better compare it. We see that our version
of MamaDroid has better performance in all F1-Score, precision and recall scores, where
we obtain an F measure of 0.994 and the original model only has 0.880. Similarly to
precision and recall scores, we obtain 0.991 and 0.997, where the original model has 0.840
and 0.920 as their results. In addition to Random Forest, our 1-NN and 3-NN models also
outperform the original MamaDroid model. But all our three models have similar results.
10PCA = 10 ComponentsRandom Forest1-NN 3-NNOriginal Ours
F1-Score 0.880 0.994 0.980 0.994
Precision 0.840 0.991 0.985 0.994
Recall 0.920 0.997 0.994 0.994
Table 4: Baseline Results (F1-Score, Precision, Recall): Family
Next, we have results for our MamaDroid Package mode. Table 5 is the confusion
matrix. The numbers are close to what we obtain for Family level. However, the true
negatives for all three similarity-based models are slightly larger.
Random Forest 1-NN 3-NN
True Negative 70 70 70
False Negative 1 6 1
False Positive 15 15 15
True Positive 1266 1261 1266
Table 5: Baseline Results (Confusion Matrix): Package
We also compared the results of Package mode to the original MamaDroid results.
In Table 6, we also list out the results of original MamaDroid on the left to compare it
with the ones we obtain. As a result, our model was able to achieve an F measure of
0.993, precision score of 0.988, and recall score of 0.999, whereas the original model only
has performance of 0.940, 0.940, and 0.950. Both 1-NN and 3-NN models also have very
similar numbers as Random Forest model.
PCA = 10 ComponentsRandom Forest1-NN 3-NNOriginal Ours
F1-Score 0.940 0.993 0.992 0.994
Precision 0.940 0.988 0.988 0.988
Recall 0.950 0.999 0.995 0.999
Table 6: Baseline Results (F1-Score, Precision, Recall): Package
5.2 Metapath2Vec/Common Graph (Partial)
For our Metapath2Vec model, we unfortunately do not have the complete results due to
large computational time it takes to build the common graph with all the data we have.
The complete common graph consists of 1,950,729 nodes, and 215,604,110 edges. However,
we did obtain results working with a smaller subset of the Common Graph, consisting of:
87,539 nodes and 15,617,223 edges.
Random Forest 1-NN 3-NN
True Negative 94 89 73
False Negative 16 31 36
False Positive 20 25 41
True Positive 1679 1664 1659
Table 7: Metapath2Vec Results (Confusion Matrix)
We tested on the entire test set, and surprisingly the performance was okay. Initially,
we thought that there might be an error, however, upon inspecting our code, we were
traversing the smaller common graph correctly. We believe we can obtain this result
because of the large amount of edges in the common graph as well as our walk length
of each traversal to 500. We set the walk length to 500 to compensate for the smaller
subset of graphs that we are using, and therefore can capture more information per walk.
Because of this, the Word2Vec model can learn more about those nodes and provide a
better representation.
11Random Forest 1-NN 3-NN
F1-Score 0.989 0.983 0.977
Precision 0.992 0.966 0.982
Recall 0.642 0.959 0.959
Table 8: Metapath2Vec Results (F1-Score, Precision, Recall)
Even though the F1-Scores were high, our True Negative and False Positives are higher
than our baseline and Doc2vec model. This is again due to the smaller subset that we
are using for this experiment. Because of the smaller subset, we do not have a lot of
representations for nodes. There could have been some nodes that the Word2vec model
has never seen before, and therefore cannot infer a good representation for it.
5.3 Doc2Vec
The following tables are the results for Doc2Vec with our similarity-based models: Random
Forest, 1-NN, and 3-NN. Table 9 is the confusion matrix, which is used to compute the
precision and recall scores. The Doc2Vec performed worse than the baseline model on the
Random Forest model, and it seems like it was struggling with classifying benign apps.
Random Forest 1-NN 3-NN
True Negative 109 56 43
False Negative 606 68 71
False Positive 5 58 31
True Positive 1089 1627 1664
Table 9: Doc2Vec Results (Confusion Matrix)
In Table 10, we have our F measure, precision, and recall scores. We notice that our
Random Forest model only has an F measure of 0.781, which is a lot lower than our
baseline. On the other hand, both our k Nearest Neighbors perform much better than
Random Forest. The Random Forest classier has an emphasis on certain features when
training, and focuses on some feature more than others. However, the 1-NN and 3-NN
models both look at an unseen vector's closest neighbors, therefore utilizing all the features
in the vector. We believe this is why the 1-NN and 3-NN models performed better in this
experiment.
Random Forest 1-NN 3-NN
F1-Score 0.781 0.963 0.970
Precision 0.992 0.966 0.982
Recall 0.642 0.959 0.959
Table 10: Doc2Vec Results (F1-Score, Precision, Recall)
6 Conclusion, Discussion, and Future Work
In conclusion, our baseline model is able to achieve a better performance than the original
work that we have studied. Although our Doc2Vec did not perform better than the baseline
Random Forest model, our k Nearest Neighbors models performed almost as good as our
baseline. From this, we can see that Control Flow Graphs might be a good choice when
it comes to choosing representations for source code. Again, control ow graphs show the
jumps in code. From our EDA: Figure 11, even though malware has a small number of
nodes, they have a large amount of edges. This means that there could be lots of instances
where the program is jumping around in the source code. All this is recorded in the CFG
representation and could provide much more information about an APK.
Although we successfully created a complete common graph, we were unable to obtain
all the node embeddings from it due to time and memory constraints. Therefore we built
a smaller common graph to see how it performs. If time and resources allowed, we hope
to nish the metapath traversal of the complete common graph. Judging from the results
using the smaller common graph, if we were to scale up the model might out-perform our
baseline.
For our future work, we plan on investigating other vector embeddings technique and
perhaps instead of using only similarity-based models, we could also implement graph
12neural networks (GNN). In addition to neural networks, we are also interested in graph
classication specically. Since our data format is already in the form of multiple apps,
it can be easy to normalize and transform data for a GNN model. Of so many researches
we have seen on malware detection, not a lot of them uses control ow graphs as their
input data. Since our experiments conrmed that using control ow graphs is not any
worse than using other forms of data, we are curious to know if control ow graphs can
outperform in other models.

ABSTRACT
As the technology grows fast in recent years, more and
more people cannot live without cell phones. It is im-
portant to protect users’ data for cell phone companies
and operating system providers. Therefore, detecting mal-
wares based on the code they have can avoid publishing
of malwares and prohibiting them from the source. This
report aims at finding a model which can detect malwares
accurately and with a small computational cost. It uses
different matrices and graphs to search the relationships
between applications and detecting malwares based on
the similarity. As a result, the best model can achieve a
test accuracy around 99%.
1 INTRODUCTION
As the internet techniques are growing at a fast speed
nowadays, people are starting to worry about their
data safety. Since many of us will store our impor-
tant information on our cellphones, we need to find
an appropriate way to secure our cell phone away from
malwares. As the operating system which takes over
80% of the cellphone market, Android operating system
is always a large target for malwares. Since the An-
droid system uses an open market where everyone has
the ability to upload application packages, malwares
can easily be uploaded and spread among the inter-
net. In addition, malwares can easily evade detection
by repackaging or using code obfuscation. As a severe
problem faced by Android, it is important to detect
the malwares to ensure the safety of user’s data. Lots
of scholars are starting to participate in the malware
detection research area. Many new technologies are
being applied to the malware detection area, includ-
ing Machine Learning strategies and Natural Language
Processing (NLP) methodologies.
In order to develop a more powerful tool for mal-
ware detection, we do not only focus on Application
Programming Interfaces(API). Some other features, likethe same return type or same package name, are also
considered. Those features can help us find the inner
relationships among applications. By using the idea of
Heterogeneous Information Network(HIN), we use ma-
trices to represent each kind of relationship. Aiming at
developing a faster model for malware detection, we
also use TF-IDF(term frequency - inverse document
frequency) to select out part of APIs and use them for
model construction. Besides matices, graphs are also
considered as features for the implementation of classi-
fiers. Using the logic of Network Representation Learn-
ing and NLP, we are able to change matices to different
graphs where edges represent different kinds of rela-
tionships. We compare all those models and find some
useful models for malware detection within a quick
speed. Related Work
2 RELATED WORK
In recent years, lots of studies are focused in the area of
Intelligent Android malware detection systems. They
use machine learning and data mining strategies to con-
tribute their model for detecting malwares. And our
project is based on previous research on such kind of
malware detection, especially HinDroid[3]. HinDroid
focuses on utilizing API features in code and customiz-
ing kernels to identify malwares. It uses multi-kernel
with different assigned probabilities as its final model
for malware detection. HinDroid is based on the static
method which focuses on the internal component of
an application. There is also some previous research re-
lated to Network Representation Learning. Word2Vec[4]
designs a new simple way to represent words. It learns
the word vector using the Skip-gram model which pre-
dicts the previous and future words based on current
words. Node2Vec[2] is an algorithm used for learning
the feature representation for nodes by random walks.
Metapath2Vec[1] is the scalable representation algo-
rithm which formalizes the random walks by metapath.Yikai Hao, Yu-Chieh Chen, and Ruoyu Liu
This report implements those algorithms to generate
graphs for classifiers and use them to detect malwares.
3 DATA OVERVIEW
3.1 Data Source
The data source is called Android Malware Dataset
(AMD). The dataset is published in 2017 by the Argus
Lab from the University of South Florida. This data
source is used by many other malware detection papers
and widely used in the research domain.
3.2 Data Description
The original source is the APK(Android Application
Package), which can be decompiled by Apktool. After
decompiling, we select smali files, which are a type of
files containing a proxy of the original code, specifically
for detecting malwares. We select 905 malwares and 905
benigns from the dataset. Benigns are separated in two
categories - popular applications and random applica-
tions. Popular applications are those on the application
chart for top downloads. And random applications are
random applications selected from apkpure.
3.3 Smali File
In order to analyze the smali files, we should under-
stand the structure of it. Therefore, figure 1 shows the
description of the smali files and the features contained
in the smali files.
Figure 1: Smali Structure
The basic components of a Smali file are the follow-
ing:-Class information : In this example, Lbolts/a is the class
name for this file.
-Static fields : It contains the shared variables among
whole class
-Method direct virtual : It contains the methods in the
original java file. This is the part we will use to extract
our main feature - API and other related features.
3.4 API Calls
In order to understand which part of the smali files
do the malicious action, we put our attention on API
(Application Programming Interface) calls. There are
four main components in an API call.
Figure 2: API Call Example
The basic components of an API call are the follow-
ing:
-Invoke method : there are five methods to invoke in API
calls, including invoke-static, invoke-virtual, invoke-
direct, invoke-super, and invoke-interface.
-API package
-Method name
-Return type of the method
3.5 Data Extraction
After understanding the data structure of the data source
and the exact data section we want to focus on, we start
the data extraction process. We decide to use api name,
class type, package type, code block number, method
type, return type, and invoke type to be our features.
Those features almost include every kind of informa-
tion we can get from the smali file. In addition, we also
do some EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) to make sure
every feature we get is distributed differently among
different types of applications. Therefore, the features
can present the original data and they are useful hints
to detect malwares.
3.6 Database
We design a special database to store the data we get.
Since the main feature is the api, there are over 2 mil-
lions unique apis and more than 50 millions apis ap-
peared in different smali files. Separated csv files and
unique ids are used to store the specific unique stringMalware Detection
values and represent the string value. Then, in the main
csv files, we store the unique ids from different refer-
ences. This will reduce the space and time dramatically.
For example, our storage originally will take up to 90G
spaces and now only takes 1.7G. The structure of the
database is shown in figure 3.
3.7 Data Statistics
After picking out the features we want, we do some
simple analysis based on the data we have. As the ta-
ble shows, the size difference between malwares and
benigns are huge. In addition, the unique api calls in
benigns are about 10 times larger than malwares. There-
fore, the difference between malwares and benigns do
exists and we are able to find some way to detect mal-
wares. The statistics is shown in table 1.
4 MODEL
4.1 Feature distribution
In order to check whether the features we generate
are useful for checking malwares, some Exploratory
Data Analysis (EDA) has done on features. We check
the difference between unique values among features
considered the type of applications. The result shows
that our features can clearly identify the different types
of applications since the value between different types
of applications are large (table 2).
We also plot out some distributions of features con-
sidering different types. Taking the number of unique
return types for example (figure 4), malwares are of-
ten having a relatively small number of unique val-
ues. However, popular applications are always having
a large number of unique return types. Random appli-
cations are more spread over the x-axis, but still more
condensed at a large number of unique return types.
Therefore, the number of unique return types will be a
useful feature to detect malwares.
4.2 HinDroid
HinDroid [3] is the baseline model we use for our report.
It contains different types of kernels and the meaning
behind each kernel is different. It uses the features we
extract from the data generating process to build some
matrices. Each matrix shows a type of relationship be-
tween apis or applications. Each matrix is an adjacent
matrix for a graph with a specialized relationship. Bychoosing different types of matrices we want to com-
bine together, we get the kernel we have. Then we will
be able to use the custom kernels and put in different
classifiers like SVM or Random Forest for malware de-
tection.
The four types of matrices are: A, B, P, and I matrices.
•A matrix shows the connection among apis and
applications. The value within the A matrix will
be one if the application contains the api.
•B matrix shows the connection between apis. The
value within the B matrix shows whether two apis
are contained in the same code block.
•P matrix also shows the connection between apis.
The value within the P matrix shows whether two
apis use the same package.
•I matrix shows the connection within the apis.
The value within the I matrix shows whether two
apis use the same invoke type.
Currently, due to the large size of the unique apis we
get, we are not able to calculate out the I matrix yet.
Therefore, the kernel we have now for HinDroid is AA⊤,
ABA⊤,APA⊤, andAPBP⊤A⊤.
4.3 New Model
The HinDroid model runs pretty slow since there are a
large number of APIs. However, lots of APIs only appear
once among all applications and they are meaningless
for detecting malwares. In addition, there are also some
APIs which appeared in almost every application. Those
APIs are also not meaningful enough to help us pick
out the malwares. Therefore, new models are being
considered and built. Based on the logic of HinDroid,
we try to develop some new matrices to replace the
original matrices which will have a faster speed and
similar accuracy.
4.3.1 Reduce API / Pack. The inspiration of this method
comes from the MAMADROID [5]. Instead of using the
whole API call, API name and API library have been
selected separately. The number of unique API calls for
around 2000 applications are originally over 1,000,000.
We design two new matrices based on the separation
of values in an API call, which is shown in Figure 2.
•Reduce API: This matrix only contains the API
Name, which is the red part in the example. The
new matrix size is around 130,000 x 130,000, which
is way smaller than the original A matrix.Yikai Hao, Yu-Chieh Chen, and Ruoyu Liu

Figure 4: Log Scaled of Unique API Return Type
•Reduce Pack: This matrix only contains the API
Library, which is the blue part in the example. Thenew matrix size is around 350,000 x 350,000. The
size is about 2/3 smaller than the original A matrix
4.3.2 TF-IDF. Besides Reduce API and Reduce Pack, we
are also considering can we select out some APIs which
are considered “important” for detecting malwares. The
method we choose is TF-IDF(term frequency - inverse
document frequency). It is a useful method to check the
importance of a word for a document. We generate a
corpus list which each element in the list is representing
a corpus for an application. In each corpus, it contains
all API calls. We then use the TF-IDF to get a token
score for each API call. After calculating the mean score
over all corpus, part of the API calls are selected out
according to their rank. The numbers we select out are
Top1000, Top2000, Top5000, and Top10000.Malware Detection
Top3 API Example Rank by TF-IDF
Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;->append()
Ljava/lang/StringBuilder;->toString()
Ljava/lang/Integer;->valueOf()
Table 3: TF-IDF Top 3 API Example
4.3.3 New Features. New features are also being con-
sidered to build new matrices. We use the return type
as our new feature and build a matrix called R. The
element in the R matrix represents whether two appli-
cations are using the same return type. R matrix can
replace the original A matrix and its size is only around
170,000 x 170,000. As the feature description part shown,
the return type is also a useful feature to detect mal-
wares. Additionally, in order to build a new kernel for
the R matrix, the new B_R matrix represents whether
two return types are in the same code block. Therefore,
we have two different kernels - RR and RB_RR What’s
more, we also built a new I matrix after finishing the
API reduction. This also provides more kernel options
while putting the features into classifiers.
We design lots of new matrices which can replace the
original A matrix using new features or reduced num-
ber of APIs. Those matrices will be used when we are
building kernels.
4.4 Word2Vec
Word2Vec is the new vector embedding we generate.
This model is a powerful NLP model to help us find not
only the direct relationship between apps but also the
cluster connection between apps using the graph, which
is a different approach to solve the malware detection
problem with HinDroid.
Our Word2Vec takes AA⊤as an input and builds a
graph based on the AA⊤. Therefore, the graph contains
two components - applications and apis. We then gen-
erate sentences as our input for the Word2Vec model.
Firstly, we randomly pick an app out, then we follow
the path in the graph to search for the next api and
app. We will end our path with an app. The length of
the path will be a number randomly chosen within the
range of maximum length.
For example, with a maximum length of 5000 and a
metapath AA⊤, the possible text generated will be like:APP1 −> API234 −> APP34 −> API12 −>
After finishing the sentence generating process, we will
implement the genism’s Word2Vec model to get our
vector embeddings for every application and api. The
final vector embeddings will be easily used in different
machine learning models.
We use data visualization to check if our model makes
sense. Our plot shows the vector embeddings after the
dimension reduction using a method called t-SNE(t-
distributed stochastic neighbor embedding). This method
can project a high dimensional vector into a two dimen-
sional space. t-SNE uses Barnes-Huts approximations
to reduce the dimensions. As the graph shows (figure
5), the distribution of malwares and benigns are sepa-
rated. Benigns are condensed at the left side with small
x and y values. However, malwares are distributed at
the right side, with a large x value and widespread y
value. From the information on the graph, the model
can detect malwares well. Although a few points are
mixed in the graph, they might be separable in higher
dimensions.
Figure 5: Word2Vec Embedding Visualization
4.5 Node2Vec
The only difference between Node2Vec and Word2Vec
is the random walk procedure. This change improves
the inability of Word2Vec and tracks the path with no
specific rules about where to go.
We use all A, B, and P matrices to build our Node2Vec.
Since the B and P matrices both represent the relation-
ships between apis, we combine the two matrices intoYikai Hao, Yu-Chieh Chen, and Ruoyu Liu
one larger matrix to replace the B and P matrices. The
values within the large matrix represent whether two
apis have some relationships, no matter whether they
are within the same code block or use the same package.
For the probability of random walks, there are three
types of probability. For example, we have a path from
t -> v shown in figure 6. When choosing the next step
for v, we have three different probabilities. If we get
from v -> t, we have a probability of 1/p. In addition, if
the next node from v has a connection with t, then the
probability of the node will be 1. Other nodes will have
a probability with 1/q. We then implement sentences
into the genism’s Node2Vec model. The p value we
select in our Node2Vec is 1 and the q value we select is
1/2. We choose a larger p value since we do not want
our path going back to its previous node.
Figure 6: Node2Vec Formula
Similar to Word2Vec, we also plot out the vector em-
beddings after finishing the dimension reduction (figure
7).
Figure 7: Node2Vec Embedding Visualization
4.6 Metapath2Vec
Methpath2Vec is an extension of Node2Vec on hetero-
geneous graphs. The difference between Metapath2Vecand Node2Vec is that the Metapath2Vec assigns a path
for the random walk and decides where the next node
to go. The Metapath2Vec model uses all A, B, and P ma-
trices. The sampling method of Metapath2Vec is based
on the equation (1), which means the next node will be
accessed if the edge exists and the node belongs to the
correct type. For example, if the path given is ABA⊤,
we will generate a sentence from an app to an api first.
Then we will check the next node is an api which is in
the same code block with the previous api. Finally, our
path will go to another app. We repeat this loop until
we reach the maximum length we set or have no next
node.
We then implement sentences into the genism’s Word2Vec
model. After the dimension reduction process is done,
the embedding plot is shown in figure 8.

5 RESULT
Below are the results of different models.
5.1 Classifiers
After different models are built, SVM(Support-Vector
Machines), Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting are
selected as classifiers while doing the final malwareMalware Detection
detection. SVM is the baseline classifier we choose. It
uses different matrices as custom kernels to classify
the type of applications. Random Forest and Gradient
Boosting both use decision trees as their base. Decision
tree is a tree model in which each node represents a
decision rule that separates the dataset. Random forest
uses the idea of “Bagging”. It builds lots of decision trees
at the same time using a subset from the dataset. Then,
Random Forest will combine the result with weight and
produce the final prediction. Gradient Boosting uses
another idea called “Boosting”. It will also build lots
of decision trees. And Gradient Boosting will update
the newest model by making improvement on the last
model.
The classifier with highest accuracy will be chosen
as the classifier of a specific model. As the result ta-
ble shows, most classifiers will be SVM. However, the
Node2vec model shows a preference on Gradient Boost-
ing.
5.2 Result Tables
As the table 4, train accuracy, test accuracy, and F1 score
are the values to evaluate the performance of the model.
We also include False Positive and True Negative count
to check which kind of error will the model make.
As the result table 4 shows, the best performance is
the original HinDroid model with AA⊤kernel and SVM
classifier. It can achieve a test accuracy around 99% with
only three benigns misrecognized as malwares. And
the reduced API with top 2000 APIs selected by TF-IDF
also has a similar accuracy. It can achieve a 99% test
accuracy by AA⊤kernel and SVM classifier.
The table 4 also shows that most of the models per-
form best under more baseline kernel and classifier.
With a kernel AA⊤and classifier SVM, most models
reach their highest test accuracy. However, using differ-
ent kernels like ABA⊤orAPBP⊤A⊤, the classifier will
switch to Gradient Boosting or Random Forest with a
slightly lower test accuracy.
In addition, when comparing the results of reduced
API kernels we build for new models, we find out that
the accuracy is high enough to do prediction. Most of
them have a test accuracy around 99%, which is higher
than models based on graphs. Graph models, including
Word2Vec, Node2Vec, and Metapath2Vec, are perform-
ing the poorest among all models, shown in table 5.
With a much less time complexity, reduced API kernelscan be considered as a powerful tool to replace basic
HinDroid with similar test accuracy.
Most models perform better on detecting malwares.
However, most of the mistakes in identifying the type
of applications make on benigns. As the table indicated,
most False Positive values are much higher than False
Negative values. As a malware detection model, our
model should be more focused on detecting every mal-
ware out. Therefore, having some misclassified benigns
within an acceptable rate is allowed. Multi-kernel might
not be a useful improvement since the original Hin-
Droid model already has the best performance on False
Positive.
5.3 Research on Misclassified App
After seeing the result, we do some research on the mis-
recognized applications. As the table 6 shown, the orig-
inal HinDroid model with metapath AA⊤and classifier
SVM only missed 3 applications. Those three applica-
tions are considered to be False Positive, which means
that they should be benigns but identified as malwares.
We select those 3 applications out and find that they are
all in the category Random application. By checking the
features used for malware detection and comparing it
with the 25% - 75% range for both malwares and benigns,
those applications are at the boundary of malwares and
benigns. Therefore, it is reasonable for the classifier to
misrecognizing those applications. In addition, as the
Data Description section mentioned, random applica-
tions are selected randomly out of apkpure. There is a
small possibility that those three applications are actu-
ally malwares. There is a small possibility that those
three applications are actually malwares.
6 CONCLUSION
In this report, we implement different methods for mal-
ware detection. Based on the weakness we find in us-
ing HinDroid, we also design some new matrices and
kernels in order to save space and time. As the result
section shows, the outcome is positive. With a much
smaller matrix and time complexity, the new model
can perform as well as the original HinDroid model.
Although graph-based models do not perform as well
as kernel based models, they are achieving a high ac-
curacy around 95%. Graph is still a useful strategy to

consider while detecting malwares since it can catch
the cluster relationship among applications.
There is lots of future exploration that can be done
based on current results. For example, we can imple-
ment the multi-kernel idea to combine high accuracy
models together in order to improve our overall accu-
racy. The reducing API by using TF-IDF can also be
applied to other research areas while we want to savetime complexity. New matrix with return types as its el-
ement also performs well on test accuracy. Thus, some
further studies can be done on this feature. We can
also extract out most common applications which are
misclassified and understand the reason behind it.Malware Detection

Abstract
Due to the burgeoning of machine learning and articial intelligence technology,
it may feel as though there are eyes perpetually watching us. It is undeniable that,
whether it is through surveillance cameras, phones, or desktops, we are always exposed
to being analyzed by merely living our everyday lives. The most frightening part
about this phenomenon is that most people are unaware of what is actually being seen
and how. As our society begins to yield more responsibility and credibility to image
analysis and other machine learning software, it is important to educate the public about
them. Our interactive web application conducts facial analysis and utilizes explainable
articial intelligence (XAI) to aid in communicating the inner-workings of the machine
learning ""black box."" In addition, we discuss the importance of model fairness, role
of XAI in ensuring fairness, and potential discriminatory practices that stem from the
imprudent use of machine learning.

1 Introduction
The problems that we are investigating focus around how we can detect model bias in a
race classication model. It can be dicult for users to interpret a complex model's results
especially when it seems to be generating biased or unethical results. Therefore, we want
to explore how we can apply explainable AI techniques to generate visual explanations to
interpret the performance of a race classication model. We will need to research how to use
neural network models and activation map algorithms to produce these visual explanations.
This problem is particularly interesting because it addresses challenging concepts related
to image classication through techniques cited in the explainable AI eld for detecting
model bias. We want to be able to generate interpetable and detailed visual explanations
that explain what specic features a race classication model focuses on when making its
1predictions. It is especially challenging to localize salient facial features doing so requires
distinguishing small details to capture from an input facial image. Therefore, we will use
class activation map algorithms to show the salient features models highlight when making
their predictions and how it is able to generalize to new faces. It would also be really useful
to implement visual question answering to be able to ask the model specic questions about
characteristics such as the race/ethnicity, gender, and age of the person to observe if the
model's answers are appropriate and accurate.
Our eventual goal is to have a better understanding of why the model is making its
predictions, in hopes that it will establish better trust between users and the model and also
show how the model might need to be improved. This can be accomplished by developing a
tool that takes in an input image and generates activation heatmaps and can also generate
condence scores for its answers to visual question answering tasks to measure the success
of the model's performance.

Our project uses the FairFace dataset to perform classication and analysis. FairFace
supplies 108501 images of faces from an equally distributed pool of seven race categories, two
genders, and nine age groups. Figure 1 displays some samples from the FairFace dataset
and Figure 2 shows the distribution of race for FairFace dataset. In addition to being
uniquely comprehensive and applicable to our project, the size of this dataset allows us to
create subsets of the data in order to display biased training sets. The biased dataset was
generated based on the actual US population as recorded in the 2019 US Census dataset:
White: 60%, Black: 13%, Latino Hispanics: 18.5%, East Asian: 2.2%, Southeast Asian:
2.2%, Indian: 1.2%, Middle Eastern: 2.4%.

3 Methods
3.1 Model
We used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as our model. We applied transfer
learning with resnet50 by taking the rst 14 layers and xing their weights. Then, we
concatenated them with our self-dened layers. We preprocessed the training images by
resizing it to 224 x 224 x 3 and applied the resnet50 preprocessing function from Keras and
adding random rotation, horizontal ip, and vertical ip.
The parameters for training are listed as follows: batch size = 128, learning rate =
30.008, optimizer = Nadam, loss = categorical cross entropy. The learning rate is halved if
the validation loss does not decrease for 10 consecutive epochs and early stopping would
be triggered if the validation loss does not decrease for 30 consecutive epochs.
We trained a total of 4 models for dierent classes: age, race, and gender and one biased
model for race. All the models are trained with the same model architecture dened above
except the last output layer is being adjusted by the number of categories each class has. We
achieved 66% accuracy on race, 55% on age, 91% on gender, and 38% accuracy on biased
race models. The training accuracy and loss curves are displayed in the Appendix(Figure
11-18).
3.2 Explainable AI (XAI)
XAI techniques can be implemented to help with model interpretability by visually
showing what parts of our input face images our custom trained model is focusing on when
making its predictions/classications. We used the Grad-CAM and Integrated Gradients
algorithms to generate heatmaps that are class discriminative but have coarse localiza-
tion. We used an implementation of Grad-CAM in Keras to take in our custom trained
models and to generate heat maps given an input facial image from the FairFace dataset.
This implementation is compatible with Tensorow and Keras 2.0, and this architecture is
applicable to any CNN model architecture.
3.2.1 Grad-CAM
The Grad-CAM algorithm focuses on the feature maps from the nal convolutional layer in
the neural network since this last convolutional layer would store the most detailed spatial
and semantic information about the features in the input image. Then, the feature maps
produced from this layer are fed into the fully connected layers which add weights to the
features to then get the probabilities for each class. The class with the highest probability
is chosen as the classication/prediction y for the input image. The calculation steps for
the Grad-CAM is the following:
1. Compute the gradient of the prediction y (raw score) with respect to the feature maps
generated from the nal convolutional layer.
42. The feature maps from the nal convolutional layer are weighted using \alpha values""
which are calculated by averaging the gradients using Global Average Pooling. These
weights represent the importance weight of a feature map k to the target class c.
3. Calculate the Grad-CAM heatmap by calculating the weighted combination of the
feature maps with its weights. The ReLU function is applied to put more importance
on the positive values and replace the negative values with 0.
Then, the heatmap resulting from this Grad-CAM procedure needs to be resized to
match the dimensions of the input image so that it can overlay on top of it to return the
nal visualization. Figure 3 shows the general process of applying Grad-CAM to a CNN
architecture. Figure 4 shows how the Grad-CAM algorithm can be applied to a that is
trained specically for racial classication.
Figure 3: The general steps of performing Grad-CAM
5Figure 4: The illustration of how Grad-CAM can be applied to racial classication. The
network chooses the best classication label from 4 dierent races but in our specic
application we have 7 dierent racial classications
3.2.2 Integrated-Gradient
Integrated-Gradient (IG) explains the relationship between the predictions and the
learned features. Unlike Grad-CAM that only looks at the nal convolutional layer from the
CNN model, IG takes the entire model into account. IG requires a baseline, such as black or
white background, and a set of interpolated images from a given input image. The gradient
maps for each interpolated image are being calculated. For example, if an input image has
size 224x224x3, the gradient map will also have the same size of the image because gradient
is calculated by taking the derivative of a particular output channel w.r.t a pixel. We do
this for every pixel, hence produce the gradient map that has the same size as the input
image. Then, we take the average of the gradient maps for each interpolated image and
multiply by a scaling factor to produce the heatmap. The value of the heatmap is simply
the gradient of each pixel. This heatmap displays a decent face localization resolution for
the input image. Figure 5 illustrates the steps of performing IG thoroughly.
This equation summarizes integrated gradient:

where xi= input image, x0
i= baseline, m= total number of interpolated images, F= output channel
The general procedure of IG is as follows:

across multiple interpolated images are in the same units and faithfully represent the
pixel importance on the input image

4 Results
We displayed the heatmaps generated with Grad-CAM and IG for both the fair race
model and the biased race model. We selected four samples that include Indian, White,
East Asian, and Black people. Figures 6-9 show the results of our works. The rst row
contains the Grad-CAM results, the second row includes the Guided-Grad-CAM results,
and the third row contains The IG results. We will not discuss Guided-Grad-CAM because
it is just an alternative visualization of Grad-CAM.
Figure 6 is an image of a young Indian girl. The fair model predicted the race correctly
as Indian, but the biased model predicted Latino Hispanic. In this example, the Grad-CAM
results for the fair model show a strong focus on the eye region, and the biased model covers
a similar region, but the activation is not as strong. The IG result for the fair model shows
a robust face localization, and the biased model does not show apparent features captured
7by the model. The Indian race was underrepresented in the biased dataset, which can be
depicted by the biased and unbiased models' performance after applying Grad-CAM and
IG.
Figure 7 is an image is of a White lady. The fair model predicted White and shows
that the model made its prediction by focusing on the region around the eye. The biased
model that also predicted White shows a slight amount of activation in the same eye region.
These results depict that the fair model was stronger in this case since it had more robust
activation for the highlighted features than the biased model, which seems to be the weaker
model. The biased model appears to have weaker activation since in the biased dataset
White is the over-represented race and therefore could be assumed as a default prediction
which led to the model not picking out specic salient features to make its classication.
The same reasoning applies to IG. The heatmap generated by the fair model shows stronger
activation depicted by the pixel's intensity, but the heatmap generated by the biased model
shows clearer face localization, and the face shape is easier to identify. This example shows
even when two models make the same prediction, users can use Grad-CAM and IG to
distinguish the stronger and weaker model.
Figure 8 is an image of an East Asian lady. The Grad-CAM shows that the fair model
focuses on the eye's inner region, whereas there are not many activations for any facial
features for the biased model. This could explain why the biased model's accuracy for this
race is relatively low since it did not learn any specic features to classify this image. The
IG heatmaps generated by both models show decent face localization. But the heatmap
generated by the fair model has more activation for the face features by showing a more
apparent face pattern.
Figure 9 is an image of a Black gentleman. The fair and biased model both predicted
Black, but in this example, you can see from the Grad-CAM results that the biased model
seems to show better results since it shows more robust activation on the face than the fair
model. This example shows that the fair model seems to not perform as well for classifying
the men in the Black race even though it makes the correct prediction and the biased model
had an easier time picking out features that represented the Black race. We noticed that
on Black women the fair model was able to pick out facial features to focus on so this shows
that maybe in the biased dataset the gender is not distributed evenly for the Black race.
8On the other hand, the biased model successfully picked out features that represented the
Black race. However, the IG heatmaps generated by both models display a robust face
localization. This example shows that we can utilize dierent XAI techniques to evaluate
the model. Perhaps in the fair model, the model does not show a robust object detection,
but by looking at IG heatmaps, we know that the model does localize the face well. If you
want to see more results, please visit our GitHub and follow the instructions to play around
with our code!

95 Discussion
We compared the heatmaps generated with the fair race model and the biased race. The
Grad-CAM visualized the important features well and the Integrated gradient visualized
the face localization well. Overall, the fair race model has better heatmap representations.
We are aware that we only show the four heatmaps samples. We did not nd a solution to
calculate the aggregate heatmap with respect to each class(e.g. the heatmap for White peo-
ple). The reason is that the face from each image is located at a dierent place. Therefore,
calculating the aggregate heatmap would not make sense. However, it is worth investigating
a solution to align face from each image to the same location so that the aggregate heatmap
can be calculated. Another issue that we'd encountered is the training data quality. In the
FairFace dataset, some images have faces facing sideways and some images have very poor
resolution. We displayed some poor images from the dataset in Figure 9. The rst two
rows include images with face facing sideways and the last row includes images that either
have poor resolution or have multiple faces. Our models are susceptible to make wrong
predictions for those images and this indirectly inuences the quality of the heatmaps gen-
erated by XAI techniques. We should denitely clean the dataset so that the models are
trained with high quality data and can yield higher accuracy for model predictions and
better heatmaps visualization.

faces that are facing sideways. The last row includes poor resolution images
106 Conclusion
Improving the model's explainability is a crucial step to understand AI. We trained CNN
models and visualized the heatmaps for input images using Grad-CAM and Integrated-
Gradient algorithms. We compared the heatmaps between the fair race model and the
biased race model and show that the fair race model is able to capture more salient features
through the heatmaps visualization. This demonstrates the importance of having a fair
dataset beforehand and possible unintentional caveat to develop a biased model if the
dataset is not ideal.

INTRODUCTION
Over the past decade, malware has established itself as a constant issue for the Android operating system. In
2018, S ymantec reported that they blocked more than 10 thousand malicious Android apps per day, while nearly
3 quarters of Android devices remained on older versions of Android. With billions of active Android devices,
millions are only a swipe away from becoming victims. Naturally, automated machine learning-based detection
systems have become commonplace solutions as they can parse through thousands of apps in seconds.
However, it has been shown that many of these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, notably those that
add redundant code to malware in an attempt to mislead detectors.
In our project, we introduce a new model that extends the Hindroid detection system  by employing node
embeddings using metapath2vec  which we call m2vDroid. W e believe that the introduction of node embeddings
will improve the performance of our model beyond the capabilities of HinDroid. Second, we attempt to attack
these models with adversarial machine learning using a method similar to that proposed in the paper Android
HIV. Specifically, we aim to find a way to add small changes to malware so that it may evade a detector. W e
hope that this will serve as a first step to determining the robustness of these models against adversarial attacks.
Preliminaries
There are a few concepts that we should introduce before we get into details:
Definition 1)  A Heterogeneous Infor mation Netw ork (HIN)  is a graph in which its nodes and edges have
different types.
Definition 2)  A Metap ath is a path within a HIN that follows certain node types. For example, let us define a
HIN with a set of node types  and a path  of length .  follows
metapath  if  for all .
PREVIOUS WORKS
Hindroid
Hindroid is a malware detection system developed in 2017 by Hou, et al and is a significant inspiration for our
model, m2vDroid. In it, they ""represent Android apps, related APIs, and their rich relations as a heterogeneous
information network"" and was one of the first to apply this method for the detection of malware. T o build their
heterogeneous information network, they unpack and decompile Android apps into the readable smali  format
and extract information for each API call (Notably, their code block, package, and invoke method). With this
data, they construct 4 matrices which serve as adjacency matrices for Apps and APIs in the heterogeneous
information network:T P=n1⟶n2⟶...⟶nN NP

PIf  and  have the same package name, then ; 
otherwise, .
IIf  and  have the same invocation type, then ; 
otherwise, .
Using these relationships, they form metapaths between all apps. For example, the metapath 
 which is captured by the  kernel. Other kernels they consider include 
, , , and . For  apps, this produces  matrices — for each metapath
— where the value at index  is the number of paths connecting  with  for that metapath.
Therefore, each row in the matrix is the feature vector for an app with the number of metapaths between it and
all other apps in the training set. Each matrix then forms a kernel for a support vector machine and with multi-
kernel learning they were able to achieve performances ranging from a  F1-score to  with the multi-
kernel model.
Android HIV
In this paper, the authors, Chen et al., introduce a framework for attacking malware detection models,
specifically the MamaDroid and Drebin systems. T o perform this, they modified two adversarial attack
algorithms: a modified Carlini and W agner (C&W) attack and a modified Jacobian Saliency Map Attack (JSMA).
These modified algorithms were used to generate perturbations that were added into the features of apps so
that they were misclassified as benign all while keeping the apps as functional examples of malware. With these
methods, they were able to reduce the performance of both the MamaDroid and Drebin malware from detection
rates of more than  to . In our project, we adapt their methods in order to attack the HinDroid system
and our model.
METHODOLOGY
In this section, first, we will describe the details of our proposed model, m2vDroid, and then we will describe the
method we used to attack the models in the Adversarial Attack section.
m2vDroid
m2vDroid is another malware detection model that we implemented that is largely based off HinDroid. However
it uses node embeddings for the final vector representations of apps instead of the bag-of-APIs/commuting
matrix solution that HinDroid applied.

95% 1%Our ETL pipeline begins with Android apps in the form of APK files. These APKs are unpacked using Apktool  to
reveal the contents of the app, but we are primarily concerned with classes.dex , the app's bytecode. W e
decompile the bytecode using Smali  into readable .smali  text files. From here we extract each API call, the
app and method it appears in, and the package it is from. This is done for every API in an app and for every app
in the dataset, forming a table with the information needed for the next step.
HIN Construction
Using the data extracted previously, we construct a heterogeneous information network using the Stellargraph
library. Our HIN contains 4 types of nodes which we define as:
: Android apps determined by name or md5, i.e. com.microsoft.excel  or 
09d347c6f4d7ec11b32083c0268cc570 .
: APIs determined by their smali representation, i.e. Lpackage/Class;->method();V
: the package an API originates from, i.e. Lpackage .
: Methods (or ""functions"") that API calls appear in, i.e. LclassPackage/class/method();V .
The distinct nodes for each type correspond to the distinct values of their column in the API data table described
earlier.  and  share an edge if an  is used within an . Likewise  and  share
an edge if a  contains an .  and  share an edge if an  originates from a 
.
Metapath2vec
To generate our features, we apply the metapath2vec algorithm on the  nodes of our HIN. That is we 1)
perform a random-walk leveraging S tellargraph's MetaPathRandomWalk  algorithm starting from each app. W e
follow designated metapaths to generate a ""corpus"" consisting of nodes in our HIN, then we 2) pass this corpus
into the gensim implementation of the word2vec  model to transform each  into a vector.
After running this ETL on our data, we observed clear clustering after plotting a T SNE transformation of the
vectors we generated. For the most, part it seems that this method is able to distinguish between not only
malware and non-malware, but can also distinguish between different classes of malware to a reasonable extent.
Notably, we have not tested the node2vec or metapath2vec++ algorithms for generating our random walk.Apps

AppExploring the Plot
Looking at this plot, we seem to have multiple clusters of apps. W e wanted to theorize why these clusters might
be occurring so we compiled descriptions of a few types of malware and some possible explanations for why we
see what we see.
BankBot:  a mobile banking trojan that steals banking credentials and payment information, by presenting
an overlay window which looks identical to a bank app’s login page,
RuMMs:  a distributed through SMS phishing, and in some cases initiate transactions by contacting financial
institutions.
Simplelock er: a ransomware that encrypts the users data, which includes a pop up window that requests a
fee to recover data.
Lotoor: a trojan that tries to manage the data on the system and change the settings on the device.
FakeInst:  portrays itself as the real instagram app but will actually send premium SMS text messages once
the user installs it. It evolved into many different variations over the years, so the numerous clusters we see
are likely due to the similar versions of it clustering together.
The two distinct BankBot and RuMMs clusters may be explained by them both targeting banking data, as
RuMMs initiates transactions and BankBot steals a user’s banking information. Rumms and Bankbot are alsoboth considered trojans. Then there is the general malware cluster defined mostly by the apps from the Other
Malware category. What may be contributing to these apps clustering together is that they might share many of
the common APIs used for carrying out general malicious activity such as privilege elevation, data harvesting,
opening pops, or modifying system files.
ADVERSARIAL ATTACK
Our adversarial attack follows many of the techniques applied by Chen, et al. (2018) to attack the MaMaDroid
and Drebin models. T o perform our attack on HinDroid, we followed their Scenerio FB  which allowed access only
to a blackbox representation of a malware classifier and the feature set of this classifier. In this case, we will be
able to query the classifier as we create examples and appropriately add new APIs. The feature set will be the set
of distinct APIs derived from our training apps. In our case, the input vector will be the one-hot-encoded set of
APIs for the example app. T o perform the attack, we modified the constraints of their objective function as such:
where
To explain,  is the objective function trying to find a perturbations, , we can add to
the original example,  so that the model misclassifies the resulting app.  simply ensures that
we work with the discrete values 0 and 1, since the input to our model and HinDroid is a one-hot-encoded
vector for the apps in our dataset. W e also want to ensure that we do not remove any APIs from an app as it
could likely break the app entirely. W e want to avoid this just as the Android HIV authors did. This is covered by 
.
In reality, it wasn't as simple as just changing this function. W orking with the discrete one-hot values will not
work natively with the C&W algorithm as it was originally constructed for continuous values. This made it
straightforward for the Android HIV authors to modify it to work with the probability values, but it does not
directly transfer to our problem. T o solve this, we modified the tanh-trick  used by the C&W attack to optimize
the perturbations. The trick maps the values of the perturbations into an infinite space to make gradient descent
more reliable when boundary constraints are applied (such as limiting the values to be in ). To perform the
mapping, the values are scaled to the input range of the  function or  and then passed through it.
What we did was add a scalar  that scales this function dramatically to make the transition between 0 and 1
approximately instantaneous. This was the key to making the algorithm compatible with our discrete values. Of
course, it was still possible for the perturbations to fall between 0 and 1, so we were sure to perform a validation
step by rounding each example and getting the final output label using the rounded example.

To evaluate our methods we conducted two tests: The first evaluating the performance of HinDroid against
m2vDroid and second evaluating the strength the our adversarial attack.minδ∥δ∥2

λm2vDroid Experiment
To test our models, we used a dataset of 6,451 apps. 5,516 of these apps have been deemed malicious through
other methods. W e will use this as the malware set. For the benign set, we selected 2 categories of apps: popular
apps and random apps. P opular apps were selected from the popular category of apkpure.com , a Android app
marketplace. Random apps were selected at random from the site. While popular apps are unlikely to be
malicious, the same cannot be said for random apps. Some estimates believe that up to 5% of the apps could
contain malware. Nevertheless, we use the apps to bolster the benign app set as not doing so would make the
benign app set negligibly small compared to the malware set. In total, we used 905 apps for the benign set, with
324 popular apps and 581 random apps. Between these apps, there were 6,495,974 distinct API calls, 653,742
packages, and 6,945,506 distinct method declarations.
We then created a training set with one third of the apps, with the remainder becoming the test set, making sure
to keep the proportion of each category of app equal. The result is that the training set had a total of 2,535,703
distinct API calls, 273,241 packages, and 2,674,056 distinct method declarations. With these sets, we will
compare the performance of m2vDroid against 5 of Hindroid's best performing single-kernel models ( , 
, , , ).
m2vDroid Parameters
For the metapath walk, we specified a walk length of 60, walking on each of the following metapaths 3 times per
 node:
    
        
        
            
            
We chose these metapaths as they are similar to the set formed by the 5 single kernel models of HinDroid that
we will be considering.
For word2vec, we used a skip-gram model trained over 10 epochs. W e used a window size of 7 so that 2
connected apps could appear in the window even in the longest metapaths. The min_count  parameter was set
to 0 so that all nodes in the metapath walk were incorporated. W e also were sure to include negative sampling
as part of the process, as negative samples would help further distinguish nodes the are not associated with
each other. For this we specified negative=5  for a final output vector of length 128.
Adversarial Experiment
To test the adversary, we trained a substitute model on the  kernel for HinDroid. Using this model, we
generated examples for 500 apps selected at random from our entire app dataset. W e then took these examples
and their original inputs and ran them through each kernel of the HinDroid classifier. This would help us
determine how well the examples generalize to attacking the other kernels as well as shed insight into the inner
workings of HinDroid itself.AAT

AATAs for the parameters of the attack, we used a lambda of 10000, a confidence of 0.0, a c_range of (0.1, 1e10),
using 5 binary search steps, and max_iter of 1000. W e also set the learning rate to be 0.01. W e initialize the
perturbations in tanh-space randomly setting approximately 5% of these values to 1. T o clarify, this is not
equivalent to randomly adding APIs. W e found that the algorithm never succeeded if we left the perturbations at
0. Adding these small changes gives inertia to the algorithm and was key to generating successful examples.
RESULTS
HinDroid vs m2vDroid
With the final results, we can see that while we still achieved some respectable numbers, m2vDroid struggled to
keep up with the HinDroid kernels' performances and it had a pronounced issue with false positives. This may
simply be the case that m2vDroid is not as effective as HinDroid or that we may need to further tune the
parameters of it. However, considering that some other kernels faced the same issue, albeit with a smaller
magnitude, this may be the result of the heavy bias in our dataset. This could also be due to the inclusion of
random apps. R ecall that a small percentage of these apps may actually be malware but we may have mislabeled
them as benign by assuming all random apps were benign to begin with. It may be worth the effort to perform
the test again by either excluding random apps or filtering possible malware using another method.

After testing the adversarial examples we generated, we were returned the following results. Being that we
trained against the  kernel for the test, it is not surprising we see that that the attack was most successful
against this kernel, achieving an evasion rate of 97.2%. Malware examples were also able to evade the 
and  kernels with a success rate >99%. Malware examples were fairly ineffective when it came to the
 and  kernels. It may be that these kernels are more broad with their definition of malware,
making it harder for the malware examples to evade them. The inverse might be said for the  where
benign examples struggled to evade the classifier. Overall, we believe these results are incredibly promising for
our method and would like to expand them to other kernels as well as our model in the future.

1 Introduction
We are developing a 3D simulation environment representative of rich real world
data to reliably test and simulate robotic agents in dynamic environments. This
work is important because it can help streamline the remote development pro-
cess and help others visually debug and evaluate the components of the robot
they are working on.
To accomplish this we are using the Unity 3D game engine to replicate the
Thunderhill race track and create debugging tools for others to visually evaluate
their algorithms in real world scenarios. We are using the Borregas Ave. Track
in order to run an actual simulation. Additionally, we will use the LGSVL
simulator to virtualize the functionality of common sensors like IMU, GPS,
Odometry, and Lidar devices. Finally, we plan on exploring the feasibility of us-
ing the Autoware.AI framework to assist with localization, detection, prediction
and planning computations of the robot. The reason for choosing Autoware.AI
over Autoware.AUTO is because the other students of our class are all working
with ROS1 and Autoware.AI supports ROS1 while Autoware.AUTO supports
ROS2.
2 Goal
The main goal of this capstone project was to recreate the Thunderhill Race
Track and import it into the LGSVL simulator so that other teams were able
to test out their algorithms that they created for the sensors and cameras that
will be on the robot. The idea behind this was that since it's an autonomous
robot that should be navigating on its own we wanted to make sure that the
algorithms that are responsible for avoiding collisions and keeping the robot
within the track worked properly before racing in the Thunderhill Race track.
Making sure that the robot did not crash while doing a lap in the track was one
of our main priorities since that's what the simulator is for instead of testing it
out in the real track. Our nal goal is to ultimately do laps around the west
side of the Thunderhill tracks which is about 2 miles long as safe and eciently
as possible with the help of the previous steps mentioned beforehand.
13 Abstract
We were able to replicate the ThunderHill race track using the Unity 3D game
engine and integrated Unity with the track and robot into the LGSVL simulator.
Once the integration was complete we were able to see our robot with the
Thunderhill Track as our map in the simulator. We were then able to virtualize
the functions of the IMU, odometry and lidar sensors and RGB-D cameras to
better visualize what our robot perceives in the simulation. Finally we were able
to fully visualize what our robot sees with the virtual sensors using Autoware
Rviz which displays the location and point cloud map of the vehicle and its
surroundings.
4 Methods
In terms of building the Thunderhill Race track we approached this problem in
a variety of ways. One method that we rst tried was to use google maps/earth
API to import the thunderhill track by selecting the coordinates of tracks. While
we were to successfully import the Thunderhill Track using google map API,
the track was blurry even after trying to improve the quality so we opted to try
another method so that we can make this virtual track as realistic as possible.
We were then able to nd some existing data that we used to recreate the track
in Unity which was signicantly better in quality than our rst approach of using
google maps. So we decided to stick with the data that we found since it also
had elevation data which made it even more realistic and looked very similar to
the actual track due to the elevation data. We were able to also further improve
this thunderhill track in unity by using a HD render pipeline that was provided
by Unity and made the pixels less blurry and more to their actual color. In
terms of why we chose to use the LGSVL simulator is due to the fact that it
builds on top of ROS2/AutoWare and mainly because it's compatible with the
Unity 3D engine that we are using when doing the integration between these
two software tools. The methods that we used to create a virtual environment
for our vehicle includes: building a track from unity into the simulator, bridging
a connection between the simulator and Autoware through a port. Finally we
gave the car commands on Autoware using 2D navigation goal and let the car
drive to its destination.
5 Data and.Conversion
In terms of grabbing actual data, we were lucky enough to be given the thunder-
hill data in pcap form by students from another class also studying this course
in unity. Our data that we fed into unity needed to be in the format of a PCD or
point cloud data format. What we had was the thunderhill data in a PCAP le
format which was a binary compression of many PCD les. To get this extrac-
tion, we used an online converter we found that someone had coded. We xed
the code up a little bit and was able to successfully do the conversion. Using the
2PCD data we were able to build thunderhill on unity. However eventually when
exporting thunderhill to an asset bundle we ran into some major issues. This
led us to eventually use Borregas Ave. Track from LGSVL's pre-made tracks
instead. All necessary data was given to Autoware through a shared directory
that the docker container for Autoware mounted to. This included all necessary
launch les.
6 Autoware Setup/Requirements
We found that in order to be able to even run Autoware on a computer, there
must be certain requirements that are met.
•CPU: An i5 is needed at the bare minimum but an i7 is recommended
•Memory: 16GB to 32GB
•Graphics Card: NVIDIA GTX GeForce GPU (980M or higher perfor-
mance)
•SSD: At least 30 GB
•Alternative for GPU: Use an Nvidia Drive
We installed and ran Rviz which is the visualization for Autoware through build
commands in Ubuntu. Using some sample data we created a visualization of
the sample track shown here.
Figure 1: Rviz
37 ThunderHill Track
As we mentioned earlier one of our tasks for this project was to recreate the
Thunderhill track in Unity-3d engine. In addition to using satellite imagery to
generate track data we also were able to nd a DEM(Digital Elevation Model)
from Thunderhill track which shows the elevation data from the track which
was used to help create the track
Figure 2: Digital Elevation Model

 (b) Recreated Thunderhill Track
Figure 3
The portion of the track that we are more focused on is the west side of
Thunderhill which is a 2 mile section of the track and can be seen in the picture
below. We are just focusing on the west side of the track for the simulator
because the racing competition only race in the west side and we want to make
sure that the robot knows how to autonomously navigate the west side of the
track as best as possible
4Figure 4: West Thunderhill
8 Robot
The robot that we used were inspired from the ones they use in F1 car races but
in smaller dimensions. The robot that we are using is a smaller version of the
dimensions of the F1 cars that they use in car races. Some of the main hard-
ware that is mounted on the robot consists of a LIDAR sensor, IMU, odometry,
RGB-D cameras, power board, Nvidia Jetson Tx2 computer(CPU/GPU) along
with other hardware that make up the robot.

59 Simulation
We selected to use the LGSVL Simulator to pair with autoware. Even though
we eventually didn't get to use an asset bundle of thunderhill, we still had to
build the simulator from source in order to prep for the thunderhill asset bun-
dle. There were many package requirements for building the simulator. This
include git LFS, node.js, unity version 2019.3.15. The procedure for building
the simulator was to install unity hub, install the unity version 2019.3.15 with
windows support dependency if you're on linux. Then clone the 2020.06 version
of the simulator from the lgsvl github: LGSVL simulator 2020.06 version. This
is extremely important as the wrong version will get you an asset bundle out
of date error. Open the simulator as a project in unity and build the WEBUI.
Then you are good to build the simulator. Open the simulator after its done
building and in a web browser link the information for the vehicles and map,
create a simulation and select the vehicle and map. Then run the simulation
and it should pop up on the LGSVL simulator program.
10 Autoware and LGSVL
Autoware and LGSVL connects through a port. We provided a bridge connec-
tion for the 2 through LGSVL's bridge connection where we inputted the local
ip of the machine at port 9090. Then we connected them through activating
the launch le for sensing on Autoware. This allows for the simulator to be
connected to Autoware. Now any actions in the simulator will be reected on
Autoware and vice versa. In order to verify the two are connected, you must see
that the bridge status on the simulator shows as connected. With this we began
2d pose estimating as well as 2d navigation. After launching rviz, we used 2D
pose estimate in order to calibrate the starting position of the car. This was
done by drawing an arrow from the current spot of the vehicle through where it
was facing. Then after turning on mission and motion planning in Autoware, we
were able to set a 2d navigation goal for the vehicle to head to. An interesting
observation we found was that the arrow needed to be in lane with the vehicle
currently. Also due the the localization the car's appearance on autoware was
very vague causing it to spin around and miss-localize.

11 ROS Stack Algorithms Used
Navigation Stack
11.1 Mapping
- already imported using Autoware however if we are making a fully autonomous
vehicle we need to have a map; we can do this by utilizing g-mapping to create
a 2-d occupancy grid map; from laser and pose data from the Lidar/RGB-D
camera
11.2 Localization
- The navigation stack utilizes AMCL or Monte Carlo Localization - AMCL
utilizes particle lters in order to nd out where the robot is currently located
This predicts position and orientation as it moves and senses the environment
(localization)
711.3 Path Planning
- Handled by the move base package in ROS - Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm in
order to determine the shortest path from current position to destination
11.4 Obstacle Avoidance
- Utilizes Lidar/camera data and 2D - occupancy grid map in order to determine
where the obstacles are - If there is an Obstacle then we will create a new path
using the move-base package
11.5 Autonomous Navigation
- Utilizes particle ltering, SLAM or Simultaneous localization and mapping
Helps in using Odometry values and TF values to nd a path for the robot to
move
11.6 Localization utilizing GPS
- Utilize GPS API calls in order to get current location coordinates of the robot
after obtaining these current location coordinates we can then publish this data
to a Odometry node the navigation stack will subscribe to this Odometry node
to obtain the current location of the robot it will then localize the robot on the
map and then we can now plan a path (using move base) for the robot to take
11.7 Autoware Navigation Stack
- Utilizing ROS2 (ROS2 Native Bridge), publishers and subscriber nodes, in
order to publish data to nodes from surrounding and receive data (subscribe)
to nodes for data. - Specically, rst the vehicle establishes localization by
publishing the current Odometry, TF, etc data to the relevant nodes; and then
navigation stack subscribes to these topics so it can utilize algorithms such as
AMCL to establish localization - Because it establishes localization (the stack
knows the current location) it can now create a path from its current position
to its destination utilizing the 2-d occupancy map and Dijkstra's (shortest path
algorithm). Afterwards, it would then publish this data so the robot can obtain
the path/data - In order to do obstacle avoidance the navigation stack constantly
subscribes to the topics necessary to detect obstacles in front of it so it can create
a new path immediately in order to avoid these obstacles

813 Challenges/Debugging for Future Students
The challenges that we faced in the simulator and autoware setup included deal-
ing with a lot of out of dated versions of packages and code from the github
source code itself. This occured with both the simulator and autoware where
we had to re-clone newer version of the data for autoware and the simulator
builder code. This also occured with the autoware data launch les, ultimately
the detection and localization launch les provided by autoware were outdated
so we could not accurately localize and have it detect the movement around the
track. This was an extremely big road block for us.
Other minor issues we faced had to deal with le conversions as well as the sim-
ulator using the wrong graphics card. In order to run the simulator properly, a
Nvidia GPU must be used whether through a nvidia container or a local GPU.
During the debugging process we found that we had to remove mesa drivers/the
intel GPU so that the Nvidia one would be recognized.
A more major issue we ran into towards the end of the project was that the
thunderhill track we created in unity was exporting into an asset bundle cor-
rectly. We have not resolve this issue and we have reached out to community
forums about this issue. This is also the main reason we are using Borregas
Ave. for our demo instead.
The out of date launch les was another unsolvable issue in our project. We at-
tempted to change the computing settings of Autoware however this only make
the localization glitch and did not improve it.
14 Conclusion
The remaining work that we have is to integrate Autoware using the rosbag
le that we receive from converting the pcap le. Following that we are aiming
to successfully get the simulator working so that we can visualize our vehicle
move on the racetrack. Once we have all these previous steps completed then
we will successfully have fully created a tool/pipeline for simulating our robot
in a virtual environment for other teams to test out their code.We will have the
Thunderhill race track generating data for us as the robot navigates through
the virtual track.
15 Appendix
15.1 Project Proposal
Our team was previously working on the Lidar Sensor which is part of the car's
obstacle avoidance/detection sensor. This sensor is in charge of 2D mapping its
surroundings in a 25m radius of itself and reports back any obstacles that the
sensor's laser scanner detects. We will no longer be working on the lidar sensor
part of the robot since we already demonstrated how to integrate the LiDAR
into ROS and will be shifting focus to Autoware virtual track simulator/testing.
9A major part of this will be in the case that we can't test our robot on a similar
track to the F110 and the ThunderHill track due to Covid limitations, we will
have the Autoware simulator as a testing tool. A critical part of autonomous
vehicles is to be able to visualize the robot in \action"" and be able to test all the
components of the robot such as the sensors, cameras, IMU, odometry , etc that
will help navigate the car. Which is why for the second quarter of this project we
will be focusing on creating our current robotics perception and actuators in the
simulator based on real data.creating dierent virtual tracks using AutoWare ,
one of them being the ThunderHill track to simulate how well our robot would
perform in the real track. Using the Autoware simulator will also enable us to
test the other teams cameras and sensors that will give us a good idea of the
eectiveness of the robots navigation and perception system. Due to Autoware
being something new to all of us, our main goal for next quarter will be to learn
the ins and out of Autoware AI simulator and become experts on it so that we
can replicate the ThunderHill and F110 track environment and so that the other
teams can test also test their algorithms and visualize their progress along with
testing all of the parts of the robot.

Abstract
The focus of this paper is on the application of computer vision in mapping, local-
ization and navigation of an autonomous vehicle. Primarily we are dealing with
the problems of
• How to map and localize in an environment where 2D Lidars are not useable
• How to use computer vision to enable navigation in varying light conditions
• How to avoid obstacles and stay within lanes using computer vision
We aim to achieve this using the following methods
• Use of the RTABMAP[1] package which uses Camera, Lidar and Odometry
to map and localize. It uses the depth information from the camera as well
which allows a 3D Lidar view in at least one direction
• Use of the rqt reconﬁgure dynamic GUI to tune camera parameters to reduce
sensitivity to light
• Use of Facebook AI Research’s Detectron2 Deep Learning network[2] to
segment images and detect objects based off captions
11 Introduction
One of the main tools used in autonomous mapping and navigation is a 3D Lidar. A 3D Lidar pro-
vides various advantages. It is not sensitive to light conditions, it can detect color through reﬂective
channels, it has a complete 360 degree view of the environment and does not require any ”learning”
to detect obstacles. One can use the reﬂective channel to detect the color of lanes as well as a regular
2D axis view to avoid obstacles. The pointcloud information from the Lidar can also easily enable
mapping and localization as the vehicle will know where it is at all points. It is easy to see why so
many large scale autonomous vehicle units invest in expensive and bulky Lidars. However, this is
not accessible to all due to it’s price. A camera (even depth) is much more affordable. However it
comes with it’s own slew of disadvantages. It can see color but programming for the color is hard
due to varying light conditions. Unless you use multiple cameras you often can’t see all around you.
These factors together are a hindrance to autonomous mapping and navigation and we thus aim to
resolve it through this paper
2 Environment
To carry out experiments we choose to use our ﬁeld track at UCSD. It provides an environment
where the 2D Lidar sometimes comes in use (through cones) but still cannot completely depend on
the Lidar to navigate safely. There are white lane markings and central yellow lanes that can be used
as a guide. We can also spread cones around to use as obstacles. During the daytime the sunlight
appears heavily on end while being darker on the other side which creates issues in doing even 1 lap
safely in the track. In the night the light conditions are much more stable. But as seen in the image
below there are still areas where the light is strong and other areas where the light is much weaker
Figure 1: Environment for testing
3 Experiment Design
To meet the 3 targets described in the abstract we have set up 3 different experiments:
23.1 Mapping
In SLAM, we are driving the car around to construct a map of the environment while simultaneously
localizing itself relative to the map[3]. For this experiment, we will be generating our own data. This
will be done by controlling a car and have it drive around the track while the car maps and localizes
itself. Previously, we ran this experiment in a simulated environment and it generated 3 different
datasets, the ground truth, the odometry path, and the SLAM path. However, in the real world,
we don’t have a ground truth. So, we will be driving the car on the yellow line of the track as a
substitution. Driving it on the track’s yellow line will improve testing stability and give us more
consistent results. The goal here is to increase the number of greens we see in ﬁgure B. Getting a
green means that the algorithm has successfully found a loop closure and localized itself. Getting a
yellow means that the loop closure has been rejected, but the data is still saved for further analysis
and processing. An example can be seen below
Figure 2: Green and Yellow hypothesis on the track
Driving speed is crucial when running the RTABMAP algorithm. When the car goes too fast or
makes sudden movements, the car will fail to localize itself or detect any loop closures. In ﬁgure A,
there is red ghosting at the bottom square and this is caused by a sudden movement while turning.
In order to ﬁx this issue, we had to drive over the same area. Furthermore, an environment in which
the vehicle can return to a previously visited spot is beneﬁcial because this allows the car to map and
locate new images to older ones. When we mapped in an indoor environment without any set path,
the mapping found very little loop closures. However, when mapping on the track, where we were
able to drive the car in a consistent path, the car is able to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant number of loop closures.
3.2 Light Conditions
The problem we want to address is: how do we ﬁgure out a way for the car to navigate robustly
using computer vision under varying light conditions? When driving the car in the tent, we initially
noticed that the car had some challenges in navigating under sunlight conditions, and realized that
Intel Realsense D455 camera conﬁguration tuning is necessary in order to alleviate the sensitivity
of the camera to such bright conditions. Speciﬁcally, we want to test different camera parameters
(brightness, depth gain, contrast, auto exposure, hue, white balance etc.) dynamically to see which
3conﬁguration setting could best set off the camera’s sensitivity to bright conditions and give us a
similar image layout to the normal, default setting (non-bright conditions).
Our initial idea was to ﬁnd a way to incorporate Intel Realsense software development kit (SDK)
directly to ROS so that we can use the SDK sliders to adjust camera conﬁguration settings. However,
this was quite hard to implement and debug within our workspace. As a more realistic approach,
we integrated Realsense camera settings to a rqt plugin called ‘rqt reconﬁgure’ so that we can easily
view and edit parameters that are accessible with the dynamic reconﬁgure package. With this pack-
age, we are able to use its command line tools to produce a variety of .yaml ﬁles that will be read
in the launch ﬁle to make the data collection process easier and reproducible. After executing the
launch ﬁle, we can simultaneously use this rqt plugin tool and refer to Intel’s tuning guidance[4] to
address our question. Speciﬁc steps to our experiment are as follows.
• Use dynamic reconﬁgure package to tune parameters
• Take several images of the same area with different lighting conditions
• Once data under different conﬁguration settings is collected with the recording procedure,
compare between same images at the same position using the evaluation metric SSIM
• Repeat the process and choose conﬁguration with the best SSIM
Figure 3: rqt reconﬁgure GUI
3.3 Object Segmentation
The experiment design here is relatively simple compared to the previous two.
3.3.1 Data Collection
We run some laps in our track and collect image data. This poses a slight issue in that the images are
collected at 60FPS(frames per second). Meaning we have 60 images of nearly the same moment. In
the Light Conditions section this didn’t pose a problem since we would just record the ﬁrst image
and stop. To combat this issue we diverted the images into to a new ROS topic that published the
images at a throttled down 1FPS. This allowed for a lot more distinct images to be collected that
made the data collection and storage process a lot more efﬁcient
3.3.2 Data Preparation
This image data is then labelled with the help of the MakeSense AI tool[5]. This tool enables annota-
tions in various formats in a precise manner. We used the COCO JSON format to get segmentations
and boundary boxes. The images are then manually split into a train, validation and test data.
43.3.3 Training
We built a repository that is able to take this data and provide us back metrics on how the Detectron2
model performed. This repository allows for several model ﬁles to be provided so that we can run
several experiments at once without constantly monitoring. This enables us to get results back much
more efﬁciently as well. We can run experiments using different base models(Mask RCNN, Faster
RCNN etc), different learning rates, different epochs and different batch sizes. The model which
performs best on the validation dataset is returned. This model is then used to evaluate the test data
as well as return a sample video of all the predictions on the test. Normally a video on test data
would not make sense since each test image would not be sequential. However, in our case, since
the image data for train, validation and test are collected sequentially in laps they tie together as
well. By providing a custom framerate we are able to control the output of the video as well for
legible outputs
4 Dataset
Each of the 3 experiments provide their own dataset which is used in different ways:
4.1 Mapping
Our experiment generated a .db ﬁle which consisted of positional data and image data. Positional
data comes in 2 ﬁles and each ﬁle has the following format:
Column Name Meaning
timestamp Time stamp at which the position was recorded
tx Translational X component position
ty Translational Y component position
tz Translational Z component position
rx Imaginary X component of Quaternion or pitch
ry Imaginary Y component of Quaternion or roll
rz Imaginary Z component of Quaternion or angle of wheels
rw Real W component of Quaternion or yaw
Both datasets will have the same timestamp for each data entry. This means for any given timestamp,
we have 2 points of information on the location of the robot.
Since both datasets are already aligned, we don’t have to do any preprocessing of the data. We will
do a basic sanity test on the data by plotting the positions of each dataset and seeing if the plotted
trajectory of the datasets are similar. An example is shown below:
Figure 4: Plotted trajectory of datasets
5Using RTABMAP’s built-in database, we are able to view image data that was recorded during the
mapping and localization process. Below are two images from our dataset.
Figure 5: Incorrect mapping b/w 2 images
Figure 6: Correct mapping b/w 2 images
In each image data, there are 2 key elements that RTABMAP labels, the ﬁrst is a yellow dot, which
represents a unique key point in that particular image, the second is a blue line, which represents
when RTABMAP is able to match key points between two images. There are two images in every
index of image data, one from an initial mapping and another which is used to compare it with the
old image. In ﬁgure 5, we see that since they are different frames, there are no blue lines. However,
in ﬁgure 6, it was able to match a majority of the yellow points. With this, a loop closure is detected
at the given image data.
4.2 Light Conditions
Our experiment will record and generate a collection of .bag ﬁles, with one image to be exported
from each .bag ﬁle. Since we have previously witnessed that the car navigates robustly under con-
ditions with less sunlight, we will mainly use the image data under default settings (non-bright) as
a standard baseline to be compared with images with other conﬁguration settings under brighter
conditions.

The dataset will be a set of images. Primarily a ROS bag ﬁle containing images from the throttled
down topic we made. We extract the images from the bag ﬁle, label and split into train, validation
and test data. Each of the 3 contains the following information
• A COCO JSON dictionary containing the annotations for each image
• A set of images (whose ﬁle names are included in the JSON dictionary above)
The COCO JSON dictionary (after being read into Detectron2) is formatted as follows
• Images: Contains a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains information on a speciﬁc
image. We have details like the Image ID(used to link with annotations and segmentations
later), File Name, Width and Height for each image
• Annotations: Contains a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains information on a
speciﬁc annotation instance. We have details like the annotation ID, image ID, category
ID, iscrowd (refers to whether we are annotating a single object or a bunch of objects
together. For the purposes of this research paper all our objects are annotated separately
so iscrowd is 0), and segmentation (a list of x,y vertices since our labelling is in polygon
format)
• Categories: Contains a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains information on the
categories our dataset is labelled for. We have details like the category name and category
ID. For the purposes of this experiment we have categories lane and cone. The category ID
is used to reference these category names
A sample image can be viewed below
7Figure 7: Raw training image
The image is a 360 x 1280 image taken from the Research environment mentioned earlier. As
mentioned we can see the white lane and orange cone in the image.
The boundary boxes are generated from a max computation using the list of vertices in segmentation
(basically most extreme at each end). With this we have a clear idea of where the objects are on the
map and can compute the position we should move towards to avoid the objects detected (thus
staying within the lane and avoiding the cones)
5 Evaluation
Each of the 3 experiments have their dataset evaluated in different ways:
5.1 Mapping
We will be using the Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) as our main metric to accurately evaluate our
SLAM algorithm. Below is a visual representation of how the ATE is calculated[6]
Figure 8: Baseline ATE
The path is created through driving around the track multiple times. The blue lines represent what
the algorithm thinks the path is, the black lines represent the ground truth, and the red lines represent
the distance between the black and blue lines
85.1.1 Integration
Figure 9: Transform Tree
Prior to running the RTABMAP algorithm in the real world, we needed to make sure all of our
sensors were working. This includes the lidar, vesc, and RGB-D camera. After making sure that
all sensors are working, we created a launch ﬁle that sends sensor data to RTABMAP for process-
ing. The launch ﬁle included dummy nodes so that the correct transformation tree can be created.
RTABMAP requires that all sensors are under the same transformation tree for any data to be pro-
cessed.
5.2 Light Conditions
The metric we will be using to evaluate the sensitivity of different camera conﬁgurations to lights
is Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). First, MSE is a fundamental
metric that calculates the difference in surface, or pixels of two compared images. SSIM is used as
a metric to measure the similarity between two images at the same position. Structural Similarity
Index between two images is calculated as a value between -1 and +1[7]. A value of +1 indicates
that the 2 images are very similar, while a value of -1 indicates that they are very different[7]. In
our case, we will compute the SSIM between the image under default conﬁguration setting and
image under adjusted conﬁguration settings with brighter conditions (study lamp or phone lights
over camera). The higher the SSIM between the image under default setting and tuned camera
conﬁguration setting, the lower the sensitivity of the camera is.
5.2.1 Why we speciﬁcally chose SSIM:
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) is ﬁt to reﬂect the human visual perception system, which iden-
tiﬁes the differences between the information extracted from two images[8]. SSIM adopts the as-
sumption that the human visual perception system (HVS) is highly adapted for extracting structural
information, and considers image degradations as perceived changes in structural information varia-
tion. Relating this to our case, we can best identify the structural information that changed between
the image under default (non-bright conditions) setting and tuned setting under bright conditions
(lamp, phone light). This quality assessment is a more enhanced form of measurement as compared
9to metrics like mean squared error, which computes error between two images by simply quantify-
ing the difference in the values of each of the corresponding pixels of images. So what makes SSIM
better in quality than other metrics? SSIM extracts 3 key features from an image: 1) luminance 2)
contrast 3) structure[8].
Figure 10: SSIM illustration
Luminance (x;y) =l(x;y) =2xy+C1
2x+2y+C1
Contrast (x;y) =c(x;y) =2xy+C2
2x+2y+C2
Structure (x;y) =s(x;y) =xy+C3
xy+C3
Two images are represented as x and y, with andrepresenting the mean and standard deviation of
the given images. C1,C2, andC3are constants to ensure stability in case the denominator becomes
zero. SSIM score is given as the multiplication of these components with the relative importance of
each metric: ;and
SSIM (x;y) = [l(x;y)][c(x;y)][s(x;y)]
5.3 Object Segmentation
To evaluate the model we choose to use the Average Precision[9] which is the ofﬁcial metric used in
the Microsoft COCO paper as well as the main metric returned by the Detectron2 network. Unlike
SSIM and ATE mentioned earlier, Average Precision is a much more simpler metric that is used
in several classiﬁcation problems. Let’s ﬁrst start with Precision and Recall. The formulas are as
follows
Precision =Number of True Positives
Number of True Positives +Number of False Positives
Recall =Number of True Positives
Number of True Positives +Number of False Negatives
These are simple metrics used in class imbalance problems as it is more revealing than accuracy.
Precision is basically a measure of how much we can trust the model when it says positive (in this
case positive is it classiﬁed an object in our image). Recall on the other hand is a measure of how
good our model is at predicting positives overall. These 2 together share an inverse relationship. If
you have a really high precision your recall tends to fall down. On the other hand a high recall means
your precision will fall down. These 2 together form a curve known as the precision recall curve
which is decreasing in nature. The area under this curve is what we call ”Average Precision”. This is
taken a step further in most research papers such as AP50, AP75 and mAP. In our own paper we use
10mAP. The numbers here (50 and 75) are the thresholds at which we determine what is a true positive
and what is a false positive. When our model classiﬁes an object it comes with a conﬁdence level.
In the case of AP50, anything with a conﬁdence of 50% is considered positive and below negative.
This is then compared to the actual labels to see if it is falsely classiﬁed or not. AP75 follows a
similar principle. mAP is the mean of the average precision curve at all levels of conﬁdence. In the
COCO paper this is 10 splits from 5% to 95%. It also averages the precision across all categories.
This is the most common metric used in papers and is what we will be using to serve as a baseline
comparison for future research
Each model will be evaluated on the above metrics in a certain priority order (inputted into our
repository pipeline). Whichever model performs best is used for ﬁnal inference and video genera-
tion. Once it passes this stage we will shift the model weights to our physical car. This is the ﬁnal
test phase. If our car is able to navigate safely on our track with the help of the model then it means
it was successful and we were able to achieve autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance using
the camera

On seeing the top 5 conﬁgurations
12Figure 13: Top Conﬁgurations SSIM and MSE
Overall, lower levels of parameters were helpful in alleviating light intensity. Luminance, contrast
and structure were appropriately balanced out while exposing the details of the image, which led
to a noticeable rise in SSIM and reduction of pixel difference (MSE) to under 1000. The ﬁve
conﬁgurations were successful in compensating for the loss of content caused by light, especially
on the front left side of the tent that surrounds our track. The best tuned conﬁguration we found
through setting at 3500 (compared to the initial value at 4600), and we got SSIM to reach 0.9245
and MSE down to 49.
The following were the results of the best tuned conﬁguration
13Figure 14: Best Conﬁgurations Image Comparison
On the other hand, the bottom 5 conﬁgurations
Figure 15: Bottom Conﬁgurations SSIM and MSE
Generally higher levels of parameters displayed minor improvements or made things worse, since
the altered images deviated even more from the image with default conﬁgurations (under non-bright
conditions).
146.2.3 Analysis
The top 5 parameters that were useful were: lower white balance, lower contrast, lower sharpness,
lower contrast and lower saturation. Other minor parameter adjustments were used alongside each
of these parameters, but these were the features that brought about dominant alterations to the non-
tuned image under daylight conditions.
Lower white balance improved the results by compensating for the “color cast” imposed by the light
(ground looking light-greenish to slight yellow)[10]. Moderate to low sharpness increased content
and detail of the image while preventing bad artifacts in the image. Lower contrast minimized the
difference in pixel (MSE) by offsetting the image’s liveliness induced by light sensitivity of the
camera. In terms of saturation, the difference in the levels of dominant color hues such as green
(ground) and blue (middle, dotted lines) and remaining hues decreased with low saturation levels,
once that led to shutting off dominant, colored hues that were being emphasized and intensiﬁed due
to light.
Notable parameters that were not useful were: lower/higher hue, high gain, high exposure and high
brightness.
Both lower and higher levels of hue parameter merely led to changes in color, unlike how the contrast
parameter reduced color gradients to set off liveliness of the image. Increasing gain introduced
electronic noise and degradation in depth quality (checked through Realsense Depth camera node),
which also made it difﬁcult for the tuned image to become similar in layout to the default image [4].
6.2.4 Realtime Performance Evaluation
Now that we have found the best tuned conﬁguration that maximizes SSIM and minimizes MSE,
how do we actually determine if this conﬁguration is useful in terms of dynamic movement? The
tuning of Intel D455 camera nodes was done with single, static images since that was the effective
way to solely compare between the effects of parameter adjustments themselves. However, we also
believed that it was important to integrate the viability of our tuned conﬁguration to the car’s entire
runtime, which in our case is one lap around the track.
The dataset we use is the same, as we have already exported images from .bag collections using
the image view ROS package. Instead of selecting a single image to compare with another single
image, we take the whole set of images recorded in one lap.
We evaluate the consistency of our best-tuned conﬁguration’s ability to offset light in realtime by
observing the variability of pure luminescence across the set of images. If this conﬁguration is able
to offset light at one area of the track but does so in a relatively weaker amount in another area of the
track, that demonstrates the variability of pure luminescence. The ultimate goal is to test whether or
not the similarity level between realtime performance of default conﬁguration images (non-bright
conditions) and tuned conﬁguration images (bright conditions) is high.
We measure that by taking RGB color code information using Python’s ImageStat library, in order
to compute the perceived brightness of all images in the set. We then simply calculate the standard
deviation (measures variability) of this numeric ﬁgure to get the realtime performance. The returned
values are shown below:
15Figure 16: Runtime/realtime performance in light sensitivity
As expected, the image dataset with non-tuned conﬁguration (under bright conditions) displayed the
highest value, since images were exposed to different levels of light at different areas of the track. We
found that the realtime performance between default conﬁguration and tuned conﬁguration is highly
similar at 86%, compared to the initial realtime performance between default conﬁguration (non-
bright conditions) and non-tuned conﬁguration (bright conditions) being 69% similar. This showed
that we are 86% conﬁdent in deploying our best-tuned conﬁguration in maintaining a consistent
amount of light that it would offset across the given realtime.
Although our best-tuned conﬁguration demonstrated a noticeable improvement in realtime perfor-
mance across the car’s runtime, the camera was still sensitive to light in certain areas of the track
when the car drove autonomously in bright daylight conditions. This shows that there is still work
that needs to be done to actually allow our camera or car to be more robust to lighting conditions
6.3 Object Segmentation
After experimenting with the hyper parameters we got
Epochs Batch Size Learning Rate Train mAP Validation mAP
100 64 0.02 83.7 81.3
100 16 0.02 84.9 81.8
100 8 0.02 86.3 83.9
200 8 0.02 90.6 79.9
200 8 0.01 89.9 87.4
Our baseline model was that of 100 epochs, batch size of 64 and a learning rate of .02 which was
quickly dropped down due to a scheduler. Since our dataset was quite small we decided to drop
down the batch size for more stochastic weight updates. This worked and we found 8 to be the
optimal batch size. We next aimed to target epochs. However increasing the 200 epochs quickly led
to overﬁtting on the data. We reduced the learning rate to compensate and the performance stabilized
near 90%
This was a surprisingly good performance and when tested on track it provided near perfect infer-
ences for the lane and cone objects
16Using the Detectron2 Framework we can draw the segmentation and even a boundary box around
each object in the image
Figure 17: MaskRCNN Labelled image
However the model itself runs extremely slowly at around 5FPS since the inference takes 200 mil-
liseconds. This required us to drive really slowly to adjust to the latency in predictions
6.3.1 Usage
The inference results were used to generate a white polygon. The white polygon was basically the
area between the lanes and symbolized the areas we are allowed to drive in. The boundary box
vertices of the lanes were used in this calculation since they precisely mapped the endpoints of the
lane segmentation. The segmentation information from the cones was then overlayed. In cases of
overlap between the cones and the white polygon we generated earlier we blacken out that section
of the image. This means we are not allowed to go there
Figure 18: Processed driving image
The centroid of the image is then taken to choose a point to navigate towards in the white region.
This point is converted into a throttle and a steering angle which is sent into our VESC to drive
towards
Here is a ﬂowchart of how this process looks
17Figure 19: Driving ROS Flowchart
Here the /camera/color/image raw and /masks are ROS topics that are used to communicate b/w the
several nodes. We run the Detectron2 MaskRCNN wrapper separately to prevent re-initalizing of
the model constantly
7 Conclusion
Overall we had some successed and some failures in our entire setup. The car was able to localize
well but required a lot of laps to map effectively. Our car is able to drive safely in the track but it
requires extremely slow speeds due to the MaskRCNN model having high enough inference times
to not be usable in real world. The camera tuning was able to reduce the effect of light but not to the
extent that it was reliable to deploy in the real world. Future improvements would be
• Use of additional sensory information and better parameters during mapping
• Use of cheaper models and ofﬂoading model inference to another chip (Like the OpenCV
AI Kit Depth camera)
• Use of domain randomization to reduce the effect of lights

Abstract 
Autonomous navigation requires a wide-range of
engineering expertise and a well-developed
technological architecture in order to operate. The
focus 
of this project and report is to illustrate the significance
of data visualizations and an interactive interface
with 
regards to autonomous navigation in a racing
environment. In order to yield the best results in
an 
autonomous navigation race, the users must be able
to 
understand the behavior of the vehicle when training
navigation models and during the live race. In order
to 
address these concerns, teams working on autonomous
navigation must be able to visualize and interact
with 
the robot. In this report, dif ferent algorithms such
as A* 
search and RR T* (
Rapidly-exploring random tree
) are 
implemented to create path planning and obstacle
avoidance. Visualizations of these respective algorithms 
and a user interface to send/receive commands will
help 
to enhance model testing, debug unexpected behavior , 
and improve upon existing autonomous navigation
models. Simulations with the most optimal navigation
algorithm will also be run to demonstrate the
functionality of the interactive interface. The results, 
implications of the interface, and further improvements
will be discussed in the following sections.
I. Introduction 
An important aspect of path planning and obstacle
avoidance with regards to autonomous driving is
efficient pathing. In order to create the most ef ficient 
path, data must be fed as an input in order to derive
the 
best possible output. Visualizing this output and 
interacting with the robot will help to identify the
most 
desirable path and help the vehicle avoid obstacles
to 
maneuver from point A to point B. This concept can
be 
applied to any moving robot as it will have to avoid
obstacles in order to arrive at the desired destination.
Creating an interactive interface platform that allows
the user to view the vehicle’ s current path and 
navigation sensor information will further help the
vehicle ef ficiently navigate autonomously . In the 
following section, methodology for developing an
interface and ef ficient path navigation will be described 
in further detail. Following the methods section,
this 
report will describe the results and impact of allowing
the user to view real-time vehicle information while
having the ability to control the vehicle.
II. Methods 
Due to the current state of the pandemic, all
autonomous navigation racing platforms have been
pushed back indefinitely . In order to compensate for
the 
lack of of f-line races, simulated racing tracks have
been 
created with the help of students from our domain.
To 
continuously improve and test the ef ficiency of our 
autonomous navigation while avoiding the risks of
the 
pandemic, most components of this methodology will
utilize the Gazebo simulator [1], which will be the
platform that supports the simulated online racing
tracks. The Gazebo simulator is primarily used in 
conjunction with the Linux operating system, and as
a 
result, Linux OS is the desired operating system due
to 
increased compatibility . Other important components
of 
this methodology will include OpenCV  library , Gazebo 
Simulator , RViz, Rosbridge, and many ROS packages.
A frequent bottleneck that may arise is the lack of
compatibility between some Ubuntu Linux versions
with some ROS launch files provided. It must be noted
that Ubuntu version 16.04 and version 18.04 would
work better with version ROS Kinetic and ROS
Melodic respectively . If a dif ferent version of ROS 
were to be installed with another version of Ubuntu,
errors are likely to arise frequently . With this 
information in mind, it should be noted that the
methodology presented will be developed in Ubuntu
version 16.04 and ROS Kinetic.
The primary step taken was to ensure that each
hardware and software components were workingproperly to reflect real-life autonomous navigation.
Data collection and processing was completed using
the 
TurtleBot robot [2], a personal robot kit with
open-source software that supports ROS and more
importantly , ROS Navigation packages. Instead of 
physically using these TurtleBot robots in real-life,
they 
were virtually spawned using the Gazebo simulator , 
which created a workspace to test dif ferent algorithms 
on the TurtleBot robots in dif ferent environments
and 
maps. The TurtleBot uses the Intel Realsense R200 
camera and an LDS-0 360 Laser Distance Sensor as its
default hardware sensors. Because the robot built
for 
real-life autonomous navigation uses the Realsense
D455 camera and a SICK Lidar , the configurations for 
the TurtleBot’ s default camera were changed to the 
Realsense D435 camera and the default lidar to the
Hokuyo Lidar . The objective in these changes is to
help 
decrease the hardware discrepancies between the
Gazebo simulations and our real-life robot.
Once the TurtleBot was properly configured, our group 
was able to spawn the UCSD racing track [3] on the
Gazebo simulator , depicted in
Figur e 1
. This racing 
track accurately reconstructs the of f-line track that
our 
domain used to assess dif ferent path planning 
algorithms before pandemic restrictions were
strengthened. After this setup was completed, our
group 
was able to perform G-Mapping using the TurtleBot.
Figur e 1:
UCSD Racing Track on Gazebo Simulator
G-Mapping [4] uses ROS Navigation and ROS
Perception packages to provide a laser -based 2-D 
occupancy grid map from laser and position data
collected by the robot. To create the grid map using 
G-Mapping on the Gazebo simulator , our group 
launched multiple ROS nodes using “roslaunch.” After 
launching into the UCSD race track map using Gazebo,
we used a keyboard to navigate through the map while
the lidar saves its LaserScan data into rostopics along
with positional data. After scanning through the map, 
our group was able to save this scanned map into a
“.yaml” file which consists of the map’ s meta-data, 
depicted in
Figur e 2
.
Figur e 2:
Visualization of “.yaml” file map meta-data
Using the 2-D occupancy grid map created using
G-Mapping, dif ferent path planning algorithms could 
be implemented to help the TurtleBot navigate 
throughout the race track. Our group implemented two
path-planning algorithms, the first algorithm is a
search-based algorithm called A*. The A* algorithm
is 
a heuristic search to find the shortest path in the
least 
number of computations. Given a starting and end
point, the algorithm is tailored to explore paths
only in 
the direction of the goal. To navigate in the shortest 
path, priority is given to the nodes that have a lower
estimated distance to the end point, which is calculated
using the euclidean distance. The second algorithm
our 
group implemented is a sampling-based algorithm
called RR T*. The RR T* algorithm creates a path by 
building a tree from the starting position of the
robot. 
Different points are sampled from the initial position,
and they are checked for any collisions with obstacles.
If the point does not cause collisions, it is added
to the 
tree with the nearest point as its parent node. This 
process repeats until a path is found from the initial
to 
the destination point.
Using the grid map generated, these theoretical
algorithms generate a /move_base/goal rostopic that
moves the robot from a starting point to an initial
point. 
This process can be computed and visualized in R Viz 
[5], a robot visualizer ROS package. Rviz allows the
move_base rostopic generated to be visualized inside its
own interface. Using ROS nodes, Rviz allows the user
to input a “goal” for the vehicle to autonomously
navigate using the 2D Nav Goal button, depicted in
Figur e 3
. When the user uses the goal button to set
a 
destination point, the robot’ s current location will
be the 
starting point. Once the robot begins moving towards
its given destination, a local and global planner
could 
be seen that visualizes the robot’ s current pathway
and 
final pathway . The local planner (green line) displays 
the current pathway of the robot, and the global planner
(blue line) displays the calculated path generated
from 
the algorithms that the local planner will eventually
follow . A demonstration of the R Viz interface can
be 
found in the hyperlink below:

RRT* and A* algorithms are two common algorithms 
used in the field or robotics for search and navigation,
with the preference skewed towards the former . Our 
group was able to implement these two navigation
algorithms using G-Mapping, and now our group will
try to compare these two algorithms based on dif ferent 
metrics that will determine which algorithm is more
efficient in autonomous navigation.
For precise and direct comparisons, each respective
algorithm was implemented using the Python
programming language [6], where they will be run and
tested against each other to evaluate performance.
Instead of running the navigation algorithms in a
Gazebo or ROS based simulation, each respective
navigation algorithm was run using binary grayscale
mapping or track images. In order to evaluate the
speed
and robustness of each of these algorithms, each
algorithm was tested on a base maze image that is
labeled “maze.png,” depicted in
Figur e 4
.
Figur e 4:
Base image referring to “maze.png”
In
Figur e 5
, the RR T* algorithm is run on the base 
mapping image of “maze.png”. The red nodes refer to 
each node that is created and branched out of the
tree 
starting from the starting point. The green lines 
represent the paths connecting each node that has
been 
branched out since the original starting point. Once
the 
nodes continue to branch, they will iteratively continue
through the map in search of connecting to the
destination node. Once the nodes can be connected
through the RR T* branching method, the blue line 
represents the best path created in the tree based
iterative node connecting process seen in RR T* 
algorithm. In
Figur e 6
, the A* algorithm is run on
the 
base mapping image as well. It should be noted that
this 
image is inverted when computing for the best path.
When loading in the data with CV2 [7] functions, there
were default settings that inevitably inverted the
image; 
this leaves room for improvement in the future to
fix 
the inverted image ef fects of CV2. The yellow aspects 
in
Figur e 6
shows the graph traversal process that
the 
A* algorithm is performing to ultimately connect the
starting node to the destination node. The red line
in the 
respective figure represents the best path that is
created 
after the traversal process has been completed.
Figur e 5:
RRT* algorithm path creation on “maze.png”
Figur e 6:
A* algorithm path creation on “maze.png”
Both RR T* algorithm and A* algorithms were run 10 
times each to determine the average runtime of finding
its best respective path. The results can be found
in the 
following table below referenced as
Figur e 7
. As seen 
in the results, the metrics ultimately decided on
for 
determining the algorithm robustness and performance
were average completion time in seconds given 10
iterations and number of algorithm failures throughout
all 10 iterations. Intuitively , it makes sense to
yield a 
lower completion time to find the best path as that
implies that the algorithm will find the best path
faster .
Additionally , the fewer failures with the algorithm
in a 
given number of runs will mean that the algorithm
is 
more robust and is less likely to run into failures.
As 
can be seen in
Figur e 7
, RRT* algorithm yields better 
results in both of these metric categories. After 
realizing these results, it was determine that RR T*
is 
the better algorithm and was used for further testing
in 
navigating the Thunderhill mapped track through 
simulations.
Further visualizations and the integration process of
such visualizations using RR T* algorithm will be 
discussed further in the following results section.

Metrics for algorithm performance
In this report, our group’ s main objective is to test 
different path planning algorithms that would be
efficient for racing in dif ferent environments. To
fully 
incorporate this idea, we must be able to visualize
what 
path the vehicle is currently taking, and determine
what 
algorithm is best suited for each dif ferent racetrack.
In 
order to make these kinds of decisions, we need to
implement a user -oriented interface, that will allow
the 
user to monitor the ef ficient paths that these dif ferent 
algorithms generate via visualization, and allow the
user to control the robot through this interface.
To bring this theoretical process into action, we
implemented an interactive interface using Rosbridge
[8], which is a package that provides a JSON API that 
will implement ROS functionalities to programs
(web-browser) that does not normally process
ROS-related programs. Using HTML  [9] and Javascript 
[10], we will create a web-browser that will connect
to 
the Rosbridge servers to allow interactive usage for
users, depicted in
Figur e 8.
This interactive interface 
can subscribe to rostopics that will take input data
from 
the robot’ s different sensors, as well as allow the
user to 
input specific destination coordinates to start
autonomous navigation using the dif ferent path 
planning algorithms. The interface will also include
the 
python visualized navigation algorithms that will
show 
the calculated path plans in real-time on the webpage.
The web-browser will allow the user to monitor the
vehicle’ s status, similar to the dashboard of a car .
Figur e 8:
Interactive interface using Rosbridge
III. Results 
Building an interactive interface is crucial, because
it 
allows the user to monitor the vehicle’ s current path
as 
well as sensory information that will be useful for
determining if the autonomous navigation algorithm
chosen is ef ficiently transporting the robot from
one 
location to another .  As mentioned previously in the 
methods section, our group implemented R Viz, which 
was able to visualize the vehicle autonomously
navigating with the help of the 2-D grid map created
from G-Mapping and the path planning algorithms such
as A* and RR T*.
Although R Viz is visually appealing and shows the 
local and global planners that allow the user to view
what the robot’ s current path is using the path planning 
algorithms, it lacks support in visualizing sensory
information such as the vehicle’ s current position, 
speed, odometry , IMU, and even battery life. Also, 
RViz may be dif ficult for users to navigate around, 
because it requires understanding certain rostopics
to 
view certain data such as images from the Realsense
depth camera. The user would have to add dif ferent 
rostopics with several clicks inside R Viz, which may 
cause confusion.
In order to allow the user to ef fortlessly understand 
what path planning algorithms are being utilized and
also be able to view dif ferent sensory information
that
the autonomous vehicle is outputting, the interactive
interface using Rosbridge was created. The interactive 
interface implemented will also allow the user to
move 
the vehicle from its initial position to the final
destination by pressing the “Submit” button, as long
as 
the user knows the final position coordinates. In
case 
the user does not know the final position coordinates,
the interface will provide the track’ s finish line 
coordinates, which the user can obtain by pressing
“Preset Value” that is installed in the interface
to 
autonomously navigate the vehicle. A demonstration
of 
the Interactive interface can be found in the hyperlinks
below:
Interactive Interface (Preset Value)
Interactive Interface  (Input Value)
Our group was able to utilize ROS node commands
such as rostopic echo and rostopic info to understand
how dif ferent navigation sensors could be displayed
in 
the interface, depicted in
Figur e 9
. For example,
we 
used the above commands to understand that the
/move_base/goal topic generated from the autonomous
path planning algorithms could directly move the
vehicle from its initial position to the final position.
Using HTML  and Javascript, our group was able to 
create the interface without the user having to search
through ROS nodes to receive sensory information
outputted by the vehicle. By creating a web-browser
that allows the user to control and view the robot
in 
real-time, the user will understand how the vehicle
is 
thinking, and if the path planning algorithm selected
is 
efficient in the dif ferent race track characteristics.
Figur e 9:
Rostopic info and echo demonstration
As mentioned previously in the methods section, RR T* 
algorithm was determined to be the better navigation
algorithm for finding the most ef ficient path given
the 
start and end points on a binary grayscale image.
It 
must also be noted that previously RR T* was tested
on 
a binary masked grayscale image that resembled the
makeup of a maze. Nevertheless, the main application
in which RR T* is being applied to is a race. The 
specific race being catered to is an autonomous
navigation race at the Thunderhill track. Therefore,
our 
tuned RR T* algorithm must be tested against track
like 
settings, and once deemed satisfactory , the RR T* 
algorithm will be tested against a masked grayscale
image of the real two mile Thunderhill track [1 1].
A test_track.PNG is generated, which can be seen in
the 
outline in
Figur e 9.
This track illustrates more 
curvatures and changes in outline that is dif ferent
from 
that of
Figur e 4
. These changes in a mapping setting 
would represent dif ferent challenges for the search
and 
navigation algorithm as it would have to find the
most 
optimal path. In
Figur e 9
, it can be seen that the
RRT* 
algorithm has found its most optimal path from one
designated point to the other .
Although the blue line representing the best path
may 
seem jagged and seem to run of f course, the line is
the 
best possible path because of potential delay of
computing power associated with the necessary
calculations to find the best path. It also occurs
that the 
node creation process branches out to find the best
direction, and coincidentally , the path seems to be 
jagged. This RR T* algorithm also runs relatively fast 
and as a result of the node branching out process,
the 
jagged behavior in the path creation occurs. It should
be 
noted that that if RR T* runs through longer iterations, 
the path will curve out to be more smooth and less
jagged behavior will be seen. Nevertheless, the path
outputted is still the best path for RR T* to navigate 
from the start point to the end point.
Figur e 9:
Python visualization of RR T* algorithm on 
“test_track.PNG”
After confirming that RR T* works on a map-like binary 
grayscale setting, the base image for the Thunderhill 
track was created from the Thunderhill track website. 
As seen in
Figur e 10
, the image represents the basic 
layout of the two mile Thunderhill track. This image
or 
figure may also be referred to as
“thunderhill_cropped.PNG”. As previously mentioned, 
the track data was taken from the Thunderhill website 
and converted into a binary masked grayscale image,
which is the output seen in
Figur e 10
. In this respective 
figure, the starting line had also been masked and
can 
be seen as a black bar on the track on the top center -left 
corner of the image. After this masked grayscale image 
of the Thunderhill track is successfully created,
the 
RRT* algorithm can be applied to this masked
environment.
Figur e 10:
Binary masked grayscale image of the two 
mile Thunderhill track (“thunderhill_cropped.PNG”)
In
Figur e 11
, the entire Python bird’ s eye point of view 
visualization of the RR T* algorithm on the 
“thunderhill_cropped.PNG” is visualized. Similar to
previous figures, the red dots refer to the nodes
of the 
tree branches that traverse from the original node
(starting point) to the destination node (end point).
The 
green lines refer to the connections between nodes,
and 
the blue line represents the final best path that
connects 
the original node to the destination node. This line 
ultimately represents the path that the autonomous
vehicle will follow on the Thunderhill track.
Figur e 11:
Python visualization of RR T* algorithm
on 
“thunderhill_cropped.PNG”.
A demonstration of the python visualizer can be found
in the hyperlink below:
Python Visualizer
This RR T* visualization is intended to mer ge with
the 
interactive interface. As a result, the visualizations
that 
are outputted will serve as a useful tool for the
user to 
identify how the autonomous vehicle is deciding its
path and how it eventually navigates. Watching the 
node creations will inform the user of the thought
process of the navigation, and thus inform the user
how 
the car will behave. Following the blue line will
allow 
the user to visualize and understand how the car moves
and decide if the path currently navigating is correct
according to human intuitions. By producing a real-time
image of how the algorithm is creating the most
efficient pathway , it allows the user to better understand 
the entire autonomous navigation behavior process.
The significance of these visualizations and the
interface is that the user will be able to monitor the
autonomous vehicle and make decisions accordingly . 
Racing performance and debugging capabilities can
be 
significantly enhanced as a result. For instance,
if RR T* 
algorithm seems to be outputting abnormal pathing,
the 
users monitoring the interface could have control
and 
change the navigation algorithm to another navigation
algorithm such as A* in the hopes of improving path 
planning and obstacle avoidance.
IV. Discussion 
The main objective of this report is to show the
progress that is being made to eventually allow our
domain to autonomously race in dif ferent events such 
as F1T enth [12] and Thuderhill. In order to successfully 
compete against dif ferent participants, our group’ s
main 
goal is determine the most ef ficient algorithm for
racing 
in these dif ferent tracks. By using our interactive 
interface, the user will be able to view path planning
algorithm behavior as well as real-time sensory
information outputted by the vehicle during navigation.
Currently , the interactive interface shows sensory 
information from the TurtleBot spawned inside the 
Gazebo simulation. These include the vehicle’ s current 
speed, position and RGB image. The interface is also 
subscribed to the /move_base_simple/goal ROS node
that is generated from the path planning algorithms
that 
help the vehicle to navigate autonomously . By clicking 
a single button, the user will be able to navigate
the 
vehicle to the intended destination. In addition to
all 
these features, the interface also displays the current
path planning algorithm generating the most ef ficient 
path given a specific racetrack.
Future improvements to the interactive interface
currently include optimizing visualizations to be
more 
clear , subscribe to more nodes to receive more input 
data, and test potential latency with lar ger datasets
or 
streams of data. Currently , several plots and tools
on the 
interactive interface contain data that is self generated
on a small scale, often referred to as ‘dummy data’.
Future ambitions include implementing the interface
with more advanced datasets and streams of live input
data.
V. Conclusion 
In this report, our group successfully integrated
navigation hardware into the TurtleBot that directly 
reflects the real-life robots built, as well as
implemented the UCSD racing track inside the Gazebo
simulator that mirrors the real-life track. G-Mapping
was correctly implemented to create a 2-D grid map
that was the basis for implementing path planning
algorithms in the Gazebo Simulator such as A* and 
RRT*. The performance of these algorithms were tested 
based on dif ferent metrics, and these algorithms were 
able to visualize their performance on real map images
of the real-life racetracks that have been postponed
due 
to the on-going pandemic. Our main objective was to
implement an interactive interface that will allow
the 
user to control the vehicle and view significant sensory
information obtained from the vehicle during
autonomous navigation, and this was achieved by
displaying dif ferent real-time sensory data, creating
a 
platform for the user to monitor the path planning
algorithms, and thus allowing the user to autonomously
navigate the vehicle with ease.

Abstract
Self-driving vehicles are revolutionizing the automotive industry with companies like Tesla, Toyota, Audi
and many more pouring a substantial amount of money into research and development. While many of these
self-driving systems use a combination of cameras, lidars, and radars for local perception and navigation,
the fundamental global localization system that they use relies upon a GPS. The challenge in building a
navigation system around a GPS derives from the inherent issues of the sensor itself. In general, GPS's tend
to suer from issues of signal interference that lead to infrequent positional updates and lower precision.
On the 1/5th car scale, positional inaccuracies are magnied, so it is crucial that we know the location of
our vehicle with speed and precision. In this project, we compare the performance of dierent GPS's in
order to determine what level of performance is best suited at the 1/5th scale. Using the best-suited GPS,
we design a navigation system that can mitigate the shortcomings of the GPS and provide both a reliable
autonomous vehicle.

1 Problem
1.1 Challenges of GPS Navigation
Our team's project in the context of our domain is
to build an autonomous GPS-based navigation sys-
tem for a 1/5th scale vehicle that will be robust and
reliable enough to be competitive in a race. The
challenge in doing so primarily comes down to un-
derstanding the shortcomings of the GPS being used
so that its problems can be mitigated through sup-
plementary methods. In addition to the dierences
in accuracy between GPS products at dierent price
points, GPS's in general tend to suer from issues of
signal interference which lead to delays in position-
ing updates and lack of precision as well as oscillat-
ing data even when left at a xed position. To build
a navigation system for a vehicle that will travel at
high speeds, it is crucial that vehicle positioning is
provided accurately and quickly. The hurdle for our
project, then, is to create a reliable navigation sys-
tem using GPS that can update instantaneously and
precisely despite these being the characteristic issues
that plague the GPS.
1.2 Goals
In order to complete our main goal, we created
several smaller tasks to complete over two quarters.
These subtasks can be roughly categorized into GPS
quality testing, sensor fusion, and waypoint naviga-
tion. Finding a GPS accurate enough was crucial as a
navigation system built on a faulty GPS can only be
so reliable. To do this, we rst tested the quality of a
lower-end GPS|u-blox NEO-M8N|and developed
the methods needed for benchmarking GPS perfor-
mance. Once we proved the necessity of a higher-end
and more accurate GPS, we proceeded to benchmark
the performance of the aforementioned GPS to test if
it is truly a better t for our project. Even with more
accurate GPS sensors, there are still a few shortcom-
ings that are unavoidable, such as slower frequency
of messages, and lack of orientation data. To over-
come these shortcomings we fuse the sensor data of
GPS, IMU, and odometry together in order to get a
more accurate localization system. Once we can pro-
vide reliable data to our race vehicle of its current
position, speed, and orientation, we can move on to
the nal subtask of waypoint navigation. The main
challenges in this area are determining the waypoints
needed for the vehicle to eectively and eciently
navigate around a track at varying speeds along with
designing the algorithm to control steering and throt-tle to navigate to those waypoints.
Creating an autonomous navigation system that is
only reliant on GPS is essentially the same thing as
driving blindfolded. While it is important to have
other systems in place to determine both the posi-
tion of the vehicle locally as well as the position of
any nearby obstacles, we will be focusing on the core
ideas behind a system that is primarily reliant on a
GPS. The full navigation stack will contain a global
path for the vehicle to navigate around a track with
zeros obstacles and perfect accuracy. While this path
can be computed independently of the vehicle on the
track, the fully integrated navigation system will also
need a local trajectory system that will use sensors
such as cameras and lidars to make sure that the vehi-
cle both stays on the track and avoids any collisions.
It is evident that our sub project requires a lot of
expertise in areas beyond GPS, so it is important for
our team to collaborate with the teams working on
IMU and path planning as we build GPS-based navi-
gation. We will need to integrate our work with every
other teams' in order to create the full autonomous
race vehicle.
2 Methods
2.1 GPS Comparison: NEO-M8N vs.
ZED-F9P
In order to compare the performance of the u-blox
NEO-M8N that we tested last quarter against the
u-blox ZED-F9P that we received this quarter, we
replicated the testing procedures we previously de-
signed on the new GPS. So, again, we have chosen the
Circular Error Probable (CEP) and 2D Root Mean
Square (2DRMS) to be the evaluation metric used to
compare these two GPS units.
Besides allowing an ease of comparison between our
previous and current work, CEP and 2DRMS are also
good measures of accuracy when it comes to eval-
uating the performance of a stationary GPS. CEP
represents the accuracy radius from a ground truth
coordinate 50% of the time and 2DRMS is an accu-
racy radius for 95-98% of the time. Since we do not
have the equipment to ascertain the ground truth, we
will be using an average of all the coordinates as our
ground truth. We chose to use the mean of our data
as a substitute for the ground truth because the mean
of a sampling distribution (the collected GPS coor-
dinates) should be able to represent the population
mean (the true coordinate).
To compare the NEO-M8N with the ZED-F9P, we
Data Science Capstone 22 METHODS
reused the data we collected on NEO-M8N last quar-
ter and collected ZED-F9P data by leaving in a sta-
tionary position for approximately one hour at a rate
of 4 Hz, or 4 coordinates per second. We chose to test
the ZED-F9P in two dierent location types for this
| in a neighborhood and in a park. This serves to
gauge the accuracy within a setting that has obstacles
which can cause signal interference, such as buildings,
compared to that of an unobstructed and open area
respectively. Since it is a well documented problem
that the environment around a GPS can drastically
aect its performance, testing the ZED-F9P in mul-
tiple locations will give a clear picture of its overall
limitations.
2.2 Sensor Fusion
In order to navigate with a GPS, an accurate vehi-
cle position and direction are needed at all times. By
integrating odometry, IMU, and GPS data together,
we can overcome the weaknesses of each individual
method to obtain a position and orientation that is
overall more accurate. To accomplish this task, we
used an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that takes in
the positional information from the GPS, the accel-
eration and orientation data from the IMU, and the
velocity measurements from our odometry and IMU.
EKF is a state estimation algorithm that consists of a
prediction step and an update step that measures the
actual state. Estimates for the new current state of
the vehicle are improved with the previous estimate
and previous measured actual state and this contin-
ues in a cycle until the uncertainty between predicted
state and actual state converges to zero. Using an
Extended Kalman Filter allows us to lter out noisy
readings from odometry, IMU, and GPS and providesus with an estimate of the current vehicle location
more accurately than these three sensors can provide
on their own. In addition to ltering out the noise,
the EKF allows us to directly combine the three sep-
arate data streams into a single source that contains
both an accurate position and orientation.
2.3 Navigation
Navigation between a series of waypoints is the
concluding subtask of our project which allows us to
tie into the overall goal of creating an autonomous
racing vehicle. For an autonomous system that is
based purely on GPS, the rst requirement is to ob-
tain a detailed map of the desired track to race on.
This navigation map is a binary masked image where
white indicates allowable driving area and black rep-
resents non-drivable areas. For the Thunderhill Race-
way track in Willows, CA we obtained high resolution
satellite images that served as a basis for a navigation
map. From this satellite image, a combination of both
automatic and manual image processing techniques
can be used to create the nal binary mask. Once
a mask is created, it is possible to implement navi-
gation algorithms that will generate a feasible path
for the vehicle. In order to test the vehicle's capabil-
ities, we also created a map of the UCSD tent track
in Warren Mall.
The navigation stack can be divided into three
components: path planning, waypoint determination,
and waypoint navigation. The main goal of the path
planning step is to generate a viable map for a ve-
hicle to utilize given a provided map. Our primary
objective was to test the GPS's eect on navigation
methods, so a path was generated by logging vehi-
cle position as it was manually controlled. One of
Figure 1: Thunderhill Raceway Satellite Image and Navigation Map
Data Science Capstone 32 METHODS
Figure 2: UCSD Warren Mall track map with Global path and waypoints
the major challenges in waypoint determination lies
in the noisy nature of a GPS. Even if the vehicle
reaches the exact position of the waypoint, the local-
ization output may not match the waypoint coordi-
nates, which could result in the vehicle going o-track
or even turning around. To circumvent this issue, we
set a buer radius from the waypoint coordinate such
that if the distance between the current vehicle po-
sition and waypoint is within this radius, the vehicle
is considered to have reached the waypoint and can
head towards the next. Figure 3 shows the over-
all concept of the buer radius. The buer radius is
based on the calculated CEP/2DRMS of the GPS in
use as well as the distance between consecutive way-
points in a generated path. If the generated path
has waypoints that are 0.1 meters apart with a buer
radius of 0.2 meters, then the vehicle may end up
skipping waypoints.
To determine if a waypoint has been reached, we
rst determine a lookahead point, a waypoint that is
k waypoints ahead, for each waypoint. We also calcu-
late distance between the current vehicle position and
lookahead point, distance between current waypoint
and lookahead point, and distance between current
vehicle position and current waypoint. If the distance
between current vehicle position and lookahead posi-
tion is greater than the distance between current way-
point and lookahead point, then the vehicle has not
reached the current waypoint yet. The vehicle should
continue heading towards this waypoint and should
continuously update the distance between its current
position and the waypoint to determine if it is within
the buer radius. Once it is within the buer radius,
the vehicle has reached the waypoint and can start at
step 1 again for the next waypoint. This algorithm
continues until all waypoints have been reached. Fig-
Figure 3: Diagram of buer radius
ure 4 contains an overview of the algorithm.
Once there is a reliable method for the vehicle to
determine if it should still head towards waypoint X
or if it should now head towards waypoint X+1, au-
tonomous navigation can be simplied into determin-
ing steering angle and velocity values to send to the
vehicle. When waypoint X has been reached, a new
steering angle should be calculated so that the vehicle
can point towards waypoint X+1 and can now, theo-
retically, just travel down the path between waypoint
X and waypoint X+1 to reach waypoint X+1. We do
a simple check to see if the current vehicle heading
is the same as the upcoming waypoint's orientation.
If they are equal, there is no need to change the cur-
rent steering angle, otherwise, we use a PD controller
Data Science Capstone 43 RESULTS
Figure 4: Waypoint Determination Algorithms and Distances Algorithm
to determine the steering angle for the car based on
the heading it needs to go to. This steering angle is
continuously updated based on the current position
of the vehicle in relation to the upcoming waypoint.
In order to test both our navigation system and our
calculations for how the GPS noise aects navigation,
we created a Gazebo simulation environment of the
UCSD Warren Mall track. By testing in simulation,
we were able to generate a vehicle with the necessary
sensors and kinematics that allowed us to evaluate
overall performance of the system. Furthermore, the
Gazebo environment allows for the customization of
the amount of noise of the GPS sensor, so in essence
we were able to change the CEP of the GPS being
used on the test vehicle. By changing the CEP of
the GPS, it was possible to directly observe how a
xed navigation system's performance changes based
on the accuracy of the localization sensors.
3 Results
3.1 NEO-M8N vs ZED-F9P
Testing the ZED-F9P in two dierent locations
yielded two very dierent results. From our previ-
ous research we knew that the NEO-M8N had a CEP
of approximately 1.532 m and a 2DRMS of approx-
imately 3.710 m. The results are shown as the rst
gure in Figure 5 . When tested within a neigh-
borhood that had obstructions such as buildings, the
result was that the ZED-F9P had a CEP of approxi-
mately 3.548 m and a 2DRMS of approximately 9.050
m. The results are shown as the third gure in Fig-
ure 5 . The results were erratic, most likely due tothe strength of the GPS signal being interfered by
the tall buildings. Thus, the graph of the results look
visually dierent compared to the other two. On the
other hand, when tested in an open space that em-
ulates our race tracks more accurately, the results
were drastically dierent with the ZED-F9P report-
ing with a CEP of only approximately 0.097 m and
a 2DRMS of approximately 0.233 m. The results are
shown as the second gure in Figure 5 . This is a
huge dierence from the performance in the neigh-
borhood with a 189% dierence in CEP and 190%
dierence in 2DRMS. Comparing the better perform-
ing (open area) CEP to our old NEO-M8N, we nd
a 176.648% dierence in CEP and a 177.151% dier-
ence in 2DRMS.
3.2 Sensor Fusion
To test if we can get accurate vehicle positioning
and orientation, we simulated odometry and IMU
data and introduced noise into the y-axis specically.
Each of the red arrows in Figure 6 is a reading of
the vehicle's positioning and orientation as the vehi-
cle remains in a stationary point. As designed, the
readings are erratic along the y-axis even though the
vehicle has not moved. The blue arrow is the noisy
odometry and IMU data after it has been ltered by
EKF. Although it is hard to tell, there are actually
multiple blue arrows stacked on top of each other as
EKF lters out each noisy reading (the red arrows) to
produce a consistent vehicle positioning. Compared
to the raw odometry and IMU data, EKF ltered
data is much more accurate to the vehicle's position-
ing in both the x and y direction.

While we were unable to test the navigation sys-
tem on nalized hardware due to integration issues,
simulated tests of the vehicle proved to be successful.
Over the course of a full lap around the simulated
UCSD Warren track, the EKF algorithm was able to
reduce the error in localization error essentially down
to zero. Figure 8 demonstrates how the simulated
noise aects the predicted location of the vehicle. The
purple sphere indicates possible locations for the car;
thus the NEO-M8N sphere is much larger than the
ZED-F9P.
3.3 Navigation
Utilizing the waypoint selection and navigation al-
gorithms outlined above, the simulated vehicle was
able to successfully navigate paths generated by the
manually controlled vehicle. Testing in this way dras-
tically reduced the need to run comprehensive tests
of all conceivable paths, because we directly limited
the test space to that of possible paths of the real ve-

hicle. Provided that there are no obstacles, the path
that is provided is guaranteed to be feasible, and the
localization data adheres to the specications that
we benchmarked, the GPS based navigation system
that we created will successfully navigate to every
point supplied. For a demonstration of our vehicle
completing a lap autonomously, please go to: https:

4 Discussion and Analysis
Through our statistical and visual analysis, we
are able to arrive at the conclusion that the perfor-
mance of the ZED-F9P would be much more eec-
tive for autonomous navigation than the NEO-M8N
at the 1/10th and 1/5th vehicle scale. The CEP and
2DRMS of the NEO-M8N were around 1.5 and 3.7
meters respectively, which indicates that it would not
be able to adequately identify what position the vehi-
cle was at | it wouldn't be able to identify which side
of the track it is on and could even possibly report
that the car is o the road altogether. On the other
Data Science Capstone 65 FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
Figure 8: Left: Simulated noise indicating relative position for NEO-M8N
Right: Simulated noise indicating relative position for ZED-F9P
hand, the ZED-F9P had a CEP and 2DRMS of 0.09
and 0.23 meters respectively. One of the most impor-
tant parameters for autonomous racing/navigation is
being able to accurately determine which side of the
track the vehicle is on, so our analysis on the accuracy
of the ZED-F9P indicates that it would be sucient.
It should be noted that the ZED-F9P did not per-
form particularly well in areas with obstructions such
as buildings, however, we can deem this as negligible
for our purposes since the Thunderhill track does not
have obstructions which cause satellite interference.
While our localization system using the EKF was
very eective in simulation with simulated noise for
the required sensors, the same performance was not
achieved with the physical IMU and GPS. The pri-
mary benet of using an IMU was to obtain a head-
ing and provide local corrections to the GPS; how-
ever, inadequate mounting of the IMU resulted in
inconsistent readings of the linear acceleration data.
Because the noise being outputted from the IMU was
not uniform or even Gaussian the EKF was unable to
provide accurate predictions and actually resulted in
worse performance than the GPS alone. The UCSD
track is a fairly inconsistent environment with large
tents and buildings surrounding the track on all sides,
so relying solely on GPS for localization would likely
result in poor navigation performance. However, on
the Thunderhill track, it is likely that even without
the improvements provided by an IMU, the ZED-F9P
would provide adequate localization accuracy for suc-
cessful navigation.5 Future Improvements
One potential path to improving our project is to
use a 2 unit RTK rather than just 1 unit as this could
also potentially increase accuracy while having less of
a computational cost on the vehicle than other meth-
ods of improving accuracy. Our team initially made
some headway on this topic during the course of our
project but due to many challenges with connectiv-
ity and lack of customer support, we were unable to
deliver solid results. Nonetheless, it is a path worth
looking into for GPS-based autonomous navigation if
we were to enter our vehicle for competitions.
Another idea to improve accuracy is utilizing dif-
ferent state estimation algorithms such as the Un-
scented Kalman Filter (UKF) for sensor fusion. EKF
uses a single point, the average of all the coordinates,
to approximate where the vehicle's position truly is
and UKF uses multiple, weighted points to approxi-
mate. The idea is that the more points are used, the
more precise the approximation will be. So, theoret-
ically, the UKF can provide us with a more precise
estimate of the true vehicle position than the EKF
can. However, precision also comes at a cost as UKF
is more computationally intensive than EKF. In our
project, we chose to use EKF as we are designing au-
tonomous navigation for cars on the 1/5th scale trav-
elling on full size lanes so there is more leeway with
not having the most accurate localization than there
is for full-sized cars. However, if this project was to
be expanded for full-sized cars, it may make sense to
prioritize localization accuracy over computing costs.
Lastly, in our current project, we design au-
Data Science Capstone 76 CONCLUSION
tonomous navigation in the context of racing; the goal
is to complete a lap as fast as possible. However, as
self-driving cars become more prevalent in the auto-
motive industry settings, designing autonomous navi-
gation to be applicable in urban trac settings would
have a larger and more signicant impact. To do so,
one of the most important areas we would have to im-
prove on would be to include safety guards for speed.
Since the context of our problem was rooted in race-
track settings, we did not design any safety features
such as reducing the speed when making turns to
prevent accidents from happening. Thus, to help our
current project be applicable in more general settings
like urban trac and for full-sized cars, we would
need to do more work regarding the speed thresholds
we allow our vehicle to travel at, and improve local-
ization accuracy via GPS selection and sensor fusion
to design a safe autonomous driving experience for
humans.
6 Conclusion
To conclude, in order to create a GPS-based au-
tonomous vehicle at the 1/5th scale, it is necessary
to use the ZED-F9P or module with a comparable
CEP. We have been able to successfully have our vehi-
cle navigate through any predened sets of waypoints
based solely o the localization of the GPS, IMU, and
odometry. Although we succeeded with our team-
specic task, it is still imperative to integrate our
work with other groups who are working on aspects
such as computer vision/obstacle avoidance to create
a well-rounded autonomous vehicle that can handle
scenarios that a navigation system built around GPS
can not. While we as a class did not end up integrat-
ing all our work to build one robust race vehicle, our
team-specic work is capable of completing full laps
around a racetrack and can be a starting point for
future work towards integration.

February 5, 2021
When building systems for autonomous vehicle racing and driving, it is critical for
the robot to localize itself within the environment it is navigating. Robot localization
comprises of the robot being able to derive its current path and its heading for future
motion estimation. Popular approaches often involve using GPS data solely and com-
puter vision sensing. However, relying heavily on GPS coordinates or LiDar in open
outdoor environments can lead to several issues. GPS is prone to lag and may be infea-
sible in harsher and unfamiliar terrain, resulting in loss of accuracy in tracking by failing
to produce necessary positional information. Computer Vision approaches often depend
heavily on training data and cannot always provide continouos and accurate orientation.
Our problem investigates using IMU and Odometry sensors to aid in this mission by
providing relevant data, position estimates, and vehicle heading in cases when GPS and
other mapping are not reliable, or to supplement these approaches. IMU (Inertial Mea-
surement Unit) provides linear acceleration, angular velocity, and magnetic force sensing
ability through the use of accelorometers, gyroscopes, and occasionally magnetometers.
Wheel Odometry also provide useful measurements to estimate the position of the car
through the use of the wheel's circumference and rotations per second. Together, these
sensors provide relevant and invaluable data that can be fused to obtain a primary head-
ing and position estimate for the robot. Furthermore, these sensors can be fused with
navigation and obstacle avoidance systems already in place to build more robust and
accurate autonomous navigation models [4].

12 Odometry
2.1 Introduction
Odometry is the use of motion sensors to estimate change over time [1]. To do this,
odometry requires the time, rotation per minute and steering angle. After this, we can
calculate odometry by doing:
Position =OldPosition +V elocity Time + 1=2Acceleration Time2(1)
Using this equation, the robot car can predict where it's location respective to it's
last position. The goal of odometry is to get a estimate of where the robot has driven
to respect to its starting point. This can be problematic alone as over time it may
accumulate errors since it is an estimate of the car's position [6].
2.2 Data Gathering
For odometry, the baseline framework we used was F110th Ackermann Steering [5].
When using this framework, we gathered data from our robot car and cleaned it so we
only got time, estimated x and estimated y. Using these predicted positions, we were
able to localize the robot and see what was its pathing.
2.3 Calibrating Odometry
To increase the accuracy of our odometry readings, tuning has to be done on the
VESC.yaml le to account both the steering and angle gain used in our equations. The
equations being used are:
erpm (electrical rpm) = speed to erpm gain * speed (meters / second) + speed to
erpm oset
servo value (0 to 1) = steering angle to servo gain * steering angle (radians) + steering
angle to servo oset
2.3.1 ERPM Calibration
For the ERPM, we tried to nd the best value for speed to erpm gain, which was only
obtainable by constantly tuning and testing the value. To do this tuning, we took a tape
measure and extended it by around two feet, put our car's back wheels at zero meters
and drive straight. After driving straight, we can grab the distance by doing rostopic
echo /vesc/odom/pose/pose/position/x. After this, if we got a distance that overshot,
2we decreased the speed to ERPM gain and if it undershot, we would increase the speed
to ERPM gain. After testing the values of 4412, 4912, 5412, 3912, 3412, and 4012, we
found that 4112 was the most accurate value with around a 0.0007 error from the actual
position versus a 0.480117 ,0.118568, -0.178206, -042677, and -0.619709 error.

2.3.2 MushR Steering Angle Calibration
For this part, we followed a guide from MushR [10].To test the steering angle to servo
gain, we had to also have a tape measure and see the best value by running the car over
and over. We had a tape measure go out to around 2.5m, then had set the back wheels
to the beginning of the tape measure in a direction that makes it a T shape. To calculate
what we needed as our arc, we needed to do
2R=L=2sin(beta) (2)
and
beta=arctan (1=2tan(delta )) (3)
given that our cars length is 0.475 and the maximum steering is 0.34. This ends
up being around 2.44m. To do this test, we had to change the steering to erpm gain
variable. The values had to be negative because if we set a positive steering to erpm
gain, it would invert the turn. During our rst tuning, we tried to do 0 however, we
learned that if we set zero, it would not turn at all. During the test, our original value
was 0.67 however we had to retune. This was because even though during our test it hit
2.44m, we realized that when graphing it with a constant speed, it would never hit that
amount. Because of this, we decided to make our our tuning test.
Figure 8: start
 Figure 9: mid
4Figure 10: end result
2.3.3 Improved Steering Angle Calibration
After nding that the MushR tuning test was not accurate for our needs, we decided
to make our own test that uses our maximum distance value of 1.8m. For this test, we
would turn the car each time and see how close it plots to 1.8m. To do this, we tried a
steering to erpm gain of -0.5, which made over a full circle when we only did a half circle,
showing that it was too much of a steering angle. After this, we through to increase
the steering angle to -0.7 which preformed a little better but still made a full circle. We
tried increasing it again to 0.8 servo to erpm gain to see how the change aects the circle
because at the time, we did not know what caused it to run a full circle when we only
ran a half circle. Our nal try before researching more was 0.9 servo to erpm gain. Our
nal try before researching more was 0.9 servo to erpm gain.
After seeing that it was not giving the right predicted values, we decided to look into
the le that predicts the odometry values. By going into the vesc to odom topic, we
were able to nd that the equation to calculate the odometry value is:
(data - steering to servo oset ) / steering to servo gain current angular velocity =
currentspeed * tan(current steering angle) / wheelbase
5After reading the equation and testing values, we realized that the steering to servo
gain directly changes the odometry prediction we would get. This means that if we
increased the gain, it would start predicting a larger value and if we decreased the gain
it would decrease the predicted value. Knowing this, we started changing our values
again to try to perfect our odometry prediction.
For our second batch of tests, we tried starting with a -1.0 steering to erpm gain.
When we did this we saw that it was close to half a circle however we wanted to ensure
that by changing this servo to erpm gain to over -1, we would be getting closer to our
intended half circle. Next, we tried a more extreme value of -10 and saw it only did
a small arc, proving that by decreasing the servo to erpm gain we were decreasing the
predicted arc value. Since we have proven the extremes of the erpm to servo gain values,
we started honing into the right servo to erpm gain value. We tried -1.5 next however
it still made too small of an arc. After this, we went changed the value to an erpm to
servo gain of -1.2 which was very close however just shy of the amount we wanted the
arc to be. The nal value we tested was -1.1, which after testing gave an arc with only
a 0.05m error.
Figure 11:
6Figure 12:
2.4 Odometry Discussion/Results
The biggest issue we started with is that there was a problem with the directories of how
we set our vesc le. During that time, we set the erpm to servo gain however it never
changed the value when checking the erpm to servo gain parameter. To x this issue,
we had to go into forums such as the F110th and Mushr Slack and forums and ask for
assistance. After discussing with them further, we found that how we set our directories
was incorrect and it was not reading the vesc.yaml properly. We xed how the VESC
was reading the vesc.yaml and after that, we were able to test the erpm to servo gain.
Our rst issue we started encountered was doing the steering angle tuning test and
completing a 2.44m turn with a -0.67 servo to erpm gain gain. We considered this to be
our nal value and to validate, we started recording the predicted x and y values and
graphing them to see if our tuning test was accurate. However, when we graphed the
robot's pathing using the ERPM gain, we found that the odometry values overpredicted
by double, showing a full circle pathing when we only drove half a circle. Because of
this, we tried doing other values similar to out however we saw the same result mostly,
showing that it drove half a circle. To try to understand this issue better, we went
directly into the VESC node and looked at the equation used to calculate the odometry
values and we found that based on the servo to erpm gain, if you decrease it even more,
it will predict a smaller value, giving us a smaller arc.
Because of this, we had to retune the steering angle however since we made previous
human errors, we used a constant speed of 1m/s rather than an unbounded speed. The
problem however was that since our speed was bounded at 1m/s, we would never hit
2.44ms turning so we decided to tweak the test and make our own. For this new test,
we wanted to make it so the distance we are trying to predict is 1.8m instead of using
the kinematic model equation and tune based on that value. After this, we had to retest
multiple new values such as -1.0 and -10 to prove our theory of the arc and half circle
increasing and decreasing based on the servo to erpm gain. After proving our theory
through testing, we decided to start honing in on the most accurate servo to erpm gain.
Next we tried -1.5 which under predicted and then -1.2 which was only -0.1 o. Our
nal value was -1.1 with a -0.05 error.
3 Artemis IMU
3.1 Introduction
IMU or Inertial Measurement Unit allows for the sensing of acceleration, angular velocity,
and magnetic elds in all X,Y,Z axes. This is accomplished through acceloremeter,
gyroscope, and magnetometer sensors built in within the IMU. Using these measurements
Roll, Pitch, Yaw can be derived by a combination approach of all 3 sensors onboard the
IMU, which allows us to gain an understanding of the robot's relative position. This
7is accomplished through its acceleration and angular velocity measurements, and its
relative orientation by the yaw compass heading. Thus, it will be important to calibrate
and thoroughly verify our IMU produces accurate readings and derived estimates [2].
Initially, due to our previous tests and seamless integration, we had decided to utilize
the Sparkfun 9DoF Razor IMU for the robot. However, the Razor became an obsolete
model and was no longer available to purchase. So, starting in January 2021 we decided
to switch to using the Sparkfun OpenLog Artemis IMU (Dev-16832)[9], the most recent
IMU from Sparkfun lineup. This IMU boasted an enhanced sensing capabilities and
a simple plug and play system, but this was not the case initially. Driver installation
problems with Linux, Arduino IDE issues, and extremely dicult to nd ROS package
were a few obstacles faced when interfacing with this specic IMU. While the Razor
had a strong community supported ROS package, the Artemis did not. After a lot
of digging and contacting those in the eld, we were able to contact Fabrice Le Bars,
who is an Assistant professor in the Robotics Topic Group at ENSTA Bretagne, Lab-
STICC/CID/PRASYS. Through his help, we discovered his personally written ROS
package, where he recently added support for the Artemis IMU. We also went through
the a tedious back and forth process in debugging his personal visual library that was
necessary to visualize the heading derived by the IMU. We then helped to point out
bugs and recommendations for his ocial github repository to better the experience for
future users. The installation and setup guide we have written is attached to this report
and can also help future members of this capstone, Triton AI, and Artemis IMU users
in this process. Thus, we were successfully able to calibrate and acquire the heading of
the IMU which can aid in the navigation and localization of the robot. Thankfully, we
were still able to attend in person lab during the COVID pandemic and have contact
with the robot, which was crucial for debugging many of these steps.
It is also imperative to determine the placement and design of the IMU mount for
both 1/10 and 1/5 car. Further analysis on basic mounts is included below. To design
this mount we must take into account the magnetic distortions previously discussed and
security of the mount itself. Then, we must nd a suitable location on the car that is
safe and ideally furthest from the most magnetized metals of the car. We also had major
issues when trying to replicate integration steps directly on the JNX. This struggles
came from the Arduino IDE unable to properly handle arm64 architecture tools needed
to ash the AHRS software to the Artemis IMU. Ideally we can have all installation steps
done using the JNX. Currently we are using external machine (best case running Ubuntu
20.04) to ash the software and calibrate the IMU, per the recommendation of Dusty
Franklin from Nvidia and various Arduino and Jetson forums. To further mitigate the
noise of the IMU, calibration procedure should be done even with the slightest changes
in IMU positioning and robot modications.
3.2 Calibration
Calibrating the Artemis IMU had to completed methodically and with care to establish
reliability of its measurements. This process was similar to the Razor IMU we had worked
with before, so we knew where to avoid common pitfalls. To calibrate the Artemis IMU,
we made sure to follow a dened procedure by the Fabrice Le Bars ROS package [3][4].
This allowed us to congure a calibration le to calculate the nal osets and calibration
parameters and easily integrate with our IMU with ROS. For the calibration of the linear
acceleration in the x,y,z axes the Artemis IMU, we needed to obtain the maximum and
minimum acceptable values of each axis by pointing the IMU upwards and downwards
in each axis to a position expected when the IMU was to be mounted on the robot. It
was imperative to reset the measurement if there were mishaps as the sensor proved to
be quite sensitive, which could greatly aect the readings in future. To calibrate the
gyroscope, the IMU was kept still on a at surface for 10-15 seconds to account for
the noise at rest. Calibrating the magnetometer proved to be trickier to handle due to
8external magnetic inuences in our workspace. The magnetometer can be inuenced by
""Hard"" and ""Soft"" iron osets which can distort the magnetic forces around the IMU. We
experienced a hard iron oset initially which can be seen in the gure below. However,
after clearing the workspace of large metal objects and potentially magnetized metals,
we were able to achieve satisfactory calibration.
Figure 13: ""Hard"" Iron Oset
In order to test whether the reliability of the measurements, we devised to collect
data under the following set of conditions (which followed in the Heading validation as
well). The IMU was kept at in the x, y plane and rotated about the z axis 3 times in
30 seconds. 500 data points were collected during this process. Under these conditions
we expect the linear acceleration in the x and y axis to be negligible (around 0). The
acceleration in the z axis will be around 9 :8m=s2due to force of gravity, but will be
removed from further consideration because our vehicle will be traveling in the x,y plane
on the ground.
Figure 14:
Figure 15:
Examining the the x-acceleration values from the test over time reveals that they
are fairly noisy with many uctuations, but this is expected from the accelerometer.
Additionally, they lie close to 0 with a max of 0.998 , min of 0.095 , and variance
of 0.034. The distribution plot also conrm that the values hover near 0 and do not
vary greatly. These ndings satises our expectations and indicates that the calibration
process was successful in the linear x-axis acceleration.
9Figure 16:
 Figure 17:
The y-acceleration values exhibit similar properties to the x-acceleration values. The
readings over time remain near 0 for the entire duration of the trial. The values are
noisier than the x-acceleration, but not to an alarming level. The distribution of the y-
acceleration demonstrates values that are mainly centered around 0 with a few negative
outliers. Overall, both the X and Y acceleration values indicate positive results that the
calibration for the linear acceleration was successful and provides reliable readings.
3.3 Initial Heading within ROS
Deriving the heading of the robot is critical in our robot's navigation system, especially in
environments when GPS localization may be error prone and unreliable. The IMU sensor
is cornerstone for obtaining the heading of our autonomous vehicle as its measurements
allow for greatest accuracy in nding orientation. The following equations dene the
derivation for the Roll, Pitch, and Yaw. Yaw is the most important in providing us with
a heading.
pitch = 180 atan2(accelX; sqrt (accelY accelY +accelZ accelZ ))=PI (4)
roll= 180 atan2(accelY; sqrt (accelX accelX +accelZ accelZ ))=PI; (5)
mag x=magReadX cos(pitch )+magReadY sin(roll)sin(pitch )+magReadZ cos(roll)sin(pitch )
(6)
mag y=magReadY cos(roll) magReadZ sin(roll) (7)
yaw= 180 atan2( mag y; mag x)=MPI; (8)
The benet of the using the Artemis ROS package is the inclusion of the Attitude
Heading Reference System that is at the core of library. This allows us to derive ori-
entation for the robot using the acceleration, gyroscope, and magnetometer readings in
unison. This is unique compared to other rmwares and orientation systems that lack
in ability to correct heading estimations using the compass (magnetometer) readings.
The orientation is given in quaternions, which are four dimensional [x,w,y,z] coordinates,
dening a vector and rotational transformation. The heading we aim to use for the robot
10is the Yaw, or rotation about the z-axis (measured in degrees). Thus it is important to
convert the quaternion values to Yaw. Fortunately, ROS provides a method for convert-
ing within its transformations library (tf.euler from quaternion). We have also written a
custom publisher for the yaw value to make this data easily accessible to potential con-
sumers and publishes on the /yaw topic. The yaw data analyzed was collected from our
custom publisher. Continuing under the previously noted conditions to test reliability of
measurements (x, y plane constant and 3 rotation about z-axis in 30 second time-frame),
we can determine whether our heading reading is reliable and accurate.
Figure 18: accel+gyro
 Figure 19: accel+gyro+mag
Examining the Yaw readings over the full 30 second duration shows promising results.
There are three peaks at 180 degrees and three corresponding troughs at -180 degrees.
The sharp jumps are due to the degree system used to measure Yaw, which goes from
0 to 180 degrees, and then from -180 degrees back to 0 (where North is indicated at
90 degrees). This is exactly what we hoped to expect as these values match exactly to
the three full rotations we completed about the z-axis. The Yaw heading captured this
activity accurately and robustly!
We then added an additional test under the same conditions, but instead of 3 rotations
about the z-axis, we did 2 rotations clockwise, paused, and then 2 rotations counter-
clockwise. As the above plot shows, this activity is accurately captured as well as there
are two peaks and falls (at 180 and -180 degrees), a plateau corresponding to the pause,
and then two peaks and falls rising and falling in the opposite direction (at -180 and 180
degrees). This further proves the ability of our heading estimation!
In summary to obtain the heading (Yaw), users can rst extract quaternions from
geometry msgs/Quaternion from sensor msgs/Imu published by the /imu topic, and then
convert to Yaw. Or they can directly acquire the Yaw heading by subscribing to our
custom written /yaw topic. Furthermore, our heading estimation is reliable, accurate,
and ready to be used in our robot localization and navigation system.

4 ROS JNX Integration Workaround
To ease the process of setting up the IMU to our Jetson NX, we had hoped to have all
modules and installation completely functional on the Jetson itself. The AHRS software
11that is integral to the OLA Artemis working must be ashed through the Arduino IDE.
This is because it is written in an Arduino le format. However downloading the Arduino
IDE, necessary board denitions, and build tools on the Jetson's ARM64-architecture
proved to be dicult. We rst tried to circumvent the usual approach in downloading
the Arduino IDE itself and utilized the specic download from Jetson Hacks. While we
were able to establish a connection to the IMU through this Arduino IDE installation,
we were not able to successfully install the necessary build tools and Sparkfun Redboard
Artemis board denition. After searching on many Arduino and Jetson forums, we
were eventually able to install the required board denition by the help at the following
link: https://github.com/sparkfun/ArduinoBoards/pull/62. By including the specied
toolchain in the build json le, we were able to successfully compile the sketch. However,
we were not able to successfully upload the software to the IMU and are still looking
into how to x this error. Our current workaround is to rst ash the AHRS software to
the OLA Artemis IMU using an external machine (tested running Ubuntu 20.04). This
allowed us to successfully upload the appropriate software and establish ROS connection
to the IMU. The ultimate result is that the software must be ashed from an external
machine and therefore, the calibration must also be done while connected to an external
machine. As long as the IMU is as close as possible to its mounted position or running
environment, this process has not yielded any major errors in our verication analysis of
heading. The guide developed in installing and setting up the OLA Artemis IMU with
ROS covers this process further.
5 Heading Real Environment Analysis
Integrating the IMU to the 1/10 car allowed us to verify and adjust our calibration
and helped us discover new insights regarding Yaw Heading error in a real environ-
ment. When setting up our experiment, we utilized re-calibrated settings in the new
environment based on our previous best accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer
Yaw calibration parameters. We then tested these under the following situations and
conditions we controlled during our Odometry positioning tests on the robot.
5.1 Straight Line Heading Test
We rst tested the reliability of the heading in the following case, by driving the robot
strictly straight 2 meters at 90 degrees (West) for 10 seconds. The IMU was mounted
at, traveling only in the x,y plane. By testing three dierent parameter settings for
calibration, we were able to determine the most accurate heading performance. The
three calibrations consisted of: accelerometer + gyroscope calibration, accelerometer
+ gyroscope + mangetometer calibration, and accelerometer + gyroscope + extended
magnetometer (for better handling iron osets) calibration. The specic calibration
parameters per each setting are available in the attached documents. After converting
the orientation quaternions to Yaw (degrees) as before within ROS, we were able to
analyze the heading in a real time setting under the three described conditions.
12Figure 21: accel+gyro
 Figure 22: accel+gyro+mag
Figure 23: accel+gyro+extended mag
Analyzing the Yaw readings against each other from all three test calibration condi-
tions over the the full 10 second interval of strictly driving 90 degrees (West) revealed
interesting ndings. For comparison, readings (blue) were placed against a theoretical
""perfect"" heading of 90 degrees (red) throughout the 10 interval.
The accelerometer and gyroscope calibration condition produced the highest average
error, 90.98, in the straight line yaw test overall. It also had the most striking behavior
as the result of the drift apparent in the readings. This can be seen as the values slowly
decrease from 85 degrees to 70 degrees in only 10 seconds, and in the high variance. Since
the car traveled on a strict straight path, this can be attributed magnetic forces present
in the real time integration that drew inuences from the nearby motors, processors, and
hardware.
The accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer calibration condition performed
the second best in this test with an average error 19.29. Here, the drift apparent in
the previous readings was minimized, which can be seen as the readings are fairly stable
throughout the 10 seconds with a mean of 70.34 degrees and a low variance. The error was
primarily due to a consistent oset which was most likely produced by a hard iron oset
present in the environment that was not accounted for by the standard magnetometer
calibration.
13Finally, the accelerometer, gyroscope, and extended magnetometer calibration con-
dition performed the best with minimal average error of 0.14. This was expected as this
wholly utilizes the calibration capabilities available to us. The average of the readings
was 90.56 degrees and the behavior stable throughout the 10 second interval. This gives
us condence that we are able to account for the hard iron osets and stronger mag-
netic inuences produced by the motors, processor, and other hardware in our real time
environment using the extended magnetometer calibration technique.
5.2 Half Arc Heading Test
Next, we tested the reliability of the heading in the following case, by driving the robot
in a 180 degree arc at a constant speed and turning angle for 10 seconds. The IMU was
mounted at in the x,y plan akin to the ""second"" mounting procedure in the Mounting
section. The same three sets of calibration conditions were utilized from the previous
straight line test. After converting the quaternion values through ROS, we were able to
analyze the heading.
Figure 24: accel+gyro
Figure 25: accel+gyro+mag
Figure 26: accel+gyro+extended mag
Examining the Yaw readings against all three calibration values in the Half Arc Test
revealed to us insights into our calibration performance during turning. For comparison
the robot was driven 180 degree half arc turn (West to East, 90 to 270 degrees) in 10
seconds at a constant speed and turning angle.
14Similar to the straight line test, the accel+gyro calibration performed the poorest
and allowed for largest variance in the readings, with an error 94.89 when compared to
a theoretical increase from 90 to 270 degrees in 10 seconds. There is also random noise
and drift that begins to occur towards the end of the test and the heading never crosses
170 degrees, even though the robot ends its test at 270 degrees. This demonstrates that
the magnetometer calibration is crucial.
The accel+gyro+mag calibration condition performed the next best in the Half Arc
Test with an error of 42.5 when compared to a theoretical increase from 90 to 270
degrees. There was less drift and noise in the readings which can be accounted by the
magnetometer calibration. However, the readings indicate that the heading readings
overshot the actual half arc by about 180 degrees and settled around 350 degrees. This
is unacceptable level of error to utilize this calibration condition in our integration.
Lastly, the accel+gyro+extended magnetometer calibration performed the best with
an error 15.07 when compared to a theoretical increase from 90 to 270 degrees in 10
seconds. The heading was also tracked in a smooth fashion with less noise and drift than
the previous conditions. This was what we had hoped for and demonstrated how the
magnetic presence has a strong eect when not calibrated for using the full capabilities of
the calibration procedure. The extended magnetometer calibration technique allows us
to condently handle the noise and magnetic distortions with a reliable mounting setup.
It is cornerstone to note that the noise is heavily dependent on the mounting position.
We used the second mounting setup described in the following section for these tests,
yet the noise can further be mitigated with an advanced mounting setup.
6 IMU Mounting and Analysis
The mount and mounting procedure to be used for the IMU is crucial in achieving the
highest accuracy readings from the IMU. Insecure or unstable mounting positions can
cause uneven external pressures to be applied to the IMU board. This can cause large
errors in the IMU readings as it is extremely sensitive to even slight uctuations in its
placed environment. The propagation of these errors can greatly deviate or ruin the
derived heading and position estimates. The initial mount we attempted to use was a
temporary x but revealed to us the severity of the errors that can directly be produced
by insucient mounting procedure. We naively used a ziptie and double sided electrical
tape as our rst mount to simply test movement with the IMU onboard the robot.
Figure 27: Simple Mount
15Figure 28: Simple Mount Lin. Accel
 Figure 29: Simple Mount Yaw
This caused the following drift and error in the linear acceleration and the Yaw
heading readings. This can be seen in the average -1.24 m=s2bias in the linear x
acceleration and the small bias present in the y acceleration. The large variation at the
ending of was due to IMU shifting during the run due to this mount being not secure
enough. The Yaw heading readings slowly began to increase and drift over time in this
mounting position as is apparent in the rst up until 30 seconds. This was most likely
due to the constant applied pressure and tilt being applied to the Artemis IMU in this
mounting position. The shifting during the drive caused a massive change in the Yaw
heading and demonstrated how strongly the secureness of the mount can change the
readings. Overall, this mounting position was not secure, allowing the IMU to move and
sway as the robot traveled its course, corrupting the measurements.
Figure 30: Second Mount
Figure 31: Second Mount
16Figure 32: Second Mount Lin. Accel
Figure 33: Second Mount Yaw
Next, we more securely fastened the IMU to the Jetson NX mount through its upper
right mounting hole. This placement was not the ideal case, however it.allowed us to get
more stable data readings that we used during our calibration process. In this position,
the IMU was securely kept in the x, y plane. This removed the previous large bias we
witnessed in the linear y acceleration. There is still small bias however, but it is less than
0.8 in both acceleration axes, which is normal. The Yaw values are also extremely close to
0 (North) throughout the run, with small acceptable uctuations 0.5 degrees. It is still
important to note, the mount still allowed some sway around the z axis, causing some
uctuations and noise in Yaw heading readings in a few runs over time. Furthermore, the
magnetic inuences by being directly next to the Jetson could amplify the accumulation
of error.
The ideal mount would keep the IMU secure in the x,y plane, not apply uneven
pressure, not allow for any sway or movement, and be furthest from magnetic inuences
such as the Jetson, motors, and VESC. With the help of the TAs, a mount was designed to
meet these needs for the 1/5 robot. This mount will ensure the IMU is evenly secured and
will be placed away from other magnetized hardware. We believe this mount will allow
us to provide the most accurate and reliable IMU data, and will be integrating/testing
soon. Testing dierent mounting strategies allowed us to gain insight in how critical the
mount was in inuencing the IMU readings and key factors to mitigate these corruptions.
Figure 34: 1/5 Car Mount
7 Kalman Filter
To fuse our Odometry and IMU sensor reading to provide a better position estimate, a
common and accepted approach from research and literature is to apply Kalman Filtering
[3]. Kalman Filters are used to obtain the best estimate of states (position in our case)
through the combination of measurements from various sensors in order to mitigate noise
[7]. The robot-localization package in ROS provides an implementation of an Extended
Kalman Filter that has popular support and can be integrated into our navigation system.
17For implementation, the Kalman Filter requires a covariance matrix based on the known
or estimated variances in the sensors to be used. Furthermore, the Kalman Filter requires
the setting of a conguration matrix per sensor that determines which readings to input.
These readings are given in the following order of: X, Y, Z, Roll, Pitch, Yaw, X vel, Y
vel , Z vel, ang vel. Roll, ang vel. Pitch, ang vel. Yaw, accel X /dieresis.ts1, accel Y /dieresis.ts1, and accel
Z/dieresis.ts1. We utilized the default settings that were recommended by the community, setting
the Odometry to input default covariance values 0.025 and readings from the pose.x and
pose.y estimates. The IMU was also set to input default covariance values 0.050 and
readings from the linear acceleration x, linear acceleration y, yaw, and yaw velocity.
Figure 35: 1/5 Car Mount
When running our half arc test of Odometry, we found that the Extended Kalman
Filter suprisingly performed slightly worse than our pure Odometry position estimate
(ignoring the error at the end due to moving the car beyond the set time interval).
This was seen as an oset in the x and y position due to initial drift. We believe this
could be due to noise apparent in the IMU linear acceleration which retains a slight
bias no matter how meticulous the calibration process due to the nature of the sensor's
extreme sensitivity. Additionally, the lack of a global ground truth position that would
be provided by the GPS. When the GPS team fuses the sensors, their implementation
would allow them to correct for the noise with greater accuracy due to the presence of
the GPS readings. The current solution is to simply disregard the linear accleration in
the EKF as they result in high accumulation of drift error and solely utilizing the IMU
for the Yaw and Yaw velocity inputs into the EKF. Further work is to explore options in
compensating for this noise and potentially the use of multiple IMUs to mitigate these
errors stemming from slight bias in the readings.
8 IMU Signal Noise Reduction Strategies
In order to further compensate and mitigate the noise in the IMU readings to provide
more accurate data, we utilized a few signal processing techniques. Through our research,
we found that popular approaches for handling noise in a signal were by employing
frequency lters to the data. One such lter is the Low Pass Filter, which reduces high
frequency noise in a signal by attenuating frequencies above a certain cuto frequency.
We implemented a Low Pass Filter in Python at a cuto frequency of 75 Hz.
18Figure 36: Low-Pass Filter
Another such lter is the Median Filter. This lter is applied to smoothen a signal
by converting data points to the median of its neighbors across a ""sliding window"" of
determined size. We then implemented a Median Filter of kernel window size of 5 data
points to convolve our signal with.
Figure 37: Median Filter
The third approach to process the noise was to use Haar Wavelets. The Haar Wavelet
system is a sequence of ""square"" shaped functions that in union form an orthogonal
basis. By decomposing our signal with functions of higher levels (higher frequencies) we
can then remove the high frequency noise from the original signal and reconstruct our
smoother signal. We also implemented this in Python and set removed the nal 3 levels
of the orthogonal basis as a default to attempt to reduce noise.
Figure 38: Haar Wavelets
The experiment run on the linear acceleration signal of the IMU allowed us to further
analyze the ndings. Although our experiment mainly used default parameters recom-
mended by research and various community sources, we could see that the Low Pass
Filter was able to smoothen the noise to the highest degree. The Haar Wavelet decom-
position produced discrete time step approximations of the signal where the Median lter
also produced a smoother signal overall. The issue however is that we were still unable
19to account for the slight bias in the acceleration even with these approaches. Future
work will be to further explore Allan Variance testing which can help us characterize the
noise we are receiving and the level of bias instability. Additional exploration will also
consist of methods to directly address this slight bias in with greater precision.
Figure 39: Signal Noise Reduction Strategies
9 OAK-1 Camera
To further expose ourselves and improve our skills in robotics, data science, and gain
exposure in computer vision, we were lucky enough to begin experimentation with the
new OpenCV AI Kit OAK-1 Smart Camera. This is a brand new single-camera hardware
module that boasts camera capture of 4K video data at 60 fps or H.265 encoded at 30fps
[8]. The camera is only the size of a Raspberry Pi, but allows for the potential to run
advanced neural network models for object tracking, detection, semantic segmentation,
and corner detection on the camera itself. Thus, we can utilize this camera to ooad
perception computation processes from the Jetson NX and run them directly on the
OAK-1. The Goal is to mount the OAK-1 camera on the rear of our robot, similar to
the eorts of Tesla which utilize multiple cameras on their autonomus vehicles []. This
will allow our robot to gain rear perception sensing capability to complement the Intel
Realsense mounted in the front. Also, the OAK-1 only has a 70 degree eld of view and
cannot provide stereo depth due to it being a monocular camera, so it would be better
suited as a rear mounted camera. During the autonomous race we hope to enter, we
want to give our robot the ability to detect fast approaching opposition racer robots on
the racetrack, cones, and lanes from the rear to enhance our decision and navigation
logic in order to win the race. This way we can potentially gain the ability to ""cut"" o
opponent racers and better improve our own ideal ""racing"" line to achieve faster race
times and top rankings.
To interface with the OAK-1 we began by establishing connection to the Jetson. This
proved to be more dicult than on the personal macbook pro that was previously used.
A USB-C cable was required for this (which had to be switched), and a special driver had
to be downloaded for the Ubuntu 18.04 system. Furthermore, a /etc/udev/rules.d/80-
movidius.rules le needed to add json conguration parameters found through personal
20discussions on the Luxonis Support Discord Channel. We then were able to establish
a secure connection to the JNX. We then moved to integrate with ROS so we could
incorporate the OAK to our robot system. The ROS package provided by the Luxonis
Support team was is a recently published software that was warned to be error prone.
Thus, through another process of trial, error, debugging, and discussion we were able
to successfully launch the example MobileNet object detection neural network using
ROS. However, when attempting this process on a second JNX, we ran into opencv-
python errors that are still in the debugging phase. We then began collecting preliminary
data to identify an incoming opposition race car from the rear annotating these images
appropriately.
Figure 40:
 Figure 41:
Figure 42: OAK training data
Our future work will be to collect more training images of opposition robots from
a rear perspective and then train/netune a Mobilenet Object Detection SSD model
(which already includes 70 classes) to detect these robots. To train this model, we plan
to use a Stochastic Gradient Descent training strategy with an Adam Optimizer for 200
epochs. Based on previous discussions and research, this was a good benchmark to begin
our training. Additionally, we will employ Early Stopping strategy to stop model training
at the optimal weights. If possible, we would also utilize the UCSD GPU Cluster to train
our model to greatly improve training time and performance. We hope to also extend
our work to detecting the cones, lines, and road signs to best improve our perception
ability.
10 Conclusion
As the IMU and Odometry subteam, we have achieved most of our target goals we
dened at the beginning of this report and are ready to integrate our work with the nal
21robot. We gained a strong understanding of IMU and Odometry sensing and its ability to
provide valuable data for accurate robot localization. We derived position estimates using
Odometry, along with an analysis on future work to make this estimation more accurate
and robust. By devising tests for straight and turning paths we were able to analyze our
ndings and converge to an optimal parameter for the steering gain ERPM and steering
angle. We then successfully calibrated the IMU sensor and ran thorough tests to ensure
reliable measurements. Using a similar set of tests, we measured the accuracy of the
Yaw heading on a straight and turning path. This gave us insight into the strength of
the magnetic distortions which is critical to compenstate for onboard the robot. We also
investigated dierent IMU mounting approaches which highlighted the immense eect
the mount can have on the accuracy of the extremely sensitive IMU readings, allowing
us to better our mount for the 1/5 car. The Primary Heading estimate was derived from
not only the accelerometer and gyroscope, but also the magnetometer readings from
the Artemis IMU. This heading can now be easily consumed by a custom /yaw topic
or through default ROS messaging. We succeeded in integrating the Artemis IMU and
Odometry with ROS so that our data is easily digestable by other subteams, such as
the obstacle avoidance team, who wish to consume this data in order to enhance their
navigation models. Furthermore, the IMU and Odometry data is ready for fusion with
the GPS subteam within a Kalman Filter for future advancement of robot localization
methods. Finally, our work will ensure that we can hone the full potential of IMU and
Odometry sensors to improve the autonomous navigation of our nal robot.
11 Future Direction
Next, we hope to work on integrating the IMU and Odometry work into the 1/5 scale car
and testing the new IMU mount that was designed. Calibrating, tuning, and analyzing
the data on the 1/5 car will give us insight into the unique environment our sensors will
reside in and allow us to best prepare the car for success during the autonmous vehicle
race competition at the Thunderhill track in Northern California. This will also provide
us with invaluable data to analyze in order to further improve our IMU and Odometry
processing and integration into the navigation stack.
There are several future direction which we began to explore in order to further the
accuracy of our position estimate, heading, and data readings from IMU and Odome-
try. One is to delve into addressing the inescapable slight bias in IMU data readings
post calibration due to the extreme sensitivity of the sensor. Here, we aim to further
research the application of the Kalman Filter and potentially the Unscented Kalman
Filter to enhance our estimate. We also hope to conduct future work on researching
signal processing techniques and tests to reduce the IMU noise. Allan Variance testing
provides a potential method to characterize the noise and bias instability, so wecan more
precisely process this noise. We hope to conduct this analysis and apply new strategies
for noise compensation. Another approach would be to utilize multiple IMUs aboard the
robot to better compensate for the noise in readings. This would require a higher level
of calibration and synchronization, yet can be a promising approach and is one that is
often used in industry.
We would also like to continue our most recent work on the OAK Smart Camera. To
successfully complete the training of a Mobilenet Object Detection model for rear sensing
capability, we will have to nish collecting and annotating enough training image data for
the model. Based on previous exploration, we plan to use a SGD training strategy with an
Adam Optimizer for 200 epochs. Additionally, we will employ Early Stopping strategy to
stop model training at the optimal weights. If possible, we would also utilize the UCSD
GPU Cluster to train our model to greatly improve training time and performance.
Then, we would expand to detecting the cones, lines, and road signs from the rear to
best improve our perception ability.

skills to future oriented hardware systems, but also grow our skill sets vastly. We would

     Image Recognition in Stock Prediction with Visual Explanations from Grad-CAM   Jou-Ying Lee1, Shin Ehara2, Sohyun Lee3 123 Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute, University of California San Diego, CA, 92093, USA 1 jol067@ucsd.edu; 2 sehara@ucsd.edu; 3 sol107@ucsd.edu;  Abstract  Deep learning architectures are now publicly recognized and repeatedly proven to be powerful in a wide range of high-level prediction tasks. While these algorithms’ modeling generally have beyond satisfactory performances with apposite tuning, the long-troubling issue of this specific learning lies in the un-explainability of model learning and predicting. This interpretability of “how” machines learn is often times even more important than ensuring machines outputting “correct” predictions. Especially in the field of finance, users’ ability to dissect how and why an algorithm reached a conclusion from a business standpoint is integral for later applications of i.e., to be incorporated for business decision making, etc. This project studies similar prior work done on image recognition in the financial market and takes a step further on explaining predictions outputted by the Convolutional Neural Network by applying the Grad-CAM algorithm.   1. Introduction  With big data collected at an exponential growing speed today, the automated decision power this information is capable of providing has been recognized and has since been at the forefront of technological developments – especially in the area of Artificial Intelligence.   Throughout the past decade, several machine learning algorithms have been developed with distinct strengths and each different useful area of applications. While most traditional models have presented outstanding potentials in pattern recognitions for structured data, their computing power and learning abilities are however, not sufficient on large, complicated input dataset. To address this drawback, deep learning models are introduced, and have up to today – a proven record of impressive learning performances on large-scale data such as audios, images and even videos.       
    While prediction powers of these algorithms are not to be neglected, deep learning models however also come with a major problem that has been long troubling these algorithm users – that is the “un-explainability” of these algorithms.   In order to capture these complex patterns within datasets, deep learning models are by nature, very intricated in their architectures. This, however, makes it extremely difficult or most of the times, nearly impossible for users to manually track or inspect models’ learning processes. Although having a nice portfolio of model accuracies might be beneficial in performing prediction tasks, access to this training procedure is equally integral to understand how a projected outcome is made. In context of this project’s setting -- being able to tell why a model forecasted stock trends to behave in a specific way is crucial for users’ reference when making investment decisions. Regardless of disciplines for application, common concern users have raised with respect to deep learning algorithms is the difficulty in trusting model outcomes. Due to the lack of interpretability in model functionality, many researchers in fact choose to forfeit model accuracies in exchange for more trust and certainties in outputted results.   This project is thereby carefully structured after attempt to address this problem. We aim to add and build trust into deep learning systems by introducing more explainability into machine learning. Specifically, we chose one of the most complicated application for both prediction and explanation – and that is the area of finance, i.e., this research works towards introducing interpretability into modeling in the stock market, to enable users of more trustable insights and references during investment decision makings. In specific, we investigate the key indicator in stock investment – the stock price. Additionally, we pick to base the project on a diversified stock index – NIFTY 100 – in hope of a more systematic and wholistic view into the financial market. By inspecting deep learning model’s prediction on stock price behaviors, i.e., whether a stock price increases or decreases throughout daily trading period, we aim to provide an explainable view into such financial decisions made by computer algorithms.  2. Preliminaries  2.1. Stock Market Price Change (Label)  The stock market is undoubtedly one of the most unpredictable, yet most popular areas for financial investment. Through facilitating exchanges of securities between buyers and sellers, this marketplace creates opportunities of capital gain for participants ranging from small individuals to big entities such as banks or conglomerates.  While there are countless financial measures in security discussions, this study focuses on one of the most direct assessments, i.e., the closing stock price. “The closing price is considered the most     
    accurate valuation of a stock or other security until trading resumes on the next trading day” and is defined as “the last price at which the stock traded during the regular trading day” (Kenton).   As we purposefully structured this project as a classification task, this target for investigation is therefore transformed to be introduced as a binary label for model learning. For our project’s investigation purposes, we assign one class only to each day to represent trades that happen on that day. In specific, we compare the opening price to the closing price of a specific day in order to make a careful call on assigning an “increase” or “decrease” label to the combined daily stock entries.  The India’s National Market Exchange market opens on 9:15 AM, and marks market closing on 3:30 PM across weekdays. We turned away from traditional considerations on pre-market hours and after-market hours for study, and adapted our target of investigation to be the price difference between the earliest opening price and latest closing price trading entries during a day. If this difference is of a positive output: that signals an “increase” in stock value, while a negative output suggests the opposite. Therefore, summarizing that described above, given a particular day, we have our binary labels represented as the following:  𝐶𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠=	∆𝐶𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔!""#$%	=𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒&'(%)(−𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒*'""+#%)(	=11,𝑖𝑓>	0,𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑒0	,𝑖𝑓≤0,𝑑𝑒𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑒  2.2. Methodology  While most prevalent approaches to stock prediction might base around modelling with time series data, this research purposefully structures this attempt as an image classification task – both to explore deep learning algorithms’ capability on learning non-conventional images, and to inspect explainability of these neural networks.   Specifically, this is done by encoding time series data as images by using Gramian Angular Field and applying Grad-CAM algorithm over the learned CNN model to inspect generated class-activation maps for visual explanations of the deep neural network.  2.2.1.  Gramian Angular Field (GAF)  Gramian Angular Field is an image obtained by transforming time series data. In GAF, time series is represented in a polar coordinate system by taking advantage of the Gram Matrix (Oates and Zhiguang). Specifically, the Gram Matrix has a key advantage of preserving the temporal dependency -- “Since time increases as the position moves from top-left to bottom-right, the time dimension is encoded into the geometry of the matrix” (Vitry).      
    Finally, steps to obtain each GAF is extracted from Zhiguang Wang and Tim Oates publication: Imaging Time-Series to Improve Classification and Imputation, and are summarized as follows:  Given a times series X = {𝑥,,…, 𝑥-},  we rescale X so that all values fall in the interval [-1, 1] by:  𝑥:#.,=(𝑥#−𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑋)+(𝑥#−𝑚𝑖𝑛	(𝑋))𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑋)−𝑚𝑖𝑛	(𝑋)  We can then represent the rescaled time series	𝑋@ in polar coordinates by encoding the value as the angular cosine and the time stamp as the radius with the equation below, where 𝑡# is the time stamp and N is a constant factor to regularize the span of the polar coordinate system:  B𝜙=arccos(𝑥/I),−1≤𝑥/I≤1,𝑥/I∈𝑋K𝑟=𝑡#𝑁,𝑡#∈ℕ	  After this rescaling transformation, the angular perspective is then exploited by considering the trigonometric sum/difference between each point to identify the temporal correlation within different time intervals.  In particular, our project exploits Gramian Difference Angular Field (GADF) that is defined as follows, where “I is the unit row vector [1, 1, …, 1]” (Wang and Time Oates).   𝐺𝐴𝐷𝐹=Rsin	(𝜙#−𝜙0)U=V𝐼−𝑋K12∙𝑋K−𝑋K2∙V𝐼−𝑋K1  Finally, Figure 1 is a cited illustration of the various steps of encoding time series as Gramian Angular Field images.  
 Figure 1: Various steps of the Gramian Angular Field Conversion (Vitry)     
    
    2.2.2.  Gradient Weighted Class Activation Map (Grad-CAM)  Grad-CAM is an “Explainable AI” technique developed in 2016 by Selvaraju et al. It is introduced with a primary goal of boosting confidence in applying neural networks – making it possible for visual analysis on misclassified instances for detecting discrepancies. By “producing ‘visual explanations’ for decisions from large class of CNN-based models, making them more transparent”, Grad-CAM helps people better understand a wide range of tasks, including image classification, image captioning, and visual question answering models, etc. (Selvaraju et al.).  Briefly summarizing the working process of Grad-CAM (see Figure 2): given a picture and a class as input, Grad-CAM forward-propagates the image through the network model to get raw class scores before the Softmax layer (Selvaraju et al.). A gradient signal with only the inputted class set to 1 and others to 0 is then back-propagated to the rectified Conv feature maps – where coarse localization is calculated and a heatmap is generated (Selvaraju et al.). Finally, the pointwise multiplications of this heatmap and guided backpropagation produces Guided Grad-CAM visualizations (Selvaraju et al.).

NIFTY 100 is a stock index in India’s National Stock Exchange and represents the major sectors of the country’s economy. This index is chosen after careful investigation into the condition of its available dataset. Compared to 
    
    many other datasets on financial markets, NIFTY 100 stands out by its rather complete and integral structure.   Made available by Kaggle Competition, the NIFTY 100 dataset covers abundant historical intraday minute-level transactions, ranging from January 2, 2017 to January 1, 2021. There are in total 988 days in this dataset. Trade information on this dataset include opening, closing, high, low prices as well as the transaction volume corresponding to each minute trade. The next section shows extracted information from our training dataset.  3.1.1. Stock Data in Time Series Representation  Transaction data of NIFTY 100 from January 2, 2017 to January 1, 2021 were obtained. Figure 3 is a time series representation of the closing price of the data throughout this period. Here, one interesting insight observed is how trading has been especially volatile since the coronavirus pandemic in the early 2020. Although the stock price has been increasing throughout those past years, the extreme price drop at the beginning of the pandemic illustrates the uncertainty associated with stock trading and the exceptional difficulty to predicting price movements.  
  Figure 3: Daily Closing Price of NIFTY 100 from 2017-01-02 to 2021-01-01.  The focus of our prediction is to explore whether it is possible to forecast if an index price increases or decreases thorough a day just by looking at the “first one hour of trading”. As an example, the below Figure 4 represents the closing price of NIFTY 100 on January 1, 2021. Here, we observe that the index price ended up Net-Positive that day. However, inspecting closely, the price decreased during the first hours of trading and then rose strongly later that day. Again, this observation too indicates that our prediction task is very difficult for a human without much experience in the market to accurately perform.  
    
      Figure 4: Minute-level Closing Price of NIFTY 100 on 2021-01-01 - Full Market Hours.   3.1.2. Stock Price Data in Image Representation  As explained previously, in order to approach our price change prediction goal as an image classification task exploiting the CNN model, we leveraged the technique Gramian Angular Field to turn these time series representations into image data.  Continuing with the example we used for demonstration above, Figure 5 is a time series chart displaying the minute-level closing price of NIFTY 100 during the first hour of trading (from 9:15 – 10:14 AM local) on January 1, 2021. This time series data totaling an hour (with 60 data points) corresponds to one image representation we are using as input to our CNN model.

    converted from these polar coordinates. In total, 988 converted images for each of the 988 days of time series data are obtained.  array([[[ 0.,  0.,  2., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],  [ 0.,  0.,  2., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],  [-2., -2.,  0., ..., -2., -2., -2.],  ...,  [ 0.,  0.,  2., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],  [ 0.,  0.,  2., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.],  [ 0.,  0.,  2., ...,  0.,  0.,  0.]]])

Deep Learning   3.2.1 Market Prediction with CNN Model using FastAI Library  We used FastAI, a PyTorch-based deep learning library, to build the neural network. This enables us to figure out the relationship between input features and find hidden relationships within them. The input data is an image dataset with labels -- converted from time series with Gramian Angular Field as described in the previous section.   The entire dataset of 988 days (image instances) was divided into training and validation sets, with a 20% validation ratio. Our training procedure followed the following steps.  1. Create a baseline model, i.e., ResNet-34. 2. Find the optimal learning rate for the initial layers where the numerical gradients are minimized. 3. Train the model with the learning rate found in (1) with 10 epochs. 
    
    4. Unfreeze the model and find the optimal learning rate for all the layers where the numerical gradients are minimized. 5. Train the model with the learning rate found in (3) with 10 epochs.  For the CNN network, the pretrained ResNET-34 is utilized as the bottom layers. We added [1024, 2] dense layers on top and a simple linear activation node for the final regression as a custom head (See Table 1). Table 1 below shows the architecture of the top layers of the model. For the loss function, our final model utilizes Cross-Entropy loss, and for model performance measuring metric, we leverage the use of accuracy scores.  Table 1: Top Layers Summary on CNN Learner Sequential (0): AdaptiveConcatPool2d (ap): AdaptiveAvgPool2d(output_size=1) (mp): AdaptiveMaxPool2d(output_size=1) (1): Flatten() (2): Linear(in_features=1024, out_features=2, bias=True)   3.2.2 Model Performance  After the training procedure described above, the CNN model constantly achieves an accuracy score around 62% on the validation set. Figure 7 below shows the confusion matrix of our final model. We can observe that the model works quite equally for both of the two classes with the false positive rate being a little bit higher than the false negative rate.  
  Figure 7: Confusion Matrix on implemented CNN Model  Figures  below show sample instances from our validation results, where class “1” means the index price went up that given day and the class “0” indicates the opposite. 
    
     
 Figure 8: Training Results Sample  3.3 Grad-CAM inspection  This section summarizes results generated by applying the Grad-CAM Algorithm over our Gramian Angular Field converted time series data.   Before discussion on developed results, it is important to note that results shown below are made available by leveraging third-party Grad-CAM API instead of using Grad-CAM algorithm we trained ourselves. This interface is favored over ours due to it enabling additional visualizations for inspection – that include Guided Grad-CAM, gradients by vanilla backpropagation, gradients by guided backpropagation, and gradients by deconvnet. Trained on a different image database but sharing the same internal architecture of ResNet-34, we specify the target layer, i.e., layer4 in the algorithm for visualization. For there are only two classes in our prediction task, outputs on only the top 1 class of two sample images are generated.  
    
    Table 2: Visual Explanation from Various Algorithms Predicted Class = 1 GAF Image: 2017-01-03 GAF Image: 2021-01-01 Original Image   Grad-CAM   Vanilla Backpropagation   DeconvNet    Guided Backpropagation   
    
    Guided Grad-CAM    Brief description of each visual explanation: • Grad-CAM – “uses the class-specific gradient information flowing into the final convolutional layer of a CNN to produce a coarse localization map of the important regions in the image” (Selvaraju et al.). • Vanilla Backpropagation – or Gradients, “commonly referred to as saliency maps’ or ‘backpropagation” (Draelos). It is a “visualization of an image in which the most salient/most important pixels are highlighted” (Draelos). • DeconvNets – “DeconvNets are the same as the “Gradients” approach except for a difference in backpropagation through the ReLU nonlinearity” (Draelos). • Guided Backpropagation – or Guided Saliency, “combines vanilla backpropagation and DeconvNets when handling the ReLU nonlinearity” (Draelos). • Guided Grad-CAM – “This is an element-wise product of GradCAM with Guided Backpropagation” (Draelos).  While a first look at the generated Grad-CAM results may seem confusing, but it is important to notice how in the shown sample images -- the visual explanation maps seem to all be suggesting that information towards the top-left corner is comparably more important than that of the rest. This can be seen from patterns exhibited in results generated by Vanilla Backpropagation, DeconvNet, and Guided Backpropagation. The same is even more apparent from that in Grad-CAM: judging by the colors from heatmap mapped on top of the gramian angular fields, the red color -- signifying “visualizing ‘the most important information’” – are both present towards the top-left corner. Guided Grad-CAM shows similar results with more enhanced presence.   To explain this result, we recall the key characteristic of Gramian Angular Field – it preserves temporal dependencies of time series as the position moves from the top-left corner to the bottom-right. Keeping this in mind while further inspecting visual explanations on all generated images, it is discovered that areas spanning the entire middle portion (from left to right) of Gramian Angular Fields seem to be most frequently highlighted. In relation to our original time series, this means that trades that happen during the middle of the hour of the trading period gives comparably more importance on predicting price “increase” or “decrease” than the rest of the daily entries.    
    
    4. Conclusion  Machine learning implementations in areas from pattern learning to target predictions have been at the center of computational research and development throughout the past decade. These mechanisms for label forecasting have today arrived at an unprecedented height with outstanding performances. The technology industry adapts machine learning practices in applications from hardware to software; The manufacturing industry has automated manufacturers made available by AI implants; The entertainment and sports industry take advantage of information that was never available before the recommending power of machine learning; And the healthcare industry leverages recognition abilities powered by these algorithms for early diagnoses and therapy provisions, etc.    Enabled by more mature hardware computational power, and fostered by the immense amount of information collected, artificial intelligence has expanded its learning power to applications on data larger than ever before. Developed with the special strength on pattern learning in audios, images and videos, deep neural networks has proven its powerful recognition power across these big data. However, with the commanding prediction potential comes along these deep learning algorithms’ un-explainability.   Previously with traditional machine learning algorithm, models’ prediction process are easily traced and tracked; However, due to the intricated architectural nature of deep learning models, this is no longer the case. Users commonly find it difficult to interpret how neural networks make their outputs, and this has therefore led to an issue of trust in systems like such. In sectors where interpretability of model learning progress is important, deep learning models cannot be deployed despite their guaranteed satisfactory performances. A representative example of such is the financial industry – an example of “implementing decision-making algorithms that cannot be understood on sensitive banking or market data” shall explain users’ resistance on these practices.   This research project has therefore been structured specially to address this issue of “un-explainability” in deep learning models, i.e., CNN models in particular, and employs novel computational approaches in an attempt to introduce trust on using neural networks in the stock market prediction.   This project starts off with data pre-processing on stock data. Binary labels of “1” signifying closing price increase, and “0” representing the opposite were engineered as prediction targets. These time series data are then converted via use of Gramian Angular Field into image coordinates, and visualized for FastAI recognition task. Deployment of Grad-CAM is then introduced for visual inspections on the CNN model prediction process as our primary research output.       
    In particular, application of the Grad-CAM algorithm along with multiple additional visual explanation techniques including: Vanilla Backpropagation, DeconvNet, Guided Backpropagation and Guided Grad-CAM have been able to provide us with extra and novel insights into traditionally time-series represented stock-market data. In specific, we concluded that stock closing prices during the middle of trading periods during the day is more important than prices closer to market beginning or even market closing in predicting stock price increase. This is suggested by inspecting on pixel areas the Grad-CAM algorithm recognized and highlighted as significant in CNN model prediction of label 1, i.e. market price increase. This insight can be rather counter-intuitive to most financial investors, as one might expect the market condition closer to the end of a day’s trading period being more important in drawing a conclusion on price change. However, given our best performing model’s predictions, it is suggested of otherwise.   5. Discussion  Summarizing our work in general, while we have completed all above tasks as we have proposed, we also recognize and acknowledge that there are room for improvements and developments, we thereby describe these as follows:  Deep learning application in this project is structured purposefully as an image classification task, which is why we leveraged Gramian Angular Field for time series to image conversions. This approach is closely followed after prior research conducted on similar investigations, but none of these former studies took the additional step to apply Grad-CAM for visual explanations. It is discussed by us, researchers, that an alternative approach towards explaining the CNN model prediction may be suggested. This is because that images generated by Gramian Angular Field do not possess significant meanings, nor does there exist apparent objects for recognition. These two reasons combined makes explanations on results generated by Grad-CAM very difficult -- When mapping an image with its visual explanations, it is difficult to pinpoint the localization on the Gramian Angular Field. Going forward, this therefore makes it challenging to connect visual explanations with the financial market context. Founding on these discoveries and reflections, we believe it is appropriate for us to conclude that adopting explanatory techniques other than visuals is suggested.  Secondly, we believe that there is room for achievable improvements with implementing our CNN model. Given the limited research period we have, our best performing model has an accuracy score of 62%. Although given the highly unpredictable nature of the stock market, this performance may be appreciated in various cases, we also believe that the algorithm can be further enhanced to achive even better results. In specific, some potential ways to accomplish this can include:       
    • Changing the base model from ResNet-34 to other architectures. • Further tuning model hyper-parameters. • Switching Loss Function from Cross-Entropy Loss to other functions for optimization. • Employing other model structures such as combining CNN with RSTM, etc.   Last but not least, we also believe that explainability of financial data in our problem setting may be better enhanced by improving our Grad-CAM implementation itself as well. This can be done by applying more suitable training on the Grad-CAM so it fits our training data. Additionally, although we are able to propose an explanation of which (or what kind of) stock market data serves an important role in CNN model learning with help of visuals, this conclusion may however, vary widely given different problem settings. Currently, with this project’s setup, conclusions are drawn upon visual inspections, and therefore might not be as precise than a problem setup of scientific investigations. A solution to this is therefore proposed to be development of computable scores for justifying the importance and effect of Grad-CAM’s application.

    7. Appendix  A. Project Proposal  With big data collected at an exponential growing speed today, the automated decision power these information is capable of providing has been recognized and has since been at the forefront of technological developments -- especially in the area of artificial intelligence.   Throughout the past decade, hundreds of machine learning algorithms have been developed with distinct strengths and useful areas of application. However, these models are commonly introduced as traditional baseline models because they do not generalize or perform well on “large datasets” such as images, audios, or videos, etc. Nowadays, tools applied for pattern recognition are advancing more towards prevalent uses of deep learning models that learn and recognize complex underlying data patterns. While these models have proven outstanding abilities in making predictions based on complicated input data, the problem lies in these algorithms’ “un-explainability”. Regardless of the problem being solved, let it be image recognition, object detection, or involved predictions, given the overly complex nature of these deep neural networks, users have commonly found it hard to trust the works of these outcomes -- because their learning process is practically untrackable, therefore resulting in un-explainability of these final predictions. Inspired by this phenomenon, this proposal presents a project that sets to address this issue in machine learning.   Hoping to resolve actual concerns arising from real-life practices, this project revolves around deep learning applications within the financial market. It is undebatable that the stock market is one of the most unpredictable and difficult areas of study, yet investigation into product price and return have always been at the center in quantitative analysis. Stock data are most commonly represented as time series, and therefore have previously primarily been modelled with traditional time series algorithms or conventional baseline machine learning models. While RNNs and LSTMs are now more frequently used to predict these time series trends, this project intends to also include CNNs to provide a comprehensive study on the performances of image recognition versus other techniques in predicting the financial market.   As the financial market is changing all the time, this project projects to work not only on historical stock data but also real-time daily and minute level financial market data. Therefore, Yahoo Finance, as one of the most reliable stock exchange sources, is to be deployed for analyses. There is readily available PythonAPI which enables remote data access to the market data, and will be pulled and utilized as the data source for this research.      
    Table 1 below shows the ending five entries of aggregated price data on a daily basis for S&P 500 ETF Trust stock market data between June 2020 to December 2020, and Figure 1 is a Time Series representation of the closing price through this whole period.  
 Table1: S&P 500 ETF Trust stock data pulled from Yahoo! Finance  
 Figure1: S&P 500 ETF Trust stock data closing price plot (2020-06-01 -- 2020-12-01)  In specific, the volatility of a specific market during a specific time period will be inspected, and therefore this problem for prediction is purposefully structured as a regression-based prediction. The focus for this project will be image recognition based regression -- that is using CNN networks for time series prediction. Time series will be converted to image based polar coordinate relationships to assemble this approach as an image recognition task. Meta-Labelling technique will be applied to these time series in order to provide the outcomes of stock forecasting labels of “sell” or “buy” for classification. Similar research has shown that CNNs are able to achieve satisfying accuracy scores, yet none have explained the reasoning behind this. While this shall not be too big of a surprise, this project sets to address this particular problem by applying the Grad-CAM algorithm to this built CNN network. By inspecting the class-activation maps generated by this technique, and mapping them to the convolutional architecture, this project aims to study why 
    
    the network made the prediction it did, as well as how parts in these images might have contributed to making the correct or incorrect decisions.  This project will require all members in the group to truly grasp model details regarding CNN models, and at the same time solidly understand conceptual and implemental components of the Grad-CAM algorithm. The outcome of this project is proposed to be a written paper with thorough descriptions on algorithm implementation details as well as justifications for model performances.  B. Initial Attempts to Use Different Datasets and Measurements such as Volatility  We were initially using Tesla Inc.’s stock (TSLA) obtained with the finance API AlphaAdvantage for the same purpose. However, this dataset contains many null values and many of the data points of specific minutes that we hope to manipulate on were unavailable. After a number of attempts with this dataset, we were finally unable to achieve a decent CNN model accuracy with it and decided to employ other datasets. After leaving this AlphaAdvantage dataset, there had been numerous attempts to achieve a decent model accuracy with different stock datasets from various sources, before eventually finding the NIFTY 100 dataset that we are using in this project.   We also initially used stock volatility as a measurement metric for this study, referencing to the prior study by Bai. We attempted to converting volatility time series data into image instance using GAF and built a deep learning model based on them. However, this attempt also did not result in successful prediction results, thus we eventually shifted our focus to recognition on pure stock prices instead of stock volatility.  ","This project focuses on image recognition in stock prediction using the Grad-CAM algorithm. Deep learning models have shown impressive performance in prediction tasks, but their lack of explainability has been a challenge. In the financial industry, understanding how and why an algorithm makes predictions is crucial for decision-making. The project aims to provide visual explanations for predictions made by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the Grad-CAM algorithm. The dataset used is the NIFTY 100 stock index, and time series data is converted into images using Gramian Angular Field. The CNN model achieves an accuracy score of around 62% on the validation set. The Grad-CAM algorithm provides insights into the important regions in the images that contribute to predictions. The results suggest that stock prices during the middle of trading periods are more important for predicting price changes. However, there is room for improvement in both the CNN model and the Grad-CAM implementation."

Abstract
Many models and algorithms in artiﬁcial in-
telligence are considered “black box mod-
els”, or models that do not provide trans-
parency into how it reached a certain conclu-
sion; ultimately, although they may be accu-
rate, they are uninterpretable by humans and
lack trust and transparency. We aim to pro-
vide this transparency through explainable
artiﬁcial intelligence. First and foremost, we
aim to present a model that can determine
if individuals are properly wearing a mask,
improperly wearing a mask, or are not wear-
ing a mask at all in the light of the Covid-19
pandemic. Especially as this is a high stakes
situation, with businesses and individuals at
risk, transparency is key. Secondly, we aim
to provide this transparency through Grad-
CAM, which will highlight how our model
came to its decision. The method uses an
untrained Inception Resnet V1 in order to
determine the mask usage in a given im-
age. Gradient Descent is used for training
and Cross Entropy as a loss function. Fi-
nally, GradCAM is applied to the images and
outputs a coarse heatmap from the last lay-
ers of our convolutional neural network that
shows exactly what our model is looking at.
Currently, we are able to reach a model with
96% accuracy.
1 Introduction
An MIT article, published in late 2019 by Rudin and
Radin, explains the unnecessary supply of black box
models, or models which can be viewed in terms of
its “inputs and outputs, without any knowledge of itsinternal workings”.1Rudin and Radin explain how the
advances in deep learning for computer vision have led
to the trend of “inherently uninterpretable and compli-
cated”2models, in which there is a lack of transparency
to humans in being able to understand how a certain
model came to a certain conclusion. Stemming from
the historical use of machine learning in society, such
as “online advertising and web search,”2black box ma-
chine learning models initially proved effective; how-
ever, these initial models did not necessarily deeply im-
pact human lives. With the growing use and power of
machine learning that now has the power to do so, it is
clear that explainable artiﬁcial intelligence is a neces-
sity, that “the belief that accuracy must be sacriﬁced
for interpretability is inaccurate”2, and that we should
aim to provide transparency and understanding to any
model, especially for high stakes decisions. Our aim
was to apply transparency to face mask detection, in
light of the Coronavirus pandemic. As of early Febru-
ary, Coronavirus (known as Covid-19) has infected
over 100 million individuals throughout the world, and
has killed over 2.3 million, nearly 500,000 of those
being Americans3. According to the CDC, Covid-19
spreads most commonly through close contact, primar-
ily when individuals with COVID-19 “cough, sneeze,
sing, talk, or breathe”4as the virus is transmitted
through respiratory droplets. Moreover, these viruses
may infect others not in close contact through airborne
transmission. According to John Brooks, a medical
epidemiologist at the CDC in Atlanta, “masks bring

tect others, rather than oneself. Masks are imperative
to helping prevent the spread of coronavirus; however,
they must also be worn properly. However, implement-
ing this on a grand scale is difﬁcult. Establishments,
such as schools and businesses, would need a scal-
able system to ensure correct mask usage in order to
keep their brand image, as they could be shunned or
shut down for not following mask protocols, and more
importantly, keep their employees and customers safe.
We aim to provide this solution through a face mask
image recognition algorithm using a subsection of the
MaskedFace-Net dataset6, which contains images of
properly and improperly worn masks. Moreover, we
aim to provide transparency through GradCAM, in or-
der to ensure that our model is coming to the right con-
clusions for the right reasons, especially in such an en-
vironment concerning public health. Ultimately, our
hope is to create an algorithm that ensures transparency
and trust, that has the potential to help human lives.
2 Literature Review
There have been several other advances when it comes
to face mask detection in light of the coronavirus.
Nagrath, Jain, Madan, Arora, Kataria, and Hemanth
trained a real time DNN-based face mask detection
system, and utilized deep learning, TensorFlow, Keras,
and OpenCV7. Utilizing a dataset containing “with
mask” and “without mask” labels of 5521 images each,
they were able to utilize MobileNetV2, a Deep Neu-
ral Network deployed for classiﬁcation, and utilized
the pretrained weights of ImageNet. Moreover, al-
though the dataset was smaller than our FaceMasked-
Net, it held a combination of real and artiﬁcial images.
Their approach was the SSDMNV2 approach, which
utilized Single Shot Multibox as a face detector and
MobilenetV2 as a framework. After 100 epochs, they
received a training accuracy of 92.64% and an F1 score
of 93%. As reference, AlexNet and LeNet-5 were also
two architectures used, and received a lower accuracy
of 89.2% and 84.6%, respectively. The work of SS-

is a real time detector. Similarly, A Deep Learning

Mask for Human Safety with YOLOv3 had a high ac-
curacy rate of 96%, trained over 4000 epochs and had
real time detection, with an average output of 17 fps
8. Their dataset consisted of a web-scraping tool to
collect 650 images of masked and unmasked, each.
This dataset consisted of natural face mask images and
was not artiﬁcial, unlike ours. It also contained sev-
eral various types of face masks of different materials.
There are a myriad of other algorithms done on face
mask detection, with various CNN architectures; how-
ever, it should be noted that many of the current al-
gorithms do not necessarily go in depth to incorrectly
worn masks, which is a large problem in the context of
the pandemic. This is a gap we aim to solve with our
FaceMasked-Net dataset.
3 Dataset
We utilized a subsection of the MaskedFace-Net
dataset9. The dataset itself is a cumulation of 133,783
images based on the dataset Flickr-Faces-HQ, and
consists of a blue medical face mask photoshopped
over various faces, either correctly or incorrectly.
Of the incorrectly worn masks, there are three cat-
egories: Uncovered chin, uncovered noise, and un-
covered nose and mouth, as wearing a mask properly
ensures its effectiveness. The dataset for our model
was taken off Sheldon Sebastian’s MaskedFace-Net
Kaggle10dataset, which contains 58,582 images total.
This dataset contained images as follows: for covered
faces, 12362 images in the train folder, 3863 images in
the holdout folder, and 3090 images in the validation
folder; for incorrect faces, 12338 images in the train
folder, 3856 images in the holdout folder, 3084 im-
ages in the validation folder; for completely uncovered
faces, 12800 images in the train folder, 3090 images
in the holdout folder, and 3199 images in the valida-
tion folder. Of the incorrectly worn mask labels, 10184

rect labels were a correctly covered Mouth and Chin
but uncovered nose, making the dataset of incorrectly
worn masks slightly unbalanced. The dataset contains
images of faces, including a variety of ethnicity, gen-
ders, and ages, which ensures that our model will be
applicable to a variety of individuals.

worn masks, and uncovered faces

Moreover, as the coronavirus pandemic began in late
2019 to early 2020, there were few public datasets
with extensive mask-wearing; although the masks in
this dataset are photoshopped on rather than naturally
worn, the dataset was one of the few that had a large
number of images with the granularity of why a mask
was worn improperly and we found as appropriate for
our problem. However, it should be noted that there are
some disadvantages to this dataset, which are outlined
in our discussion section below.

MaskedFace-Net dataset of an individual with a prop-
erly worn mask. The mask is photoshopped.
4 Methodology
Inception ResNet V1 is a variant of the original
FaceNet Model and was the architecture we utilized
in pytorch; although it is pre-trained on both the VG-
GFACE2 and Casia-Webface datasets, we utilized an
untrained model with 3 classes. The Inception ResNet
model is unique in that typical CNNs have stacked con-
volutional layers followed by one or more fully con-
nected layers; Inception on the other hand, all ﬁlters
in the Inception model are learned and repeated many
times.The main idea of Inception is ""how an optimal
local sparse structure in a convolutional vision network
can be approximated and covered by readily available
dense components11Inception Resnet ﬁnds the opti-
mal local construction and repeats it spatially; this was
done through a layer by layer construction in which
correlation statistics of the previous layer are clustered
in to groups, which form the units of the next layer.
In the lower layers, various clusters would be concen-
trated in a single location and covered by a layer of
1x1 convolutions; however, as features of higher ab-
straction are captured by higher layers, this concen-
tration should decrease, and therefore increase in 3x3
and 5x5 convolutions, as Inception Resnet is limited
to 1x1, 3x3, and 5x5 ﬁlters. However, as these are
computationally expensive, Inception Resnet applies
dimensionality reduction wherever it is too computa-
tionally expensive. In terms of our model classiﬁca-
tion, 3 classes were utilized - incorrectly worn face
masks, correctly worn face masks, and no face masks
11https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4842v1.pdfdetected/uncovered face. In terms of labelling, this
dataset did not contain any bounding boxes, but rather,
had images in folders with the folder name having the
respective label. For image preprocessing, the images
were resized to 256 x 256 and transformed into ten-
sors; as Inception ResNet V1 works best with images
that are cropped to the face, our dataset proved helpful
as it was precropped and no other preprocessing steps
took place. Cross Entropy was the loss function uti-
lized, and the Adam algorithm was utilized as the opti-
mizer object, which holds the current state and updates
parameters based on computed gradients with a learn-
ing rate of 0.009 as a hyperparameter; 2 epochs were
used to train the model.
GradCAM, or Gradient weighted Class Activation
Mapping, was utilized in order to provide transparency.
GradCam uses gradient information from a target con-
cept that is ﬂowing into the last convolutional layer of
the CNN. Ultimately, it results in a coarse heat map
that essentially show which parts of the image helped
the model lead to it’s ﬁnal decision - essentially, the
most important parts of the image. GradCAM was ap-
plied to our model in order to ensure that it was looking
in the correct areas.
5 Results and Discussion
The result of our model was an accuracy of 96% in be-
ing able to classify between the three classes: improper
face mask usage, no mask, and proper face mask usage.
In terms of Grad-CAM, the implementation was suc-
cessful in building trust and transparency within our
model: the model was looking at the correct areas to
determine the face mask usage.
Figure 4: A female with proper face mask usage
Figure 5: The coarse localization map of GradCAM
Figure 6: A GradCAM heatmap overlayed onto the
original image, which pinpoints the important parts of
the image that led to the result
Figures 4 to 6 show the GradCAM heatmap on an in-
dividual who wore a face mask properly.
Figures 7 to 9 show an individual with improper usage
as it only covers his chin; this is seen in our GradCAM
output as well - GradCAM shows that our model was
looking heavily at the chin area. Overall, our model
was fairly successful, and was able to reach a level of
trust. However, there were several weaknesses in our
model. To begin with: the dataset. The dataset only
contains blue medical face masks - it does not contain
cloth masks, KN95, or N-95 masks, which are also
commonly used; therefore, we are not sure how our
model may perform given another face mask. More-Figure 7: A male with improper face mask usage; his
mask only covers his chin
Figure 8: The coarse localization map of GradCAM
over, some face masks are less effective than others,
such as a cloth mask vs an N-95 mask, which is less
available to the public. This weakness can be attributed
to the lack of datasets available on face masks - there
are several datasets with face masks in real images;
however, many did not include improper face mask us-
age (only mask or no mask) as well as the reason be-
hind why it may have been deemed as ""improper."" Fur-
thermore, the dataset consisted of photoshopped face
masks on cropped faces: ultimately, this is an artiﬁ-
cially made dataset. Another weakness would be the
accuracy of 96%; although it is fairly high, consid-
ering the high stakes situation, having 4% inaccurate
classiﬁcations could have detrimental effects (such as
Figure 9: A GradCAM heatmap overlayed onto the
original image, which pinpoints the important parts of
the image that led to the result
if someone who was Covid-19 positive did not wear a
mask properly, and it was deemed proper usage by our
model). Finally, due to computational and time con-
straints, we were not able to implement our model in
real time, which would be necessary if one were to use
our model to scale it for a business or school. How-
ever, regardless of various weaknesses, we were able to
complete our goal of having a model that users could
trust. The outputs of our project included a front-end
static website for general audiences, a recorded presen-
tation, and a GitHub repo. Links can be found in the

Project Proposal Statement: A lot of neural networks
are a “black box” which does not provide understand-
ing or insight into how a model or algorithm reached
a conclusion; this means a certain model could reach
a conclusion, although a correct conclusion, for the
wrong reasons and we would not be aware. Trans-
parency is needed, ﬁrst to recognize and pinpoint any
failures a model can have, but also second, if a model
works, this transparency builds trust to those utilizing
an algorithm. We propose to bring this transparency
into a mask recognition model, which would be able
to identify whether or not an individual is properly
wearing a mask. We aim to train a model which can
determine whether or not an individual is wearing a
mask properly or improperly and which concerns pub-
lic safety - with high stakes such as these, trust and
transparency into our model is a must. As Covid-
19 has killed over 290,000 Americans as of Decem-
ber, proper mask usage is increasingly important, as it
helps prevent the spread of Coronavirus. People areeither outright refusing to wear masks, or sometimes
cheating the system by wearing masks incorrectly or
unknowingly. By this, we refer to those that wear
masks that do not tightly cover the mouth, nose, and
chin. As a result, the efﬁcacy of the mask is nearly
zero, posing both a large public health risk as well
as also potentially being detrimental to brand imag-
ing. Establishments risk being shut down if they do
not abide by CDC guidelines, and furthermore peo-
ple simply won’t want to go to these establishments
if they are a large safety risk. Clearly, businesses are
motivated to ensure the people in their establishments
are wearing masks properly, and current solutions are
inefﬁcient when scaled. Our solution scales well and
is much more cost effective than hiring manual work-
ers to make sure everyone is wearing a mask prop-
erly. Real-time convolutional neural networks are get-
ting signiﬁcantly better with the advent of YOLOv4.
Even if people only appeared in the frame of the cam-
era for a short amount of time, we would be able to
build a network to detect them. Building Grad CAM
into YOLOv4 is relatively simple as well, since with
the open source Darknet version, all we would need to
do is implement Grad CAM into the convolutional and
pooling layers to build our explanation. Using Grad
CAM simpliﬁes a lot of the possible issues that may
occur with this model. By taking in images that are
trained on our Neural Network, it will return a den-
sity of areas that displays the “important areas” that a
facemask model should look at to identify whether or
not the mask is being worn currently. For example this
model should at least look at our nose, chin and gen-
eral face features to see if the mask is covering a cer-
tain targeted area which can help the model then make
its predictions more understandable to us. Feasibility
otherwise has been historically demonstrated through
the widespread popularity of convolutional neural net-
works, as well as the current speed of real-time ob-
ject detection. We propose to create a website which
showcases not only our model, but highlights the nec-
essary transparency that will ensure further trust in our
work. Ultimately, we would hope to allow individuals
to submit photographs of themselves wearing a mask,
and have our model be able to recognize whether or
not they are wearing it properly. However, other as-
pects of the website would include going further in
depth to our model, any discussions and obstacles in
our model, and ultimately highlight any successes our
model achieves. In short, to be considered a success-
ful model, the outputs should correspond with the cor-
rect wearing of masks and the usage of Grad CAM
should serve as some sort of evidence that the model
is looking at the right areas. Currently, there are sev-
eral models which look at whether faces are correctly
or incorrectly wearing a mask. Although there existslarge datasets with mask face images; there are few
that include whether the mask is actually worn prop-
erly except for a few. One is MaskedFace-Net, which
includes 67,193 images with masks that are worn cor-
rectly, and 66,900 images of masks work incorrectly.
Moreover, this dataset also breaks down the incorrectly
worn masks into why they were deemed “improper,”
such as uncovered nose, mouth, chin, etc and contains
the information needed. As we aim to provide trans-
parency into our model, these speciﬁcities will allow
us to ensure our model comes to a conclusion for the
correct reasons. Another dataset which includes im-
properly worn masks is the Face Mask Detection with
3 classes dataset on Kaggle, which has 853 images
with bounding boxes in PASCAL VOC format. How-
ever, this dataset is far smaller than the MaskedFace-
Net dataset. There are multiple data sources out there
which contain the presence of a mask, such as PyIm-
age Search Reader’s covid-19 face mask detector and
NVIDIA’s face mask detection; however, both do not
go in depth into whether a mask is worn properly or
improperly, which is crucial to the efﬁcacy of a mask
during the covid-19 pandemic. We will most likely uti-
lize the MaskedFace-Net dataset or the Kaggle dataset.","The researchers aim to provide transparency in the field of artificial intelligence by developing a model that can determine if individuals are properly wearing a face mask. They use the Inception ResNet V1 model and the MaskedFace-Net dataset to train their model. They also apply GradCAM to highlight how the model reaches its decision. The model achieves an accuracy of 96% in classifying mask usage. However, there are limitations, such as the dataset only containing blue medical face masks and not including other types of masks. The researchers also discuss the importance of transparency and trust in AI models, especially in high-stakes situations like the Covid-19 pandemic."

Abstract —This report addresses the concern of careless mask
wearing due to the ongoing pandemic, which has caused small
businesses and large businesses alike ﬁnancial problem. As a
result, we tackle this issue by building a face mask detector
that will recognize whether a person is wearing a mask. More
importantly, not only is our face mask detector able to detect
whether a person has a mask on, it can also detect whether
the person is wearing a mask correctly, or with both chin and
nose covered. Our detector was trained on a dataset called
MaskedFace-Net, which contains more than 35000 images, and
was able to ﬁt the training data while performing even better
on the validation and test set. It is able to achieve 88% a 95%
accuracy on training set and both validation set and test set,
respectively.

I. I NTRODUCTION
In recent years, enhanced computational power allows us to
handle data in large amount at unprecedentedly high efﬁciency,
which in turns gives us the opportunity to do task that has
never been done before. For example, in the ﬁeld of computer
vision, researchers have been using deep learning, which is
a method based on neural networks in order to learn from
data, to create algorithm that locates objects and retrieves
their attributes from an image. This approach has obtained
impressive results in numerous computer tasks such as image
classiﬁcation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmenta-
tion. However, using deep learning to conduct computer vision
related tasks has also garnered some criticisms. One criticism
describes neural network as a black box, which basically
means we teach it with some expectations on the output by
feeding them enormous data. However, we do not have any
idea of how it achieves what we want. Therefore, the question
”How does a neural network achieve what it’s supposed to
achieve” is crucial in understanding how does an algorithm
detects objects and its features from an image. This will not
only convincingly make people understand how it works, but
also allow researchers to troubleshoot.
In this project, after building a task-oriented image clas-
siﬁcation algorithm, we speciﬁcally would like to investigate
the problem of how can such algorithm be trusted to give the
correct results. We would like to make sure that the process
through which the neural network is able to produce the outputwe expect is one that is explainable and logical. To paraphrase
it and put it in simpler terms, how can we make sure that an
algorithm can successfully recognize the objects in an image
because of its unique features and not because of something
else is the key question to answer. Approaches to ﬁnding such
answers are also known as ”Explainable AI” methods, which
lies at the core of this report. In summary, the workﬂow of
this project can be described as below:
1) Train a model that will help classify images.
2) Generate performance of the model
3) Implement ”Explainable AI” methods to ensure the
performance of the model is valid and reasonable.
II. C ONTEXT /MOTIVATION
2020 has been a year of tribulations and sufferings. The
COVID-19 pandemic has taken lives of many and is still
widespread across the world. More importantly, many people’s
lives are changed in a drastic manner. For example, to comply
with government laws, many businesses are asked to require
customers to wear masks upon entering a building, and they
have to refuse services for customers who don’t cooperate.
Therefore, to both customer and business owner, it has never
been more important to wear masks in public, especially for
business owners, who need the general public to wear masks
in order for their businesses to survive. As a result, having a
face mask detector that will detect whether a customer has his
mask worn upon entry is crucial to survival of their business.
Therefore, we’ve decided to build a model that will recognize
whether a person in an image is wearing a mask or not.
Previous work on face mask detection mainly dealt with
detecting whether a person has a mask on or not in an
image. For example, Adrian RoseBrock, in his website [1],
had successfully created a face mask detector. However, the
dataset he worked with only consists of 1376 images, which is
fairly small for computer vision tasks. In addition, the dataset
only has images with people wearing masks or not. It doesn’t
contain images where a person is wearing a mask but not
covering his nose or chin. In other words, it doesn’t have
images where a person is wearing a mask improperly. We
believe that this is a deﬁciency that is important to address,
and our model and dataset will take this into account.In this report, we aim to develop an image classiﬁcation
model that will recognize the content of an image and label
it correctly. In addition, to make our model more powerful,
we will provide the model with the ability to detect whether
a person in an image is wearing a mask correctly or not.
As mentioned above, this feature will be particularly useful
due to the fact that a lot of people are wearing their masks
improperly because apparently they ﬁnd trouble breathing.
After ﬁnish building the model, we will check whether the
model is correctly interpreting the results by implementing
Explainable AI methods such as Grad-CAM and Integrated
Gradient, which are two powerful visualizing algorithm that
can validate the workings of our model. Grad-CAM and
Integrated Gradient will be explained in greater detail later.
In summary, our contributions to this report include:
We build a face mask detector that will be put into good
use in light of the pandemic.
We provide the face mask detector with attention to detail
skills that are crucial during the pandemic.
We make sure our model is working the way we want
through Explainable AI methods (Grad-CAM, Integrated
Gradient)
III. D ATASET
Our model will be trained and evaluated on MaskedFace-
Net [2], which contains more than 50000 images, each one of
them with a person in it. The entire dataset is split into three
parts: train, validation, and test. Furthermore, each image is
classiﬁed as either ”correctly masked”, ”incorrectly masked”,
and ”not masked”. Figure 1, 2, and 3 show all three types of
image:
Fig. 1. An image with
correctly masked per-
son
Fig. 2. An image with
incorrectly masked per-
son
Fig. 3. An image with
a person that is not
masked
This multi-label feature allows us to build a model that
is sensitive to improper mask wearing. Table I shows the
statistics of the dataset:
Train Validation Test
Correctly Masked 12362 3090 3863
Incorrectly Masked 12338 3084 3856
Not Masked 12800 3199 4000
Total 37500 9373 11719
TABLE I
STATISTICS OF MASKED FACE-NET
From the table, it can be seen that the subset of the dataset
is distributed equally across all three sets.IV. M ETHODOLOGY
A. Task Formulation
Our classiﬁcation problem can be summarized as follows:
Given an image consisting of pixels I=fx1; x2; :::; x ng,
where xi2I Ris the i-th pixel containing 3 color channels,
and a category Y2fcorrectly masked, incorrectly masked,
not maskedg, we aim to train a model that maps each ItoY
such that the accuracy is maximized.
B. ResNet50
Our ﬁrst step in building a reliable face mask detector is
to build a model that will correctly classify the image. For
our baseline model, we will use a deep residual learning
framework called ResNet50 [3]. The concept of ResNet50
draws from the fact that both the training error and test error
actually increase when a plain deep neural network is added
more layers. Figure 4, which is from the paper, compares the
error from networks with 20 layers and 56 layers.
Fig. 4. Training and testing errors on CIFAR-10 from network with 20 and
56 layers respectively. Notice the network with 56 layers has higher training
and testing error.
When the model becomes much deeper, meaning most of
the features have already been learned, adding an additional
layer will only result in the model trying to map the previous
set of feature to the exact same set of feature. This mapping
is also known as identity mapping, which should be a simple
process. However, at this point the model will tend to over
complicate the process and thus result in high error.
To combat this issue, the authors proposed a novel approach
based on the concept of ”residual block”. ResNet is made up
of residual blocks. A diagram of residual block can be seen
in Figure 5, which is from the paper:
Fig. 5. A diagram of residual block
2A residual block is composed of more than one weight layer,
and is designed in a way that will combat high error due to
more layers being stacked. In a residual block, a method called
skip connection (illustrated as an arc in the ﬁgure) is used so
that, instead of an input xhaving to go through each layer,
it will directly skip some layers to prevent the model over
complicating the process. At the same time, we will still apply
learning to a new xso the F(x)is produced, which represents
small additional feature learned during the mapping. And the
result is obtained by adding F(x)and(x). This way not only
will the over complication problem be avoided, but the model
will learn new feature. Figure 6, which is from the paper,
illustrates the comparison of plain neural network and ResNet:
Fig. 6. Training and testing errors from plain network and ResNet. Notice
that with ResNet, adding more layers result in lower error.
We decide to choose ResNet50 (50 layers) over ResNet18
(18 layers) or any other with fewer layers because we believe
with the feature of residual block and 50 layers, it will discern
the difference between correctly wearing mask and incorrectly
wearing mask without producing higher error than the one
with fewer layers. In addition, since our classiﬁcation task is
a multi-label classiﬁcation task, we will ﬁne tune our model
by adding an additional linear layer that maps the output of
original ResNet50 to a 3 x 1 vector instead of binary results.
C. Grad-CAM Algorithm
Once we ﬁnish building a face mask detector with ResNet50
as its core component and recording its performance, we will
validate its performance with Grad-CAM [4]. Grad-CAM,
short for ”Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping”, is a
technique that overlays a class activation map over the original
image that highlights the important object in the original
image. Figure 7 illustrates the process of producing a class
activation map:
Fig. 7. Process of producing a class activation map in a neural networkIn the ﬁgure, as an image passes through the convolutional
layers, its size gets reduced, but the features learned gets
increased. The result is a series of feature maps, which is
then passed into a GAP (Global Average Pooling) layer. The
GAP layer will transform each feature map into a single
value that best represents each feature. Equation (1) shows the
mathematical formula of obtaining the output of GAP layer:
Fk=1
ZX
iX
jAk
ij (1)
where1
ZP
iP
jis the process of global average pooling,
Ak
ijis the feature map k, and Fkis the global average pooled
output.
Then, the class activation map is created by calculating the
weighted sum of the weighted associated with each feature and
the feature value. Equation (2) shows the formula of obtaining
the weighted sum
Yc=X
kwc
kFk(2)
where wc
kis the weight connecting the kthfeature map with
thecthclass, and Ycis the weighted sum.
Finally, to make a connection between CAM and Grad-
CAM, we will recompute the weight wc
kby pooling the
gradient of weighted sum with respect to the feature value and
apply an activation function ReLU , as shown in Equation (3)
and (4) respectively:
wc
k=X
iX
j@Yc
@Ak
ij(3)
Lc
GradCAM =ReLU (X
kwc
kAk) (4)
TheReLU activation function will replace every negative
value with 0 to emphasize the positive weight, which indicates
that this particular feature is strongly associated with the
important object in the image.
Last but not least, it is worth noting that the map is able
to locate the object in the original object because during the
pooling operation, which aggregates multiple values into a
single value, it is able to locate positive values which associate
with the object the most. Therefore, the location of such values
will be the location of the highlighted object.
We choose Grad-CAM because we believe with proper
training of the model on MaskedFace-Net, our model will
be able to learn important features such as the mask and
a person’s nose, mouth, and chin, all of which will be
highlighted when Grad-CAM is applied.
D. Integrated Gradient
Next, we will also validate our model with Integrated Gradi-
ent [5]. Similar to Grad-CAM, Integrated Gradient is another
visualizing method that detects features that are important in
classifying an image. Integrated Gradient relies on a method
3called ”attribution method”, which, given an input xand a
network function f(x), will assign a score to each feature.
Similar to Grad-CAM, a positive value indicates that the
feature is strong associated with the output , and a negative
value indicates that the feature is weakly associated with the
output. 0 indicates that the feature has no effect on the output.
Figure 8 shows the formula to compute the integrated
gradient:
Fig. 8. Formula of Integrated Gradient
where xiis the input, xi
iis the baseline input, which is
usually a blank or black image meant to represent absence
of feature, and fis the network function. To understand the
formula, we will divide it into 3 steps:
1) Compute the gradient of function output with respect to
feature i
2) Integrate over the gradients to avoid saturation problem
(meaning some features might have small gradients even
if they are important)
3) Multiply the difference from baseline to get the feature
importance score
Integrated Gradient is also an important method to use
because we would like to check if the feature importance score
around the mask is high, which will validate our model’s inner
workings.
V. R ESULT
A. Experiment
The model we speciﬁcally trained the Masked-Face Net
dataset on was a pretrained ResNet50 model with the base
parameters of training on CPU, a batch size of 32, a learning
rate of 0.001, and two epochs. For training the model on a
CPU, the base parameter is set to using the CPU in the case
that the user doesn’t have a GPU in their system, but we
ended up training our model using a GPU due to how much
quicker the training process ﬁnishes. For the batch size of 32,
using a size of 32 is a fairly common value, the importance
of the batch size relates to the number of samples that are
read in at a time, affecting memory, speed, and accuracy of
a model. We mostly decided on using this batch size due
to ﬂuctuations on both accuracy and runtimes when either
increasing or decreasing the batch size. For our learning rate,
we decided to stick with a value of 0.001, the importance of a
learning rate is in regards to tuning the weights to optimize the
loss function, which simpliﬁed, a lower learning rate makes
training more reliable but longer runtime whereas vice versa,
a large learning rate makes training less reliable but shorter
runtimes. We chose this value for the learning rate due to the
same reason as our batch size evaluation, in which this value
performed better and faster than the other common learningrate values of 0.1 and 0.01. We used two epochs to train our
model, which refers to how many times we trained our model
on the entire dataset, so in this case we trained the model on
the dataset twice, since our model takes a fairly long time to
run and the accuracy we gain from running more epochs is
negligible.
B. Performance
After conducting the experiment, the performance of
ResNet50 on training, validation, and testing set from
MaskedFace-Net can be seen in Table II:
Train Validation Test
Correctly Masked 89% 88% 94%
Incorrectly Masked 78% 93% 92%
Not Masked 94% 99% 98%
Total 88% 95% 95%
TABLE II
PERFORMANCE OF FINETUNED RESNET50ONMASKED FACE-NET
Across the sets of data, we are surprised to ﬁnd that
ResNet50 not only ﬁts the training data but also performs well
on both the validation data and training data, both of whose
accuracy are higher than the training data. This is different
from we expected in the beginning, as we thought the model
will have an overﬁtting problem. Instead, it turns out that the
model is able to prevent that. Equally surprising is that the
model did well across different labels. Although the images
with incorrectly masked person have a slightly lower accuracy
than others, it is reasonable due to the fact that to be able to
recognize a person is not wearing a mask requires lots of
features to be detected, not just mask. Also, we are satisﬁed
with the fact that the images with people who are not masked
achieved the highest accuracy, which is totally reasonable as
well because the absence of mask will be very easy for the
model to learn and detect.
Moving on to the visualization of Grad-CAM on our model,
we are also content with the result. Figure 9, 10, and 11, show
the images with correctly masked, incorrectly masked, and not
masked, and for comparison, Figure 12, 13, and 14 show the
Grad-CAM implementation of the images:
Fig. 9. An image with
correctly masked per-
son
Fig. 10. An image with
incorrectly masked per-
son
Fig. 11. An image with
a person that is not
masked
For the image with a correctly masked person, it is evident
that the model has learned the feature ”mask” because in
Figure 12, the heat map is generated with the emphasis on
the mask, which is a desirable result. For the image with a
4Fig. 12. Grad-CAM re-
sults of Figure 9
Fig. 13. Grad-CAM re-
sults of Figure 10
Fig. 14. Grad-CAM re-
sults of Figure 11
incorrectly masked person, it is also obvious that the model
has kept its focus on the mask. However, the heat map also
has successfully focused near the area between the edge of
the mask and the person’s nose, indicating that the model has
learned the feature ”philtrum” and ”nose”. Last but not least,
for the image with a person that is not masked, with the heat
map covering the mouth and chin of the person, it is possible
that the model has learned the feature ”mouth” and ”chin” and
is able to ﬁgure out that if both mouth and chin are exposed,
then it’s impossible for a person to have a mask on, be it
correctly or incorrectly. In summary, judging from the results
of Grad-CAM from each of the label, the high accuracy is
attributed to the model’s correct learning of the feature present
in the images.
As for Integrated Gradient, Figure 15, 16, and 17 show the
results of the implementation:
Fig. 15. Implementation of Integrated Gradient on Figure 9
In the 2-by-3 image matrix, from left to right the top
row represents the original image, the gradient overlay, and
gradient. The bottom row represents the original image, the
integrated gradient overlay, and integrated gradient. We are
interested in the bottom right image. The pixel in green means
that the model believes this pixel is important in predicting the
output.
In Figure 15, most of the pixels around the mask are high-
lighted, meaning the model has learned to predict this image
as ”correctly masked” because of the presence of the mask. In
Figure 16, most of the pixels highlighted are scattered around
the image. Our guess is that perhaps the Integrated Gradient
has also recognized that the model has learned various other
features as well, such as eyes and ears. This is likely due to
Fig. 16. Implementation of Integrated Gradient on Figure 10
Fig. 17. Implementation of Integrated Gradient on Figure 11
the powerful nature in learning features from ResNet50. In
Figure 17, the pixels that are in green constitute area such as
the edge of the face which connects to the cap, the node, and
the upper lip. This is a very interesting case because not only
does it learn other features such nose and edge of the forehead,
but it also pays attention to the lip which is important in
distinguishing whether a mask is worn. Once again, we believe
this is happening because ResNet50 is powerful enough to
recognize each facial feature, which includes the upper lip.
In summary, while the results of integrated gradient isn’t as
straightforward as the Grad-CAM, we are still able to connect
the result with the success of our model.
Overall, we are satisﬁed with the high accuracy of the
model, and the visualization results which validate our model’s
approach to classifying the images.
C. Error Analysis
In this section, we would like to provide an example where
our model has failed to predict the image correctly. Figure 18
shows the original image.
This image is classiﬁed as correctly masked. However, our
model has classiﬁed it as incorrectly masked. We believe that
this is likely due to the fact that some part of the person’s
nose is not fully covered, resulting in our model detecting the
presence of the nose and labeling it as incorrectly masked.
Next we’ll look at the results of Grad-CAM and Integrated
5Fig. 18. An image where our model has incorrectly classiﬁed
Gradient on this particular image. Figure 19 and 20 show the
result:
Fig. 19. Grad-CAM result on the misclassiﬁed image
Fig. 20. Integrated Gradient result on the misclassiﬁed image
Looking at Grad-CAM result, we observe that the heat
map is placed correctly onto the mask. However, it is also
noticeable the area of the map has extended to the nose
area, which indicate the when considering whether this image
contains a person with correctly worn mask or incorrectly
worn mask, the presence of nose is a major factor in assisting
the model to make the decision, thus resulting in the model
predicting this image as incorrectly masked.
Now looking at the result of integrated gradient, though not
very easy to locate, we discover that the cheek of this person is
being highlighted. When a person is wearing a mask, it’s very
unlikely for this person’s cheek to expose, unless this person
is smiling. In this case, the person is smiling. Therefore, we
deduce that perhaps our model might not be able to classify
an image where a person is smiling but still has his maskproperly worn. This is something deﬁnitely worth considering
in the future for further development and reﬁnement of the
model.
D. Discussion and Future Improvement
As mentioned in the previous section, the error example
demonstrates that a person smiling might result in model’s
failed attempt to correctly classify the image. Therefore we
deﬁnitely need to take this into consideration if we want to
further improve our model. Some possible approaches include
adding more layers to ﬁne tune the model or training the model
with more data, especially images like this.
Although we mentioned the addition of other models in our
code, there are also other improvements that can be made.
Currently one caveat of implementation is the requirement of
an image to make a classiﬁcation. That being said, an improve-
ment would deﬁnitely be to create this classiﬁcation through a
video setting due to settings in which people constantly move
around making this task difﬁcult to accomplish. However, the
ability to adapted for motion capture is currently far beyond
the scope of any of the author’s capabilities. To able to do so
will require people who are skilled in IT.
VI. C ONCLUSION
In this report, we address a current concern shared by people
across the world and point out a common bad habit practiced
by the general public, which is wearing mask incorrectly
and has jeopardized a lot of business. Then we attempt to
mitigate this issue by proposing a face mask detector that
will help business owners comply with laws and ensure the
survival of their business. Our approach to building such a
face mask detector is successful and is proven to work in the
intended way. We hope that more face mask detectors can be
implemented so that business owner can survive in this rather
difﬁcult time and that people can protect not only themselves
but also others.

Abstract
Image captioning models are complex because they
work on object detection as well as caption generation.
When these models fail it is hard to understand where
and why they fail. To explain how an image captioning
model works, we use attention maps to visualize the
relationships between generated words and objects in
an image. Moreover, we utilize an image perturbation
model to alter regions of images to see how the cap-
tions change and to test the robustness of our model
by measuring the similarity between captions gener-
ated before and after the altering of the image.
1. Introduction
Image captioning is an interesting area to investi-
gate because it is a combination of object detection
and natural language processing, which corresponds to
the application of convolutional neural network (CNN)
and recurrent neural network (RNN). A good image
captioning model mimics the action of a human that it
is able to understand and describe what an image in-
cludes. In the ﬁeld of deep learning, attention maps
are a widely used technique. With attention maps, the
model can learn which parts in the image it needs to
pay more attention to when generating the next word
in the caption. In our project, we implemented atten-
tion maps as a tool to understand why the model made
the predictions it did. At the same time, it is impor-
tant that an image captioning model is robust, whichmeans it could make reasonable adjustments to the
caption it generates when the input image is changed.
In our project, we also implemented an image pertur-
bation model that alters the input image to evaluate
the robustness of our image captioning model. We
used information from the image perturbation model
along with the attention maps to evaluate each objects’
importance to the original caption generated from the
model.
2. Data
At the very beginning, we wanted to train the image
captioning model with the combination of the COCO
dataset and the Visual Genome dataset. After we real-
ized it is hard to combine them and we had little use
for the relational data in the Visual Genome dataset,
we decided to only use the COCO dataset to train this
model. The reason why we use the COCO dataset
in the end is that COCO is large and comprehensive
enough to train our model. It contains 330k images
and 5 captions per image. We use the CelebA (Celeb-
Faces Attributes Dataset) dataset to train our image
perturbation model. CelebA is a large-scale face at-
tributes dataset with more than 200K celebrity images,
each with 40 attribute annotations. The images in this
dataset cover large pose variations and background
clutter.
13. Methods
This model can be separated into three parts: encod-
ing, decoding, and attention. The ﬁrst part, encoding,
we use a CNN model, which takes an image as input
and outputs the multiple learned channels that encode
the features of the image. The second part, decoding,
we part use an RNN model, which uses the encoded
data from the CNN as a starting point to generate a
sequence of words. Lastly, we use attention during
the decoding process allows the RNN model to learn
where it should pay more attention when generating
the next words. We can later use this learned attention
to generate attention maps to add interpretability to our
model.
In the image perturbation process, our model
chooses an object from the raw image, creates a mask
to indicate where the object in located, then outputs
a new image in which the object it removed through
generative inpainting.
After integrating the image captioning and image
perturbation model, we generated a caption from the
raw image and a new caption for each object we re-
moved from the raw image. Then we calculated the
similarity between the original and counterfactual im-
age. To calculate the similarity, we embedded these
two captions into vectors with a pre-trained BERT
model and then calculated the cosine sentence distance
between them. We expected to see that the more im-
portant the removed object is, the larger distance we
get or similarly the more the caption changes.
3.1. Attention Map
In order to better understand the caption genera-
tion process of a CNN-RNN image captioning model,
we generated attention maps for each word generated
by our model. We used deterministic “soft” attention
as the research paper Show, Attend, Tell does. This
differs from stochastic “hard” attention as during the
learning process we do not sample attention locations
each time but can instead take the expectation of a con-
text vector. A beneﬁt of using deterministic attention
is that the whole model is smooth and differentiable
so we can use standard back-propagation to train the
model.
Using these attention maps we can see where the
model is looking when it outputs a given word andwith this information we can better understand the
model especially when it makes mistakes. In our ﬁrst
example we can see the model captions the image well.
Looking at the attention map it is clear the model is
looking at the correct sections of the images as when it
generates the word “dog” its attention is on the dog’s
body and when it generates the word “toilet” its atten-
tion is on the toilet.
Figure 1: Example 1
In this second example, we see the model again cap-
tions correctly and looks at reasonable parts of the im-
ages when generating words. When the word “men”
is generated the attention is focused on sections of the
men in the image and when the word “soccer” is gen-
erated, the attention is clearly on the soccer ball.
2Figure 2: Example 2
An example of when our model does poorly but is
explainable is shown below. One of the captions for
this image is “a table with some cellphones and other
objects”. The model gets the part about the table cor-
rect but incorrectly assumes that this is the contents
of the purse. However, this assumption makes sense
as the contents of a purse are usually an assortment
of small objects like the image and furthermore, the
model is clearly paying attention to the correct sec-
tions of the image and the cause of the miscaptioning
is not a lack of attention.
Figure 3: Example 3
Lastly, we see that model can sometimes perform
poorly with no easily discernible explanation. In the
below image the boy is neither sitting nor looking at
his phone. When the model generates the word “sit-
ting” the attention is on the boy’s body possibly in-
dicating his stance looks similar to someone sitting.
However, when the word “phone” is generated, it
makes very little sense as to how regions of the boy’s
hood could be mistaken for a phone. We can extrap-
olate the possibilities of why this image was miscap-
tioned but it seems the model cannot always produce a
reason explanation, through attention maps, of why an
image was miscaptioned.
Figure 4: Example 4
3.2. Image Perturbation
Once we produce the attention maps for a given im-
age and its produced caption, we extend on this idea
by removing an object from the source image and re-
generating the produced caption to assess how it dif-
fers from the original. The method we choose to re-
move objects from an image is called Generative In-
painting. Given an input image and a binary mask,
generative in-painting uses a pre-trained gated convo-
lutional neural network to remove the part of the image
in the mask and replace it with the model’s best guess
of what the original image would look like without the
masked portion. For example we can take an image of
several surfers riding a wave, draw a white mask im-
age where one of the surfers is located, then remove
that surfer from the image by inferring what the back-
ground image should look like.
3Figure 5: Raw Image
Figure 6: Input Image
Figure 7: Output Image
In the examples given above, we are taking a raw
image from the COCO data set, generating a white bi-
nary mask to place over one of the surfers, then remov-
ing that surfer from the image through our pre-trained
generative model. The goal here is to produce a coun-
terfactual, or an image with slight modiﬁcations from
the original, in order to assess how much our caption
changes without a given object. We expect that objects
in the image more pertinent to the caption will have a
greater impact on the counterfactual’s generated cap-
tion when removed from the image.
There are some limitations to producing counter-
factuals with generative in-painting, and some ques-
tions we must tackle before automating the production
of counterfactuals. First off, we struggled to produce
realistic-looking counterfactuals when the object was
too large, as seen in ﬁgures 8-10 below.
Figure 8: Raw Image
4Figure 9: Input Image
Figure 10: Output Image
As we see in the three ﬁgures above, the image per-
turbation model struggles to accurately remove objects
that take up a large portion of the image. Our solution
to this problem would be to restrict the size of the ob-
jects we remove to a speciﬁed fraction of the image’s
size, or to skip the image altogether if this cannot be
done.
Another issue we face is in choosing which objects
to remove. Our current method entails removing ob-
jects at random, based on the list of objects provided to
us in the image’s annotation. However, this may lead
to us removing objects that aren’t truly important to the
image and will have little affect on the generated cap-
tion. To address this issue, we will try and produce animportance metric for each object we remove by com-
paring not only the difference in generated captions,
but also the difference in attention maps produced by
the counterfactual and original image. We hope to ﬁnd
that in objects that are more important to the image,
we will have a greater change in captions produced, as
well as a quantiﬁable difference in the attention maps
generated.
4. Results
4.1. Model Performance
In general, our image captioning model has good
performance evaluated by the BLEU metric:
Table 1: BLEU Score of Image Captioning Model
BLEU-1 BLEU-2 BLEU-3 BLEU-4
70.0 52.3 38.2 27.3
These BLEU scores are slighly different than those
achieved by the ”soft” attention model Show, Attend,
Tell. The similarity of these scores indicate a success-
ful emulation of their model. We attribute the slight
difference in BLEU scores to using different data par-
titions for the training, validation, and test sets and
the natural variation of training models with different
hyper-parameters.
4.2. Determining Object Importance
In order to determine how important an object is to
the overall caption, we compare what the caption looks
like with and without that object. We can make this
comparison quantitatively using a pre-trained BERT
model that converts sentences into vectors, then com-
pare those vectors using the cosine similarity metric.
Here is an example of our counterfactual changing
the produced caption, as well as attention maps:
5Figure 11: Raw Image and Perturbated Image
Figure 12: Raw Attention Map
Figure 13: Attention Map after Perturbation
We produce a new image, caption, and attention
map for each annotation in the image, then compute
our BERT distances between the counterfactual cap-
tion and raw image caption, and compare the results.
For reference, a BERT distance of 0 means the sen-
tences are identical, and a BERT distance of 1 means
the sentences are conceptually the opposite as deemed
by the word embedding produced by the pre-trained
BERT model.
Table 2: BERT Distance Results
Annotation ID Counterfactual Caption BERT Distance from Original
Skateboard A man and a dog playing with a frisbee 0.10
Dog A man kneeling down next to a dog on a sidewalk 0.07
Truck A man sitting on the ground with a skateboard 0.04
Human A dog laying on the ground next to a truck 0.08
The table above allows us to create a visualization
of the relative importances of each object to the cap-
tion, with the assumption that the difference between
the counterfactual image’s caption and the original im-
age’s caption speak to the importance of that object to
the image captioning model.
6Figure 14: Object Importance Visualization
In Figure 14, we shade each object with it’s corre-
sponding importance as valued by how much its cor-
responding counterfactual affected the original cap-
tion. This example alone brings up many interesting
questions and insights about how our image caption-
ing model functions, and areas where it may improve
based on our intuition. Firstly, we ﬁnd that, in this im-
age, the size of the annotation doesn’t correlate to the
amount with which the caption is affected. In-fact, the
smallest object, the skateboard, produced the greatest
difference in caption. This suggests that not all parts
of the image are treated equally and that our model is
encoding more relevant parts of the image to produce
its caption. Second, we may question why certain ob-
jects are more important than others, and whether or
not this matches our intuition. For example, one may
expect the objects in the foreground to be most rel-
evant to the caption, yet in Figure 14, the truck in the
background has a higher importance score than the dog
in the foreground. This can lead to many interesting
questions about the biases our model contains, such as
how prevalent each object is in the training dataset, or
how often that object is the focus of the image’s cap-
tion. Lastly, using BERT distance as an importance
score is only one way of thinking about how impor-
tant an object is to the caption produced by an imagecaptioning model; there are numerous other methods
with which one can determine this importance. An-
other method could, for example, compare the atten-
tion maps produced by each counterfactual, either the
map for the same word or with all the attention maps
added together, to determine what parts of the image
the model sees as important before and after the in-
painting. Overall, we hope that this tool for visualizing
object importance can provide a framework of knowl-
edge about image captioning models that will lead to
further research and questions about possible improve-
ments to image captioning.
5. Related Work
For the image captioning section, we implemented
the model based on the paper: Show, Attend and Tell:
Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Atten-
tion.
For the image perturbation section, we imple-
mented the model with Contextual Attention and
Gated Convolution (Link to the repo we based on:
https://github.com/JiahuiYu/generativeinpainting).
For the caption similarity comparison part, we use
the pre-trained BERT word embedding model to em-
bed the captions into vectors.
6. Conclusion
We trained our own image captioning model with
the COCO dataset and evaluated the model with BLEU
metric. With the image captioning model, we gener-
ated attention maps to visualize and explain to the au-
dience how a caption is generated by our model step
by step. We also implemented our image perturba-
tion model and trained it with the COCO dataset. It
has decent performance on removing an object from
an image and reﬁlling it. With the image perturba-
tion model, we investigated how an caption can be
changed if an object is removed from the raw image.
Furthermore, we investigated and visualized the object
importance by assigning an importance score to each
object in an image. In the future, we want to make our
model detect adversarial and see how much the caption
7changes. We also plan to add a segmentation predic-
tion model to eliminate the need for pre-deﬁned anno-
tations. We hope our work will let more people know
about Explainable AI.

Abstract
Many advanced algorithms, speciﬁcally deep
learning models, are considered “black box”
to human understanding. Transparency to in-
trprete such models has become a key obsta-
cle which prevents such algorithms from being
put into practical use. Although algorithms,
such as GradCam, are invented to provide
visual explanations from deep networks via
gradient-based localization, they do not pro-
vide details of how the models reached their
ﬁnal decision step by step in detail. The goal
of this project is to provide more interpretabil-
ity to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
models by combining Grad-CAM with Neu-
ral Backed Decision Trees (NBDTs), and pro-
vide visual explanations with detailed decision
making process of CNN models. This project
demonstrates the potential and limitations of
jointly applying Grad-CAM and NBDTs on
snake classiﬁcation.
1 Introduction
Deep learning models have become more preva-
lent in both image recognition and prediction tasks.
While these models have shown breakthroughs
with high performances in accomplishing these pre-
viously computationally impossible tasks, users
have found it hard to trust the outcomes of these
algorithms as the underlying mechanism is opaque.
This trust issue makes the explainability of deep
learning models vital.
Some approaches already exist to address how deep
learning models reach to its outcomes. In image
recognition, Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping ) makes CNN-based models
more interpretable by generating heat maps that
highlight signiﬁcant regions that lead to ﬁnal deci-
sions.
However, Grad-CAM might fail to produce the
right outcome even if the distinctive parts of theimage are highlighted. The limitation suggests
the need for better approaches to open the ‘black
box’ of deep learning models, which leads to Neu-
ral Backed Decision Trees (NBDT). NBDTs are
modiﬁed hierarchical classiﬁers that use trees con-
structed in weight-space (Wan et al. 2020). NBDTs
enable visualizing each decision by generating a
hierarchy tree. This project uses NBDTs and Grad-
CAMS to explain CNN predictions on snakes’
species and venomous quality. There are two rea-
sons this project chose to combine NBDTs and
Grad-CAMs. First of all, snakes that are highly
similar visually can have minor distinctive features
that determine their species, such as patterns and
head shapes. Second, snakes’ diversity makes itself
an excellent choice to perform NBDT and Grad-
CAM because they will show the whole classiﬁca-
tion process from a bigger species to a subspecies.
Besides the reasons above, the project has valid
applications in real life. Wild snakes are prevalent
on mountains, and hikers have high possibilities to
encounter them. A genuine snake classiﬁer would
provide useful information to hikers about whether
the snake is venomous or not; thus, they can avoid
the snake if a certain dangerous species emerges.
2 Data
Our dataset is from a challenge on AICrowd . This
challenge has 4 rounds of data. In the training pro-
cess, this project initially planned to focus on the
third round of data, which includes the most image
data and training labels (85 different species across
103 countries on 6 continents; but given the limi-
tations of our computing resources, the ﬁrst round
of data was chosen, which includes 45 classes of
images and no geographical data.
In the process of EDA, the snake pictures fall
roughly into three categories: the snake blends in
the natural background with its patterns; the snakeon a distinct background; the snake appears with
something else, like a hand). Grad-CAM was then
used to see how it applies to those three different
categories of images.
However, one difﬁculty is that some snakes can
have different pattern features in their juvenile form
vs. their adult forms, which can impact our model
performances, given that the model might mistake
them for two different species. Also, to adapt to the
natural environment, some non-venomous snakes
evolved to mimic the look of venomous snakes.
According to the article Deadly snakes or just pre-
tending? The evolution of mimicry, the author
stated that more than 150 species of coral snakes
showed mimicacy of venomous patterns .1
In the picture above, the left one is an non-
1

Snakes
venomous mimic of the right one (venomous).
Such a tendency can have a negative impact on
the classiﬁcation.
3 Methods
3.1 GradCAM

Figure 2: Grad-CAM Network
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
(Grad-CAM) is a class discriminative localization
tool in classiﬁcation tasks. It uses the gradients
of any target concept (say ‘dog’ in a classiﬁcation
network or a sequence of words in a captioning net-
work) ﬂowing into the ﬁnal convolutional layer to
produce a coarse localization map highlighting the
1https://phys.org/news/2016-05-deadly-snakes-evolution-

concept. In this task, Grad-CAM is used to localize
the snake’s position and pattern in the image.3
3.2 Neural-Backed Decision Trees
3.2.1 Induced Hierarchy Tree
4
Figure 3: Induced Hierarchy Tree Process
Neural Backed Decision Trees produce an in-
duced hierarchy tree by ﬁrst loading the weights
of a pre-trained model’s ﬁnal fully connected layer,
with weight matrix W in R D ×K. Then it takes rows
wk in W and for each leaf node’s weight it normal-
izes and averages each pair of leaf nodes for the
parents’ weight. Last but not least, for each succes-
sive ancestor, it averages all leaf node weights in
its subtrees. That average is the ancestor’s weight.
Here, the ancestor is the root, so its weight is the
average of all leaf weights w1, w2, w3, w45.
NBDT uses Wordnet to label decision tree nodes.
In general, it is a hierarchy of nouns. To assign
WordNet meaning to nodes, the earliest common
ancestor is computed for all leaves in a subtree.
6
Figure 4: Example Hierarchy Tree
For example, this induced hierarchy tree is able
to show how NBDTs classiﬁes an object from ver-
tebrate to cat or dog (ancestor node to child node).
In the scope of this paper, this WordNet method is
3See footnote 2
5See footnote 4expected to produce a tree where each node rep-
resents a subdivision of a larger division of snake
species.
3.2.2 Tree Supervision Loss
7
Figure 5: Loss formula
Though cross entropy loss separates represen-
tatives of each node, it actually cannot separate
representatives for each inner node. Thus, we com-
bined cross entropy loss with a tree supervision
loss: Soft Tree Loss and Hard Tree Loss over the
class distribution of path probabilities.
Dnbdt = set of path probabilities for each node,
where label is the probability distribution of the
truth labels.
t = original loss’ weights at a given epoch
!t = softTreeloss/hardTreeloss’ coefﬁcients at
a given epoch
3.2.3 Soft Tree Loss vs. Hard Tree Loss
8
Figure 6: Hard Tree vs. Soft Tree
A. Hard: is the classic “hard” oblique decision
tree. Each node picks the child node with the
largest inner product, visits that node next, con-
tinues until a leaf.
B. Soft: is the “soft” variant, where each node
simply returns probabilities, as normalized inner
products, of each child. For each leaf, the model
computes the probability of its path to the root and
then picks the leaf with the highest probability.
C. Hard Supervision Loss vs. Soft Supervision
Loss: In the picture above, assume w4 is the correct
class. With hard inference, the mistake at the root
(red) is irrecoverable. However, with soft inference,
the highly-uncertain decisions at the root and at w2
are superseded by the highly certain decision at w3
(green). This means the model can still correctly
pick w4 despite a mistake at the root. In short, softinference can tolerate mistakes in highly uncertain
decisions.9
However, understanding which one will perform
better for this project is hard to predict without ap-
plying this, because the scientiﬁc names of snakes
do not follow a traditional invertebrate - vertebrate
or instrument- living creature pattern. So the model
used in this project was ﬁne-tuned with both losses
to test which one would perform better.
4 Models
The baseline classiﬁcation starts with a Densenet
model trained over 15 epochs (as its loss gener-
ally converged around the 8th epoch) . In terms
of performance, it reached a F-score of 0.495 on
validation data and accuracy of 0.66 on validation
data.
The CNN based model was transformed to Neu-
ral Backed Decision Trees (NBDTs) by ﬁne tuning
the base model with Soft Supervision Tree Loss
and Hard Supervision Tree Loss (separately, as to
compare them with each other). For image process-
ing, a random 224*224 pixel crop, rotation, and ﬂip
were used to decrease model’s dependency on cer-
tain position or patterns, thus to increase validation
accuracy.
However, one difﬁculty encountered was some
pictures were corrupted and thus not able to con-
tribute to training; these were removed initially
before training.
Last but not least, a neural network dropout was
used, a classic technique to counter the effect of
overﬁtting. It simulates a sparse activation from a
given layer, which in turn, encourages the network
to learn a sparse representation as a side-effect. As
such, it may be used as an alternative to activity reg-
ularization for encouraging sparse representations
in autoencoder models10. In doing so, the train-
ing process can be noisy and randomly increases
or decreases the responsibility of a node to the
succeeding node. Yet this situation might impact
the training accuracy, it can increase the valida-
tion accuracy; in other words, it helps increase the
generalization of our model.

5.1 Grad-CAM
Grad-CAM was applied to three different snake
pictures with different features. The ﬁrst category
includes pictures where snakes blend in with the
background. The second category includes pictures
where snakes differ from the background. The
third category includes pictures where snakes ap-
pear with other objects, like hands. Grad-CAM
performed well on localizing the target object.

5.2 Neural-Backed Decision Tree Hierarchy
The Decision Tree Hierarchy NBDTs produced did
not meet up the initial expectations. The tree’s hier-
archy was expected to have nodes with the snake’s
scientiﬁc names. However, the hierarchy produced
did not have those scientiﬁc names. One possible
explanation for this failure was that the induced
hierarchy was based on WordNet. Since snake’s
scientiﬁc names are large latin instead of common
everyday words, WordNet could not support pro-
ducing this induced hierarchy.
5.3 Model Performance
Three different training methods were used. The
ﬁrst one was a baseline DenseNet model. In the

preprocessing process, the images were center-
cropped and normalized to [0.485, 0.456, 0.406],
[0.229, 0.224, 0.225] size. The result accuracy
was 0.6617 and the F1 Score was 0.516. The sec-
ond one was Neural Backed Decision Tree trained
within around 15 epochs with Soft Supervision
Tree Loss. It reached an accuracy of 0.4450 and an
F1 Score of 0.302. Last but not least, the Neural
Backed Decision Tree trained with Hard Supervi-
sion Tree Loss in around 15 epochs performed the
best. It reached an accuracy of 0.6850 and F1 Score
of 0.542. In the training process, Soft NBDTs con-
verged around epoch 6 and Hard NBDTs converged
around epoch 10. Those results were expected.
Figure 11: Training Loss
6 Discussion
Overall, the visual explanation produced by Grad-
CAM suggests that it is capable of speciﬁcallyFigure 12: Training Accuracy
Figure 13: F1 Score
highlighting the entire body of snakes in all three
categories of data ( when snakes blend with the
background, when snakes stand out from the back-
ground, when another object presents with the
snakes). This exempliﬁes the idea that the model
is working correctly, as it can highlight the key
parts of the image precisely. Furthermore, Grad-
CAM also has the ability to feature scale patterns
of snakes considered to be crucial in species identi-
ﬁcation. While not able to display detailed decision
making process, Grad-CAM offers primal insight
on how a snake is classiﬁed by a CNN model.
While classiﬁcation implementation was suc-
cessful, an induced hierarchy tree that provides the
model’s decision-making process was not success-
ful. WordNet is the database that was employed to
assign meaning to splits in the decision tree. How-
ever, while WordNet contains most of the everyday
words, the dictionary was not expected to include
scientiﬁc names(WordNet)11. This limitation po-
tentially prevented the generation of a meaningful
induced hierarchy tree.
Additionally, some problems came with the orig-
inal algorithm’s design in using agglomerative clus-
11https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordNettering. Agglomerative clustering is a hierarchical
approach to pair nodes - however classiﬁcation, es-
pecially when it comes to animals, is not strictly
binary. Perhaps an algorithm that clusters based
on weight similarity could be used to try and pair
nodes in a non-binary fashion - though further re-
search and testing would be needed.
Failure to produce interpretability with the hier-
archy tree also caused obstacles to understanding
why classiﬁcation accuracy of this project varied
more than claimed in prior works. To improve this
project, a lexical database of scientiﬁc names is
required to establish interpretability for NBDT. An-
other limitation of this project was that only 20GB
of the data is used in this task. In the future, more
Data should be aggregated into the project to gen-
erate stronger results.
In real life, a successful implementation that
solved the difﬁculties above would be an useful
application for hikers, wild animal lovers, and even
scientiﬁc researchers. For hikers, they can have an
app on their phone that is able to take a picture of
a snake and produce its identiﬁcation immediately
and even lists resources such as anti-venom, if dan-
ger happens. The app can link with hospitals and
clinics to establish a network that can address dan-
gerous situations instantly. In addition, more data
from scientiﬁc researchers will enable the model to
perform better.

Rui Zheng - A15046475 Background As the use of
neural networks advances into more pivotal appli-
cations such as medicine and economics, the need
to trust them is higher than ever. And although
interpretability algorithms for image classiﬁcation
networks exist, such as Grad-CAM’s “heat map”
approach, they fail when models look at the right
parts of the image, but classify them incorrectly.
Additionally, they offer no insights into the deci-
sions that the model makes, and only display where
the model is looking in an image. This is where
Neural Backed Decision Trees (NBDT) come in.
NBDTs are modiﬁed hierarchical classiﬁers that
use trees constructed in weight-space (Wan et al.
2020). With this model, users are able to look at the
decisions a model makes, and thus remove some
of the “black box” that neural networks impose.
A prime example of using neural-backed decision
trees would be for animal classiﬁcation, as the splits
for determining whether an animal is one species
or the other can be contextualized as a multi-class
problem (i.e does this snake have a certain pattern?
If yes then check for head shape, etc). This project
also aims to be able to classify snakes based on
imagery data, then use that species classiﬁcation
as a method to determine if the snake is venomous.
Then, NBDT will be applied to understand the de-
cisions the model made. Additionally, the need to
identify snakes by species, and thus give insight
into whether it’s venomous can be a valuable tool
to hikers and herpetologists alike. The diversity
of snakes makes itself a good choice to perform
NBDT and Grad-CAM because they will be able
to show the whole classiﬁcation process from a big-
ger species to a subspecies. Last but not least, we
can determine if the snake in a picture is venomous
based on species prediction, which will be more
accurate than solely looking at the head shape of
the snake (some non-venomous snakes can ﬂatten
their head shape to appear like a venomous one).
Our question for this project is: How can NBDTs
be used to validate CNN predictions for classifying
whether a snake is venomous? Data: In terms of
data, there is a dataset containing about 250,000
RGB images of snakes, labeled with their species,provided by the Institute of Global Health Life-
CLEF on AICrowd (AICrowd is an online platform
in which data scientists gather to solve real-world
problems). As the task is a multi- class classiﬁca-
tion problem, using imagery data to predict labels is
CNNs’ specialty. One concern is processing power,
but with datahub and cuda core utilization, process-
ing speed will be much faster. After predicting the
dataset for each image, existing reptile databases
can be used to scrape information about whether a
species is venomous. Gap Analysis: Similarly to
Q1, GradCAM will be used but NBDTs are the big
pull of this project. The project looks to explain the
decisions neural networks make, opposed to mak-
ing sure the network can highlight key points of
an image. On a scale outside of the class, no work
has been done analyzing snake classiﬁcation using
NBDTs, though others have attempted to classify
snakes based on imagery data before. Output: The
output for the project will be a report based on
the prediction accuracy for CNN and NBDT and
a decision tree graph of the whole classiﬁcation
decision-making process; plus, we will include the
Grad-CAM saliency map pictures for several test
snake images.

1 Abstract
We propose the creation of a full-stack website as an extension of the AutoPhrase
algorithm and text analysis to help the non-tech users understand their text
eciently. Also, we provide a notebook with one specic data set as an example
to the users.
2 Introduction
Phrase mining - the extraction of high-quality phrases from a large input corpus
- is an important and interesting skill to analyze text data sets with. It identies
the phrases instead of an uni-gram word, which provides a much more under-
standing of the text. For instance, \support vector machine"" should be dened
as a high-quality phrase instead in machine learning scientic writing. There is a
strong connection between uni-gram \support"", \vector"" and \machine"" and it
is much more meaningful than any of those uni-grams with high frequency of the
phrase appearing in the writing (Jialu 1). Phrase mining has various applica-
tions such as information extraction, topic modeling, etc. It also plays an impor-
tant role in domains like market research, public sentiment and fraud detection.
Raw frequency-based phrase mining has many limitations, most majorly that
recurring word sequences may not form meaningful phrases (or be structured),
which causes semantic ambiguity and misleading quality assessment. The pur-
pose of this project is to help non-tech users understand their text eciently by
utilizing AuoPhrase algorithms and other text analysis techniques and produce
the results by concise steps. AutoPhrase has a better performance in mining
phrases from a large corpus with minimizing human labeling eort with domain
independence in any provided knowledge base languages. AutoPhrase is useful,
interesting and well-structured for real-world applications. But it is not directly
helpful for non-tech users/common people in implementing. Therefore, in the
website development, we generate 3 front webs and one back-end on running
1AutoPhrase and producing results. The users only need to upload their les
and the process will run automatically to generate word clouds and the phrase
text with the weight values. In the notebook, there is more text analysis in
the forms of texts and charts to help them understand the text visually. Our
project mainly includes:
•A web application, which requires the user to upload their own input le
(in txt format) and automatically produce the results
•A visualization and dynamic dashboard for relevant outputs on the website
•Available to append their knowledge base the default knowledge base on

In the previous quarter, we understood the algorithm behind the AutoPhrase
and created an application of it. However, it is hard for a non-technical person
to apply this method into their real life, because they need to implement some
code in the terminal, writing the bash les, or python code, etc., which is not
helpful in understanding the text. Furthermore, the nal output of the Au-
toPhrase only generates the phrases with descending values, which will confuse
the users. Therefore, we decided to generate a web to solve the above prob-
lems. To make more people understand AutoPhrase and their text within data
science techniques, we decided to build a web visualization and add more other
text analysis techniques to generate charts, word-cloud, text presentation with
explanations for the results. The users can upload their own text, and see the
progress of the AutoPhrase steps on the screen. Lastly, all of the visualizations
and text results are shown in front of them.
4 Methods
1. AutoPhrase (Automated Phrase Mining):
Most of the phrase mining methods are expensive and depend on a lot of human
labeling eorts to train the model in a specic domain and language. However,
AutoPhrase has a better performance in mining phrases from a large corpus with
minimizing human labeling eort with domain independence in any provided
knowledge base languages(Jingbo 1). It performs based on Robust Positive-Only
Distant Training and POS-Guided Phrasal Segmentation methods to compute
the values of phrase quality.
2Figure 1: Outline of Automated Phrase Mining using Robust positive only
distant training and POS-guide phrasal segmentation
AutoPhrase method requires inputs as text corpus sequence of words in
one language and a knowledge base le and gets the ranked quality value of
phrases in descending order as outputs. The knowledge base is a le of the
term database, which used to distinguish the common terms. In this method,
the default knowledge base is from the phrases on Wikipedia. The AutoPhrase
method contains data cleaning steps in the method as data processing. For the
further steps, it uses the phase mining methods including tokenizing and POS-
tagging. It splits the text input into a smaller unit and to mark up the words in
the text to prepare the phrases. Later, it applies phrasal segmentation to break
a sequence/sentence into a semantic unit (a word/phrase). To compute the
quality of candidate phrases from a raw corpus, AutoPhrase depends on knowl-
edge bases to create a clean and free positive phrase pool in distance supervision
to replace experts provided labels. Then, it implements the noisy reduction in
the noisy negative pool and applies the POS-Guided phrasal segmentation to
meet the requirement of high-quality phrases. At the end, it produces outputs
of ranked lists with the decreasing quality phrases.
2. Web Development:
In the front web development, we built three front webs. We utilize hyper
text markup language (HTML) to structure and design in a web browser with
the assistance of Cascading style sheeting (CSS), which is the style presentation
and JavaScript (JS) enabled to interactive web pages. Furthermore, we utilized
LayUI as a front-end UI framework to make it more organized. It is usable for
users to upload their own les, the knowledge base, reading the processing steps
of AutoPhrase and some text and word cloud visualization at the end.
In the back-end web development, we build the back-end based on the Apache
Tomcat, which is the HTTP web server environment and write the code in
JavaScript, Java and Python. To accomplish the implementation and cong-
uration, we used Java Development Kit and Spring MVC and Spring as the
3application framework to control the back-end of the web. It will read the input
le/knowledge base and stored into the web folder; call the bash le to start the
AutoPhrase processing and the generate other analysis results; read the text's
result and graphs; store those into the web folder; and produce the top 20 valu-
able phrases with corresponding size in the word cloud.
3. Term Frequency/Inverse Document Frequency(TF-IDF)
Analysis:
TF-IDF evaluates how relevant the word is in one document as an information
retrieval method. It works by increasing proportionally to the number of times
a word appears in a document, but is oset by the number of documents that
contain the word (MonkeyLearn 4). It is a numerical statistic that is intended
to reect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. For
example, the stop words such as \that"", \with"", \to"" will be ignored, because
those words are meaningless to represent the whole corpus as a whole. This
method is often used as a weighting factor in searches of information retrieval,
text mining, and user modeling.
The calculation is as follows:
Figure 2: TF-IDF Formula
We use the TdfVectorizer class from the sklearn.feature extraction.text li-
brary to perform TF-IDF analysis and combine it with the AutoPhrase to gen-
erate the word with corresponding quality value on the analysis. Sentiment
Analysis It is one of the uses of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to study
the subject information and aective states from text. Sentiment analysis (or
opinion mining) is a NLP technique used to determine whether data is positive,
negative or neutral. We use a Python library called text blob to analyze both a
polarity and subjectivity score on each sentence of the text corpus. Then plot
a distribution based on that. This would give users an insight on whether the
corpus is positive or negative overall and if it's more rational or emotional in
the text.
45 Results
On the rst web page, it shows a brief introduction of the methods and usages
of the web. The users can upload their own input text or knowledge base by
clicking on the upload buttons. After uploading, the text presentation will
automatically be updated as presentations. They can also upload their own
knowledge base by appending to the default le. Later, they can click the
button \Run AutoPhrase"" to start the analysis process. In this demo, we used
one data set called \DBLP.5k"", which is the rst 5000 lines on the \DBLP"" le
and it contains the topical key phrases from the scientic paper domain. We
use this data set, because it can generate results faster than the whole DBLP
data set, which is about 10 mins.
5Figure 3: Screenshot of the rst web page
On the second web page, it will present the progress of the running pro-
cess step by step. The whole process contains data cleaning, exploratory data
analysis, AutoPhrase analysis, and generating the graphs and images.
6Figure 4: Screenshot of the second web page
On the third web page, it presents the text and visualization results cor-
responding to their visualization, which all the results are shown in the below
section.
Text Analysis & Visualization Results from DBLP.5K:
AutoPhrase results include sets of sorted quality phrases but sometimes they
are not \high quality"" enough even with high quality scores. We use TF-IDF
Score* AutoPhrase quality score to measure the \quality"" of a phrase. The
TF-IDF and the AutoPhrase separate results will be presented as well. Also
the segmentation le highlights the key phrases produced by autophrase to
emphasize the phrase location in the text.
7Figure 5: Screenshot of the text presentations based on the data set DBLP.5K
We did some basic analysis about our text, which provide a brief description
of the sentences statistics, the token frequency, words number for each line, and
the top 20 frequent words in the tokenization steps. On the graphs, the users
can see the trend of tokens frequency from the most to the least, and can get
a sense of the rough number of tokens in the text. Moreover, it will show the
number of words in each line of the text, by a semi log plot.
8Figure 6: Basic Text Analyses for DBLP.5K.txt
The most important visualization for our web application is the word cloud.
The word cloud is plotted with E-chart library based on top 40 word-grams of
the AutoPhrase Score* TF-IDF score descending rank. After normalizing, we
multiply the value with the AutoPhrase result and select the top 40 high quality
phrases, which make the word cloud much more meaningful than only using the
AutoPhrase itself only. The phrases shown are much more informative than
the AutoPhrase generated phrases, because it not only contains the important
phrases, but also shows the frequent phrases from the text input.
9Figure 7: Word-cloud based on DBLP.5K.txt
In this quality score distribution, the users can detect the single-word and
multi-words phrases score as well. As we can see, the whole performance of
multi-words performs worse than a single word, because there are dierent com-
binations that can form from uni-gram and the single word is only itself without
any adds-on. There might be some special cases when there are some combina-
tions of high-quality phrases that are higher than a single word, which is much
more meaningful than the single phrase. It can be explained by the meaning of
a multi-word phrase that is much more meaningful than a single word and the
multi-word phrase fullls the concordance criteria than a single word, because
a single word does not have any context related word connecting with it.
10Figure 8: Quality score comparison between multi- and single-word phrases
We also perform sentiment analysis on the input corpus. Figures shown
below are the sentiment analysis result for DBLP.5K.txt. Since this is a sci-
entic journal, not surprisingly the polarity and subjectivity is zero for most
sentences, meaning most of them are quite neutral and objective. This meets
our expectations.
11Figure 9: Sentiment Analysis
126 Discussion
We conducted a basic data analysis of the results produced by AutoPhrase, how-
ever, even a small sample is quite accurate in producing high quality phrases
that are semantically sound and logical. Likewise, as seen through the phrase
similarity model, we achieved good similarity scores for phrases that are actu-
ally related. This directly shows that the AutoPhrase model can be used in
real-world applications { the model can be quite eective in domains such as
fraud detection, market research and public sentiment, all of which have a core
requirement of eective text mining techniques. Furthermore, I hope our web
can help the users to learn the Algorithms of AutoPhrase and get their results
much more meaningful and understandable.
7 Future Work
In the future, we plan to optimize the website to:
•reduce run- and load-time
•produce results for signicantly large les
•add more data analyses and visualizations
•let user know time taken by AutoPhrase for each model run on the text
corpus

Abstract
Movies are a rich source of human culture from which we can derive insight. Previous work addresses
either a textual analysis of movie plots or the use of phrase mining for natural language processing,
but not both. Here, we propose a novel analysis of movies by extracting key phrases from movie plot
summaries using AutoPhrase, a phrase mining framework. Using these phrases, we analyze movies
through 1) an exploratory data analysis that examines the progression of human culture over time,
2) the development and interpretation of a classiﬁcation model that predicts movie genre, and 3) the
development and interpretation of a clustering model that clusters movies. We see that this application of
phrase mining to movie plots provides a unique and valuable insight into human culture while remaining
accessible to a general audience, e.g., history and anthropology non-experts.
1 Introduction
Movies are a rich source of human culture from which
we can derive insight through a comprehensive tex-
tual analysis of movie plot summaries.
Here, weproposeananalysisofmoviesbyextract-
ing key phrases corresponding to discrete entities of
human culture. Such an analysis can help us bet-
ter understand popular topics, public attitudes, and
the overall progression and themes of human culture
throughout history.
This analysis is novel since we extract human cul-
ture from movies, an unconventional source, instead
of relying on traditional sources, e.g., historical texts;
we expect such a study to provide a unique perspec-
tive as a result. In addition, we expect such a study
to be especially useful for history and anthropology
non-experts, asweextractaccessiblekeyphrasesthat
serve as relevant keywords for further research by the
reader.
Previous work addresses either a textual analy-
sis of movie plots or the use of phrase mining for
natural language processing, but not both. Previous
analyses of movies are limited as they tend to simply
extractn-gramsusingrawtermfrequencies, whichof-
ten leads to incomplete or spurious phrases, instead
of using a dedicated and sophisticated phrase min-
ing framework that is capable of extracting complete
and coherent key phrases, such as the AutoPhrase
framework [6].
Here, we use AutoPhrase to explore a novel ap-
proach by applying phrase mining to the analysis of
movies.2 Data
Our dataset comes from the CMU Movie Summary
Corpus [2] and consists of movie plot summaries
extracted from Wikipedia and movie metadata ex-
tracted from Freebase.
The dataset contains around 42,000 movies from
1893 to 2014 as seen in Figure 1, a sizable dataset
for our study. Table 1 describes the variables of the
processed dataset.
Although movies can come from diﬀerent coun-
tries and may be in diﬀerent languages, all of the
movie plot summaries are in English (as the dataset
is extracted from English Wikipedia).
The variable of focus here is summary, from which
we extract key phrases to drive our analysis.
3 Methods
We ﬁrst extract key phrases from summary using Au-
toPhrase [6], a phrase mining framework that ex-
tracts high-quality phrases from a given text. We
use AutoPhrase for its ability to extract high-quality
phrases more eﬀectively than traditional, rudimen-
tary, phrase mining techniques, while maintaining
minimal human eﬀort during training.
We ﬁrst train AutoPhrase on all movie plot sum-
maries in the dataset, then extract the key phrases
from each individual summary and add these phrases
as a variable in our dataset as seen in Table 2. Figure
2 gives an example of phrases extracted from a movie
plot summary by AutoPhrase.

2Nearly all extracted phrases are indeed high-
quality and encapsulate ideas, events, objects, and
characters in the movie plot well.
Our analysis consists of three parts that build oﬀ
of these extracted phrases:
1. An exploratory data analysis (EDA) that ex-
amines the progression of human culture over
time.
2. The development and interpretation of a clas-
siﬁcation model that predicts movie genre.
3. The development and interpretation of a clus-
tering model that clusters movies.
We expect the combination of these three methods to
give us valuable insight into human culture.
3.1 EDA
We perform an EDA to discover how human culture
and events have progressed over time. Here, we use
statistical signals, i.e., tf-idf, to identify when certain
phrases (corresponding to discrete entities of human
culture and events) are popular and relevant.
We use tf-idf to measure a phrase’s relevance in
time where each phrase is a term and each period
of time (e.g. a year or decade) is a document. We
use sublinear term frequency (tf) scaling to reduce
the signiﬁcance of very common phrases (e.g. “ﬁlm”,
“life”) that are uninformative in our analysis.
Here, the tf-idf with sublinear tf scaling for a term
tof a document dis given by
tf-idf (t; d) = (1 + log tf(t; d))
log1 +n
1 + df (t)+ 1
where nis the total number of documents and df (t)
is the document frequency of t.
Given a TF-IDF vector for each period of time,
we then normalize each TF-IDF vector to have a Eu-
clidean norm of 1.
Finally, we deﬁne “top” phrases as the phrases
withthehighestTF-IDFvaluesforthecorresponding
period of time.
3.2 Classiﬁcation
Classifying movie genres using movie plot summaries
examines the power of phrase mining and explores its
application in information extraction in movie sector.
The results from the classiﬁcation can also disclose
some implicit features of movie genres through im-
portantphrases. Toobtainidealresults, weconstruct
a baseline model:1) Using TF-IDF vectorizer for words embedding
2) Construct multiple logistic regressions inside
OneVsRest Classiﬁer for each genre to predict the la-
bel.
3) Evaluating the model use f-1 score. We also
use some costumed indicator - percentage of correctly
predicted label and percentage of movie that has at
least one correctly predicted label
We further improve our model in following ways:
1) We try out diﬀerent algorithms in OneVsRest
Classiﬁer including LinearSVC and Multi-linear Per-
ceptron classiﬁer.
2) We perform GridSearch for hyper-parameters
tuning, changing diﬀerent loss function and diﬀerent
regularization penalty for best performance.
We also construct the text feature in two ways
1) Use all non-stopwords in plot summaries
2) Use only extracted phrases of these summaries
by Autophrase.
We can compare the results from these two ap-
proaches to explore the contribution of phrases to the
model.
Finally, to better evaluate our model, we will in-
terpret the coeﬃcients of words of classiﬁers to see
what words or phrases that our predictions mostly
relyon. Wethengenerateplotsforthewords/phrases
rank to evaluate the model using our understanding
ofgenreandseeiftheresultcantellusanythingmore
about the genre that we do not know before.
3.3 Clustering
We build a clustering pipeline on the movie plot sum-
maries to discover relationships between movies in a
marginally supervised perspective. As shown in Fig-
ure 3, our clustering pipeline contains three major
components: (1)buildandﬁne-tuneasentencetrans-
former to acquire document embeddings, (2) pick
representative sentences to condense plot summaries,
and (3) cluster document embeddings.
3.3.1 Model
We purpose to estimate the document embeddings
basedonapre-trainedsentencetransformer([5]). Ex-
periments in [1] show that the contextualized embed-
dings generated by pre-trained language models have
the capability to preserve domain information. Com-
pared with vanilla transformer networks, sentence
transformers are further tailored to estimate contex-
tualized sentence embeddings for semantic similarity
tasks ([5]). Therefore, the sentence transformer is the
strongest out-of-the-box model we can utilize.
3Figure 3: The clustering pipeline
Figure 4: Number of sentences per document (plot summary)
4Since the sentence transformer expects sentences
as input, we split each summary into sentences, ac-
quire an embedding for each sentence, and average
the embeddings to form document embeddings.
3.3.2 Condense plot summaries
As shown in Figure 4, the distribution of the number
of sentences in each movie summary is a long-tailed
distribution, where 46.05% of summaries have more
than 10 sentences. Since the transformer truncates
the document to a ﬁxed length, the embeddings ac-
quired from the model cannot fully capture the se-
mantics of long summaries. Therefore, it is necessary
to condense the movie summaries while preserving
most of the gist.
We purpose to rank the importance of the sen-
tences and choose sentences with top-k importance
to represent the entire summary. Here, we deﬁne the
importance as the average sublinear TF-IDF score,
where the dictionary of terms is only the quality
phrases. Under this notion of importance, sentences
withnoqualityphraseshaveanimportancescoreof0,
and sentences with more uncommon quality phrases
have a higher importance score. If the document has
fewer than ksentences, we keep all sentences. If
the document contains no quality phrases, we sam-
pleksentences randomly. To acquire the document
embeddings, we only use representative sentences in-
stead of all sentences.
3.3.3 Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning a pre-trained language model with a spe-
ciﬁc downstream task is a common practice to en-
hance the model performance. In our clustering
pipeline, we use semantic similarity as the down-
stream task, since we expect documents with similar
meanings to have closer embeddings, and vice versa.
For two pairs of sentences, we determine the simi-
larity by ﬁnding whether the genres associated with
these sentences have overlap. To generate the train-
ing dataset, we iteratively sample sentence pairs until
the training dataset contains at least npairs, where
halfofthepairshavepositivelabelsandtheotherhalf
have negative labels. In each iteration, the algorithm
samples two documents from the dataset, generates
the binary label based on their genres, and selects k
sentence pairs from two documents.
We use the Contrastive Loss ([3]) as the ﬁne-tune
target, since it aims to decrease the distance between
sentence embeddings of similar sentence pairs and in-
crease the distance between sentence embeddings of
dissimilar sentence pairs.3.3.4 Cluster embeddings
Following the practices in [1], we ﬁrst reduce the di-
mensions of embeddings to 50 with PCA, then clus-
ter the dimension-reduced embeddings using Gaus-
sian Mixture Model (GMM). [1] explained that the
mixture model is more suitable since we can view
each document embedding as from a mixture of dif-
ferent domain distributions, and applying PCA to
the embeddings accelerates the training process while
marginally damaging the performance.
4 Results
4.1 EDA
Figure 5 shows top phrases by decade, where top
phrases are deﬁned earlier as the phrases with the
highest tf-idf values for the corresponding decade.
To provide context, we annotate each phrase with
the name and year of the highest-grossing movie out
of all movies that contain that phrase in that decade.
In the case of a tie in gross revenue, we pick the movie
with the earlier release date.
We now examine the results by decade:
•1900s: It is important to note that the earliest
commercial movie screening occurred in 1895
and thus movies were still a relatively new phe-
nomenon in the early 1900s. Top phrases in
this decade do not appear to be very salient
but do reference objects that may be associated
with the early 20th century such as “horse” and
“train”.
•1910s: Many of the top phrases and their cor-
responding top movies in this decade relate to
Australia, which is reasonable since the Com-
monwealthofAustraliawasestablishedin1901.
This includes the phrases “bushranger” (an out-
lawlivingintheAustralianbush), “Melbourne”,
and “Australian” and the movies The Squatter’s
Daughter ,Moora Neya, or The Message of the
Spear,Mates from the Murrumbidgee ,Moonlite ,
andFor Australia .
•1920s: The most salient top phrases in this
decade, “Stan and Ollie” and “Laurel and
Hardy”, refer to the internationally famous
comedy duo Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy,
whose act was active from the 1920s to 1950s.
•1930s: We see the appearance of movie char-
acters Alfafa, Buckwheat, Spanky, and Stymie
from the Our Gang comedy series, Betty Boop
and Bimbo from the Talkartoon andBetty
5Figure 5: Top phrases by decade, with corresponding highest-grossing movie
6Boopcartoon series, actors Robert Armstrong
inKing Kong andEdwardArnoldin Mr. Smith
Goes to Washington , and the reappearance of
Stan and Ollie.
•1940s: Many of the top phrases and their cor-
responding top movies in this decade relate to
WorldWarII,foughtfrom1939to1945, includ-
ing the phrases “World War II” and “Nazi” and
the movies Foreign Correspondent ,The Best
Years of Our Lives ,The White Cliﬀs of Dover ,
andHitler’s Children . Weseetheappearanceof
movie characters Mammy Two Shoes from the
theTom and Jerry cartoon series, Daﬀy Duck
from the Looney Tunes andMerrie Melodies
cartoon series, actors Moe and Larry, the two
mainstay members of The Three Stooges, a fa-
mous comedy team active from the 1920s to
1970s (the third stooge changed multiple times
throughout the team’s history) and Harry Dav-
enport in Foreign Correspondent , and the reap-
pearance of Buckwheat.
•1950s: We continue to see phrases and movies
relating to World War II, including the movie
Giant. We see the appearance of movie charac-
ters The Bowery Boys and the reappearance of
Moe and Larry. We also see the phrase “Puddy
Tat” from Tweety’s catchphrase “I Taut I Taw
a Puddy-Tat” from the Sylvester and Tweety
cartoons and the phrase “mousehole” from the
Tom and Jerry cartoon series.
•1960s: We continue to see phrases and movies
relating to World War II. We see the use of
the phrase “beatnik”, a media stereotype preva-
lent fromthe1940s to1960sassociated withthe
nonconformist Beat Generation literary move-
ment in the post-war era, whose elements were
later incorporated into the hippie movement
and other counterculture movements. We see
the appearance of movie characters Speedy
Gonzales from the Looney Tunes andMerrie
Melodies cartoon series.
•1970s: Many of the top phrases and their cor-
responding top movies in this decade relate to
the Vietnam War, fought from 1955 to 1975,
including the phrases “Vietnam” and “Vietnam
War”. Other top phrases and their correspond-
ing top movies relate to martial arts, including
the phrases “kung fu” and “Shaolin”. During
this time, martial arts movies rose in popular-
ity, such as those featuring Bruce Lee, which
helped lead to an increase in Asian and Asian
American representation in cinema. We see theappearance of movie characters Tora-san from
theOtoko wa Tsurai yo Japaneseﬁlmseriesand
ﬁlm historian and critic Stuart Galbraith IV.
•1980s: We continue to see phrases and movies
relating to the Vietnam War. We see the
appearance of America’s CIA, founded in
1947, and the Soviet Union’s KGB, formed in
1954, two opposing security/intelligence agen-
cies whose appearance in movies may have been
popularized by the Cold War during this time
period. We see the appearance of Indian cin-
ema in the form of actors Mithun Chakraborty
inKismet, considered to be one of the founda-
tional ﬁlms of Bollywood, Lizy in Arante Mulla
Kochu Mulla , andRatiAgnihotriin Ullasa Par-
avaigal. We see the reappearance of Tora-San
and Stuart Galbraith IV.
•1990s: The top phrase in this decade is “HIV”,
which was ﬁrst clinically observed in 1981, trig-
gering much of the early HIV/AIDS research in
the 1980s. This development may have led to
HIV/AIDS being recognized by popular culture
inthefollowingyears; infact,thetopmoviecor-
responding to “HIV”, Philadelphia , was one of
the ﬁrst mainstream Hollywood movies to men-
tionHIV/AIDS.Wecontinuetoseephrasesand
movies relating to the CIA and Vietnam War.
We see technologies that may have been more
readily accessible to consumers in the late 20th
century, such as “video”, “tv”, “videotape”, and
“answering machine”. We see the appearance of
movie character Simran Singh in another Bolly-
wood movie, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge and
the reappearance of Mithun.
•2000s: The top phrase in this decade is “heart
attack”. It is unclear why, but as a continu-
ously leading cause of death since the mid-20th
century, cardiovascular disease may have been
especially prevalent in popular culture in this
time period. We see top phrases relating to
the September 11 attacks, namely “September
11” and “9/11”. We continue to see technolo-
gies that are relevant to consumers in this time
period, namely “laptop” and “internet”. We see
the appearance of “hip hop”, which became the
top-selling music genre by 1999 and continued
to become increasingly popular throughout the
2000s. We see the appearance of actors Sneha
inAutograph and John Abraham in Water.
•2010s: We come to the most recent decade in
the dataset. “Heart attack” continues to be the
top phrase in this decade. We continue to see
7technologies that are relevant to consumers in
this time period, namely “Facebook” and “in-
ternet”. Indian cinema continues its presence
with the appearance of actor N. Santhanam in
Thillalangadi and the reappearance of Sneha in
Theeradha Vilaiyattu Pillai .
We can see that examining and researching top
phrases over time gives us valuable insight into hu-
man culture and its public attitudes, events, people,
ideas, etc. Phrase mining and the use of tf-idf auto-
matically identiﬁes relevant keywords in a way that
would be diﬃcult to do manually or by using tradi-
tional text mining methods.
Figure 8 in Appendix goes into much ﬁner detail
by showing top phrases by year instead of decade and
is also available as an animation. There, we observe
a similar trend of top phrases across time but also
observe phrases that are peculiar to each year.
4.2 Classiﬁcation
Our baseline had a result F-1 score 0.332 using whole
summaries as feature and 0.29 using phrases. Our ﬁ-
nal model had a result F-1 score of 0.407 using sum-
maries and 0.364 using phrases.

We extract the coeﬃcients of words from the clas-

genre in our classiﬁcation. It helps to evaluate the
model as well as deliver some insights on genre pre-
diction. The plot shows the top 20 words that has
the largest coeﬃcients, thus the highest signiﬁcance
to the that genre. Due to lacking of ground truth to
compare with, we will put forward some interesting
ﬁndings from Figure 6 and Figure 7 :
•Drama: Using summary text, we found some
female names like Helene, Carmen, Johann in
the plots. Our model seems to place some im-
portance in the Female name when predicting
Drama movies. While using phrases, we found
more animals in the top phrases, like goa, cat-
tle, guinea pig, etc. There are more negative
words/phrases as well, like exorcism, ﬂatulence,
local-mob, domestic violence etc.•Comedy: Usingsummarytext, interestingly, we
found some male names in the top words, like
Elmo, Davey, Jones, Doug etc. Other words
mostly human behaviors or status like hurry,
ashamed, dig, chop, etc. Using phrase, we
ﬁnd the phrases and words are more region re-
lated, like Ethiopian, Baltimore, British Rag
etc. There are also lots of hostile words like
hostage, homophobia, ensuing battle, blockade,
destructive, etc. One hypothesis is that lots of
comedies use contradictions to provoke funny
scenes.
•Romance : Using summary text, we still see lots
of people names. There are also words describ-
ing relation status like deserted and attracted.
Using phrases, there appear to be some loca-
tions and community like Havana, Houston,
Rojo, death squad, and ﬁring squad. The re-
sults here seem quite deviated from what we
expected.
•Thriller: Using summary text, there are words
with uncanny meanings like alien, immortality,
bury, deadly. Using phrases, there are words
related to criminal scenes like drug cartel, cap-
tured and imprisoned.
4.3 Clustering
To examine our clustering pipeline, we cluster all vec-
torsinto200clustersandperformanalysisontheout-
put. We choose this number of clusters as the target
since each cluster will roughly contain 200 movies,
which is a reasonable size to derive ﬁne-grained se-
mantic units.
Since the original dataset contains more than 300
genres and each document contains multiple genres,
assigning the cluster label with the most common la-
bel within the cluster ([1]) is not feasible. Instead, we
choosetodeterminethesemanticsoftheclusterusing
multiple heuristics, including quality phrase distribu-
tions and the overlaps with existing genres.
Quality phrases. To preserve the generality, we
remove all phrases that occur in less than 100 doc-
uments. Then, for each phrase in each cluster, we
calculate the document frequency within the clus-
ter relative to its document frequency in the entire
dataset. In other words, when a phrase occurs more
frequently in this cluster than other clusters, we con-
sider this phrase as a representative of this cluster.
We rank the relative document frequencies of quality
phrases in each cluster and pick the top 5 phrases to
represent the cluster.
8Figure 6: ﬁnal model result with summary text features
Figure 7: ﬁnal model result with phrase features
Table 3 in the Appendix shows some examples of
the representative quality phrases. From the exam-
ples, we can observe that many clusters can capture
meanings that can be easily identiﬁed. We can infer
that example 1 contains movies about special forces,
example 2 is about martial arts in Asia, and example
3 is about sports. However, we cannot identify the
speciﬁc topic for some clusters like examples 4 and 5.
Genres. We repeat the same process as examin-
ing the quality phrase memberships to examine the
overlaps with genres. Table 4 in the Appendix shows
some examples of the genre distributions. We can ob-
serve that many clusters (like example 1, 2, 3) gather
the movies with similar genres together with only a
few hints about similarity during the ﬁne-tuning pro-
cess. However, for clusters like examples 4 and 5, we
cannot identify an obvious topic.
We can see that the document embeddings can
capture the semantics of the summaries to some ex-
tent, and feeding them to a clustering pipeline give
us insights about the relationships between movies.
By deﬁning heuristics and summarize from each clus-
ter, we can observe more connections that are hidden
from the existing human crafted features.
5 Discussion
In this paper, we apply phrase mining to movie plots,
a novel approach for the textual analysis of movies,for a unique insight into human culture.
In the EDA investigation, we use statistical sig-
nals to select the most relevant phrases describing
each time period. In the classiﬁcation investigation,
we explore diﬀerent classiﬁcation method for best
genre prediction performance. In the clustering in-
vestigation, weutilizequalityphrasesandpre-trained
language models to discover the relationship between
movies in a nearly unsupervised approach.
In each of these investigations, we demonstrate
phrase mining’s eﬀectiveness in producing valuable
insight into human culture.
For future work, we may consider omitting movie
character and/or actor names from the top phrases,
asmoviecharactersandactors, unlesshistoricallysig-
niﬁcant, are not central to our analysis of human cul-
ture.

1 Introduction
Stock market is one of the most popular markets that the investors like to
put their money in. There are millions of investors who participate in the stock
market investment directly or indirectly, such as by mutual fund, dened-benet
plan. Certainly, there are many people who research on the stock market, and
they all know the information takes an important role in the decision making.
According to the Strong Form Market Eciency Theorem, the stock price is
only determined by the new information; otherwise, it will be a random walk.
For example, if a new annual report claims the 50 percent increase in earning
per share, the investors will expect the stock price to increase by 50 percent
correspondingly. However, there are thousands of information in this market
everyday, and the investors can only pay attention to few of them. Therefore,
the investors, especially the individual investors without the help of professional
nancial analyst, can only get the parts of the whole information, so his invest-
ment decisions may be biased. In this project, we want to solve this real-world
problem to apply the Phrase mining technique to forecast the stock price and
help the investors to make the decision. By the inspiration of the AutoPhrase
NLP model from Professor Shang[1], we are going to apply the AutoPhrase
model to extract the high-quality phrases from the 8-K report, which described
the big event happened in the company, and use machine learning to predict
the stock price. We will also give some case studies to apply our model in the
real nancial investment. We hope our project can help the investors to make
good decisions and get extra prot of the portfolio.
2 Literature Review
The researches of stock price prediction were a hot topic hundreds years ago, as
long as the stock data were available to the investors. The investors were trying
to nd a solid method to predict the future price from the past trading data, such
as price and volume, which was called the technical analysis. For example, in
1930s, the professional accountant Ralph Nelson Elliott discovered some special
1price pattern, and he introduced the Elliott Wave Theorem to explain each of the
patterns. Moreover, some investors also want to predict the stock performance
based on the past operating data, such as prot margin, Earning per share. This
is called the fundamental analysis. However, Our project about 8-K reports is
a dierent analysis, called event-driven analysis. The event-driven analysis is a
particular type of analysis based on the new information, especially the major
events happened to the companies. These events, no matter good or bad, are
the motivation of the price trend, because they can signicantly change the
expectation of the investors. The event-driven analysis is dierent from the
previous technical analysis, because it is not based on the past information. It
researches on the latest information and give the investment recommendation.
Our project is a kind of event-driven analysis, which is to apply AutoPhrase
model to extract the key information from the nancial news and make the
decision. There are many former event-driven analysis models. Heeyoung Lee
and other three scholars apply unigram model to the Form 8-K to get the feature
vector and train a linear model to predict the stock price.[6] However, in our
project, we do the phrase mining with AutoPhrase model on the 8-K reports
database and extract the high-quality phrases. We then get our feature vectors
based on the apparent of the high-quality phrases on these 8-K reports, instead
of unigram model. We want to do an empirical testing on the AutoPhrase
to analyze whether the AutoPhrase model can help to extract a better phrase
vector for stock price prediction.
3 Methodology
3.1 Overview
In this project, we will train a machine learning model based on the phrase
vectors from the AutoPhrase model and compare with two baseline models. We
are doing a classication task, instead of a regression task on the stock price. We
label the price data as three price trend classes { ""Up"", ""Stay"" and ""Down"",
based on the certain intervals of price change percentage. The rst baseline
model is the EPS model, which only uses the ""Surpriseness"" of the Earning
per share to predict the price trend. The denition of ""Surpriseness"" will be
described in the following section. The second baseline model is the linear model
based on unigram given by Heeyoung Lee. He got around 50% accuracy on the
testset, based only on unigram feature vectors. For this project, we will train
our own models based on the AutoPhrase high-quality phrases and compare
with the baseline models. We will also tune the hyper-parameters and compare
dierent machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Logistic regression,
SVM.
23.2 Data Source
We collect the data from two dierent data sources. The rst one is the IFind
Financial Data Terminal. We have collected about 2000 8-K report and corre-
sponding price data from the terminal. In addition, we also have a 8-K DataBase
(Size: 1.4G Click to Download)[6] from Stanford by Heeyoung Lee, Mihai Sur-
deanu, Bill MacCartney, and Dan Jurafsky.
3.3 Price trend labels
For the stock price, we have the daily stock price for the 10 years. We calculate
the overnight, 7-day, 14-day and 30-day price change, which is percentage change
of a certain future day to the original day that the 8-K reports released. We also
eliminate the eects of the systematic stock market change by subtracting the
SP 500 stock index percentage change. If the price change percentage is higher
than 1%, we label it as ""Up"". If the price change is between -1% and 1%, we
label it as ""Stay"". If the price change is below -1%, we label it as ""Down"".
3.4 ""Surpriseness"" of EPS
We have the data for two kinds of EPS, the reported EPS and the concensus
EPS, which is the estimated EPS provided by the stock researchers. The per-
centage dierence between these two types of EPS is called the Surprise. If the
reported EPS is higher than the concensus EPS, there is a positive Surprise,
and we expect that the stock price will go up. If the reported EPS is lower than
the concensus EPS, we expect the stock price will go down.
3.5 AutoPhrase
First, we apply the AutoPhrase model to our 8-K reports with the knowledge
base quality terms from the Wikipedia provided by Professor Shang. We do
some data analysis and visualization, but the outcome is not what we expect.
There are many high-quality terms provided by AutoPhrase model, that are
meaningless to a nancial report. Based on the advice from Professor Shang,
we nd our own nancial knowledge base. We do the web mining to the In-
vestopedia website, which is a website to help people to study nance. We get
about 7000 Financial Terms from the Investopedia and replace the wiki terms
to the nancial terms.
3.6 Models
We selected 3 dierent classiers, each trained on our 3 dierent feature sets:
baseline, baseline + unigram features, baseline + phrase features. Out of the
Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest classiers, the Random Forest
had the best results on the training, validation, and test set.
33.6.1 Baseline
Includes only nancial features (earnings surprise, price movements from 7 to
365 days, volatility index) and event features. After tuning hyperparameters
on the validation set, the best model was the Random Forest classier with
parameters, max depth = 10 and n estimators = 2000. This model gave a
51.94% on the test set.
3.6.2 Unigram + Phrase
To see if text features could add any additional value to our model, we utilized
the baseline features along with either phrase or unigram features. Each model
utilized 2107 text features, encoded as a vector with binary entries. After tuning
hyperparameters, the nal model included parameters, max depth = 10, n esti-
mators = 2000, and max features = 1250, for both the unigram and the phrase
model. These models generated accuracies of 52.56% and 52.61% respectively.

Table 1: Base descriptive info of 8-K reports
The Table 1 shows the number of 8-K's, number of words, and number of
companies per split (training, validation, and test). Despite the large number of
words and 8-K's in our training set, the balance of rms (1444 total) through-
out all of our splits can help our model have more balanced predictions across
various rms.
Table 2 lists some of the most common event types (reason for ling an
8-K) within the training set. Since dierent events can drastically change the
contents of an 8-K form, we thought it as a signicant feature in identifying
variance among groups.
Table 3 shows that our data consists of around 38% \down"", 22% \stay"",
and 40% \up"" labels. This breakdown is also roughly consistent within each
split: train, validation, and test. This will allow for our training data to match
the rest of the splits as best as possible. Though the \stay"" labels only make
up a small minority of the data, it is more important to better predict \down""
and \up"" due to its larger price swings.

Table 4: Top 10 phrase Frequency
The Table 4 shows the distribution of the top 10 unigrams and phrases
within our 8-K forms. The top phrases are seen in a smaller percentage of 8-K's
compared to our unigrams which are all almost 90% and above in frequency. The
high frequencies among unigrams may make it a less valuable feature because
of the homogeneous depiction of 8-K's. The phrases on the other hand may be
able to better reveal dierences within dierent 8-K forms.
54.2 Tokenization and Documents Analysis
We tokenize our documents and label the documents based on the price change
compared to the benchmark stock index. We analyze about the class distribu-
tion and sentence information. From the Figure 1, Classes are pretty balanced
balanced: 60.4% outperformed the index and 39.6% underperformed compared
to the index. From the Figure 2, Distribution of token frequencies and document
length is essentially the same among both classes.

64.3 Sentiment Analysis
We also conducted some sentiment analysis on the sentences in the 8-K reports.
From Figure 3, we found out that the distribution of median subjectivity is

the knowledge base (pulled from Investopedia) we were able to output phrases
that have semantic value within an 8-K form and the nancial world.

Table 8: Class Accuracy
5 Result Analysis
5.1 Model Performance
Table 8 show's each model's accuracy broken down by labels. All of the models
were able to predict \up"" and \down"" better than chance which has the poten-
tial to provide great benets in the nancial world. Though all three models
perform relatively the same for the \up"" and \down"" label, the unigram and the
phrase models are able to predict the \stay"" label with much higher accuracy.
For our test set, the phrase model had the highest accuracy among all the 3
labels but only by a very small margin.
Through using micro-averages and the OneVsRestClassier, Figure 7 shows
the estimated ROC curve for all three models. All three models are able to
perform relatively the same in terms of sensitivity and specicity.
As shown by Figure 5 and 6, the model's most important features were
dominated by the main numerical features: price changes and earnings surprise
(the most dominant feature). The high predicting power of these features helps
to explain the baseline's similar performance to the other enhanced models.
Nevertheless, it is interesting to note some of the phrases and unigrams that
contributed to the model's predictability such as \weak"" or \revenue growth"".
Since many of these words/phrases make sense in a nancial context, it helps to
explain how some were able to have a small impact on the model, while words
or phrases such as \gentleman"" or \fee letters"" have no impact on the model.
5.2 Simulation
We do a simulation to invest the stock market with our AutoPhrase model.
We rst train the models using data from 2002-2009. In each month of 2010-
2012, we buy the stock with ""UP"" prediction result and short the stock with
""DOWN"" prediction, and calculate the average rate of return, assuming there
is no commission fee. Note that this is the best way to simulation because the
date and event of the 8-K reports are unpredictable. It is hard to buy all the
stocks predicted to ""UP"", because we don't know the exact number of these
stocks, and we are hard to assign the money to each of the stocks. In addition,
the money needed for ""short"" is not same as ""buy"". Therefore, our simulation
is not the best simulation based on the reality.
9Figure 7 is the rate of return curve. (All the rate of reutrn is normalized
by SP 500 Index.) In this chart, the three models perform very similar. The
rate of return for AutoPhrase model is highest, which is 201.8%, and the EPS
Baseline is the lowest, which is 197.1%. The return for Unigram model is in the
middle, which is 201.2%.
6 Conclusion
From the paper, we can see that the linguistics factors, such as Unigram and
Phrase mining, can help the prediction of the future price trend. However, the
model with AutoPhrase does not outperforms the model with single unigram.
Nonetheless, it is still a very interesting topic to apply the phrase mining to
company news and help to make investment decision. We are looking for further
research on the application of the AutoPhrase model.

Abstract
Text Classiﬁcation (TC) and Named-
Entity Recognition (NER) are two funda-
mental tasks for many Natural Language
Processing (NLP) applications, which in-
volve understanding, extracting information,
and categorizing the text. In order to achieve
these goals, we utilized AutoPhrase [2] and
a pre-trained language NER model[3] to ex-
tract quality phrases. Using these as part of
our features, we are able to achieve very high
performance for a ﬁve-class and a twenty-
class text classiﬁcation dataset. Our project1
will follow a similar setting as previous
works with train, validation, and test datasets
and comparing the results across different
methods.

1 Introduction
Text classiﬁcation is an important NLP task, which
can be understood as a given set of texts and labels.
We want to create a classiﬁer that can classify these
given inputs in addition to other texts. Text classiﬁ-
cation tasks mainly involve understanding the text and
extracting high quality phrases for model training. For
example, if a text has ""government"" or ""minister"" as
a frequent phrase or word, it is more likely to be-
long to ’Politics’. As such, it is important for us to
extract quality phrases and make sure they represent
these documents well.
Named-Entity Recognition and Phrase-Mining are
some methods to extract quality phrases. For NER, the
1Github: tinyurl.com/55mnsfeatask mainly involves locating and classifying the word
in the text to entities that are predeﬁned categories and
domains, e.g. ""“Bill Gates” – Person; “Sandag” – Or-
ganization. A well-trained NER model is optimal to
extract entities. One of our hypotheses is that these en-
tities are representative of the text. To further improve
our classiﬁer, we would like to incorporate a phrase-
mining task in our project. AutoPhrase[2] is a method
that can extract quality phrases from a corpus with a
ranking, without the need for any human annotations.
As we have learned from experimenting from last quar-
ter, it is very efﬁcient and powerful compared to many
existing methods. By extracting such quality phrases,
we believe we could build a stronger classiﬁer for text
classiﬁcation.
We are motivated by our interest in exploring lan-
guage related NER models. We believe this project is
an excellent opportunity for both exploring language
models, Named-Entity Recognition tasks, and Text
Classiﬁcation tasks. By utilizing the Phrase-Mining
and NER tools, we are able to achieve very high per-
formance on both BBC and 20 News Groups dataset.
In parallel, we conduct an analysis and compare the
performance between each of the methods.
2 EDA
We began this project by investigating NER prob-
lems and found many existing methods have been
trained on the CoNNL2003 dataset. This dataset con-
tains 20,744 English sentences and four major types
of entities: PER (person), LOC (location), ORG (or-
ganizations), and MISC (entities not included in the
previous three).
After experimenting with training a Named-Entity
Recognition model, we found that it was a difﬁcult
and time-consuming task. Considering the quarter-
long time constraint and our current skill set, we de-
cided to direct our focus to Text Classiﬁcation.For text classiﬁcation, we have used two datasets: a
BBC News dataset2and a 20 News Groups dataset3,
which are commonly used for text classiﬁcation tasks.
BBC News dataset: includes 2,225 documents
and spans 2004-2005; composed of ﬁve cate-
gories (entertainment, technology, politics, busi-
ness, and sports.
FEATURE DESCRIPTION
’text’ a BBC article corpus
’target’ the Text Classiﬁcation
’summary’ summary of corpus
Table 1: Features of the BBC News Dataset
20 News Groups dataset: includes 18,000 news
groups posts; composed of 20 categories (Com-
puter, Science, Politics, Religion, etc.)
FEATURE DESCRIPTION
’post’ a post-formatted corpus
’target’ the Text Classiﬁcation
’target names’ name of the document target
Table 2: Features of the 20 News Groups Dataset
As we can see from Figure 1, for each category,
there are about 400 - 500 news reports; the dataset is
fairly balanced between the categories.
Figure 1: Documents Counts for Each Category from
BBC news
Based on the results from Figure 2, the range of the
summary text is about 10 - 250 tokens, meaning it can
be considered normally distributed. For the shorter

com/pariza/bbc-news-summary
320 News Groups Dataset:
http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/length entries, they may face more issues when per-
forming the Text Classiﬁcation. We will compare the
results between the different lengths.

BBC News
Regarding Figure 3, the word clouds indicate that
there are some words that appear more frequently than
others in each category; this may play a signiﬁcant role
in how the documents are classiﬁed.

BBC News
3 Feature Engineering
For all feature engineering, we are using the tra-
ditional Bag-of-Words and Term Frequency–Inverse
Document Frequency (TF-IDF) representations to en-
code the entities and quality phrases into vectors. The
major difference is the vocabulary pool we are using
for the different feature engineering.
3.1 Entity-based Feature
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers) is a general-purpose language model
trained on the large dataset. This pre-trained model
can be ﬁne-tuned and used for different tasks such as
sentiment analysis, question answering systems, sen-
tence classiﬁcation, and Named-Entity Recognition.
Named-Entity Recognition is the process of extract-
ing noun entity from text data and classifying theminto predeﬁned categories e.g. person, location, or-
ganization and others. Hence, we can use a BERT-
based Named-Entity Recognition model, ﬁne-tuned on
the CoNLL 2003 dataset, to extract noun entities in the
BBC News data set and 20 News group datasets.
For our experiment, we have used the BERT-based
uncased model as a baseline trained by the Hug-
gingFace library with 110M parameters, 12 layers,
768-hidden, and 12-heads. For ﬁne-tuning, we used
the suggested parameters of max seq length =128,
training epoch =3, and warmup proportion =0:1.
Then, we created the dataframe for BBC News sum-
mary data and used the model to predict the entity by
each sentence of the document. We followed the same
procedure for the 20 News Dataset.
Figure 4: Entity Cloud (20 News Groups)
3.2 AutoPhrase-based Feature
AutoPhrase[2] is a method that builds upon Seg-
Phrase [1], that is a completely automated technique
that can extract quality phrases from massive text. Un-
like SegPhrase, which requires human labeling, Au-
toPhrase utilizes Wikipedia, or similar existing knowl-
edge bases, and raw corpora as input.
AutoPhrase has two major modules: Robust
Positive-Only Distant Training and POS-Guided
Phrasal Segmentation. The ﬁrst module trains the
model and determines the quality score for phrases;
the second module determines which tokens should be
combined together and constitute a phrase. AutoPhrase
ﬁrst estimates the quality score from frequent n-gram
phrases. With these results, it then utilizes the segmen-
tation module to revise the segmentation. Rather than
using the n-gram based phrases, AutoPhrase estimates
the ﬁnal quality score again based on the segmentation
results.
Since AutoPhrase is applicable to any domains and
languages, we are able to utilize this method on both
of our datasets to extract quality phrases. From Table
3 below, these are high quality phrases extracted from
the 20 News Groups dataset, with many phrases espe-
cially for the sports and politics groups. We believe
these are useful features to include in our experiment.p-value Phrases

4 Model & Experiment
4.1 Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a binary classiﬁer that is
widely adopted for many research projects and real-
world applications. As such, we decided to incorporate
this model in our experiment as well. This model is op-
timized by minimizing the Logistic Loss (Equation 1).
L(yi;byi) = (yilog(byi) + (1 yi)log(1 byi)) (1)
Since Logistic Regression is a binary classiﬁer, we
have used a One-Verses-Rest strategy in this multi-
class classiﬁcation task. This means training a binary
classiﬁer for each class (e.g. Does this text belong to
the Sports group?)
4.2 Support Vector Machine
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised
model intended for solving classiﬁcation problems.
The SVM algorithm creates a line or a hyper-plane,
which separates the data into classes. This model is
optimized by minimizing the Hinge Loss (Equation 2)

i=1max(0;1 yi(wTxi b) (2)
4.3 BERT
The architecture of BERT’s transfer learning is made
up by a fully-connected layer, a drop-out layer, a Rec-
tiﬁed Linear Unit (ReLU) activation layer, a second
fully-connected layer, and a soft-max activation layer.
For the optimizer, we used AdamW, an improved ver-
sion of Adam, and opted to use the negative log-
likelihood loss, which is well-suited for multiple-class
classiﬁcation. For training, we used a learning rateof 1e 4for 40 epochs. Due to GPU resources, we
were only able to perform training and evaluation on
the BBC News dataset.[4]
4.4 Experiment
For both datasets, we have adopted a
train/validation/test split. For the 20 News group
dataset, we used the sklearn library and then applied
a 50% / 50% on the test section. For the BBC news
dataset, we adopted the 60% / 20% / 20% split.
We tested the combinations of two major models
(LOG and SVM) over three vocabulary lists. We used
Bag-of-Word models as our main baseline, as we can
see from the results below. Our model combining Uni-
grams, Entities, and AutoPhrase features performs the
best across all models.
5 Results
For the models constructed, the vectors are gener-
ated using Bag-of-Words or Tf-Idf and vary by their
vocabulary lists.
There are four main vocabulary lists:
Uni-gram V ocabulary List (UNI)
Entity V ocabulary List (ET)
AutoPhrase V ocabulary List (AP)
All Vectors V ocabulary List (ALL)

6 Conclusion
The BERT classiﬁcation on the ﬁve-class BBC
News dataset does not outperform any of our im-
plemented models. From our results table, we ob-
served that our models have F1-Score and Accu-
racy performances at around 0.95, indicating they are
high-performing classiﬁers. The best of them is the
SVM+ALL(TF-IDF) classiﬁer, or the Support Vector
Machine with the All Vector V ocabulary List and Tf-
Idf Representations, which uses the vocabulary from
both NER results and AutoPhrase results. Because the
quality phrases between different domains are likely to
differ, we expect these results to be optimal features
for our predictors.For the 20 News Group dataset, the SVM+ALL(TF-
IDF) classifer also outperformed the other models,
with the F1-Score and Accuracy being 0.84. Consid-
ering the classes are huge (i.e. 20 classes), these re-
sults verify our model is high-performing. Applying
our best model on the ﬁve-class BBC News dataset, we
attained a F1-Score at 0.9525, and Accuracy at 0.9528;
while for the 20 News Group, we yielded a F1-Score
at 0.8463 and Accuracy at 0.8478.
In this project, we utilized AutoPhrase and pre-
trained BERT NER model for text classiﬁcation. The
results are pretty powerful in terms of accuracy and F1
score. We do think Entity and Quality Phrases are very
powerful features to use for text classiﬁcation task.
However, if we include the uni-gram feature as well
we would achieve much better performance.

Abstract

​
When
encountering
scientific
papers,
it
is
challenging
for
readers
themselves
to
find
other
related
works.
First
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
all,
it
is
hard
to
identify
keywords
that
summarize
the
papers
to
search
for
similar

This
dilemma
is
most
common
if
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
readers
are
not
familiar
with
the
domains
of

are
reading.
Meanwhile,
traditional

Some
existing

also
fail
to
catch

to
return
high-quality

1. INTRODUCTION
 
An
existing
dilemma
when
reading
scientific
papers
is
that
it’s
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
difficult
to
identify
the
keywords
that
can
summarize
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
paper.
As
a
result,
when
one
wants
to
read
more
about
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
certain
topic
by
inputting
possible
keywords
to
search
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
similar
papers
on
a
search
engine
or
digital
library,
he
or
she
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
might
not
be
able
to
find
the
papers
they
want.
If
the
input
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
keywords
were
too
broad,
they
might
find
many
unrelated
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
papers
in
the
search
output.
On
the
other
hand,
if
the
keywords
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were
too
specific,
the
output
paper
might
contain
the
original
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
paper
and
papers
that
have
mentioned
the
same
specific
term
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
but
the
broad
domain
or
topics
are
different.
This
dilemma
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
happens
most
often
when
one
is
not
familiar
with
the
domain
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or
topic
of
the
paper
that
he
or
she
is
reading.
Nevertheless,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
computer
science
could
assist
people
in
extracting
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
representative keywords from text via text analysis techniques.
 
Text
analysis,
also
known
as
text
data
mining,
aims
at
deriving
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
information
from
the
text
(e.g.,
papers
and
magazines)
by
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
structuring
raw
data
into
structured
data
and
interpreting
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
result.
Phrase
mining
is
a
fundamental
task
of
text
analysis
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that
extracts
high-quality
phrases
from
a
text
corpus.
Instead
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
of
traditional
n-grams
segmentation,
phrase
mining
focuses
on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
high-quality
phrases
that
represent
the
input
text
expressly
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
thus
improves
the
computational
models
of
applications
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
require
to
find
phrases
with
great
interest
and
relevance
in
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
specific
domain,
such
as
taxonomy
construction
and
topic
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
modeling
[9]
[10]
[11].
Without
an
efficient
phrase
mining
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
method,
while
nearly
all
the
current
digital
libraries
have
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommendations
for
each
document,
they
fail
to
catch
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
specific
topics
of
the
paper
to
recommend
similar
works.
They
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
usually
use
a
traditional
recommendation
model
which
is
built
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on
user
profile
and
collection
data.
The
model
is
good
at
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
suggesting
the
papers
that
users
would
like
to
read
but
not
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
related works, which is what many researchers want [8].
 
 
To
address
the
difficulty
of
manually
extracting
keywords
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from
papers
and
poor
recommender
system
for
related
work
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
other
websites,
we
built
a
website
called
AutoLibrary
where
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
users
could
use
it
as
their
personal
digital
library
to
save
their
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
documents
and
could
find
similar
papers
for
each
input
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
scientific
paper.
To
achieve
this
goal,
we
decided
to
introduce
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AutoPhrase
into
this
paper
searching
process
[1].
While
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
user
inputs
a
paper
and
specifies
a
domain,
we
first
use
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AutoPhrase
to
extract
quality
phrases
from
the
input
paper.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AutoPhrase
is
a
phrase
mining
method
created
by
Jingbo
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Shang.
It
minimizes
the
required
human
effort
of
other
phrase
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mining
methods
and
improves
the
result
by
using
two
new
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
techniques.
The
first
technique
is
Robust
Positive-Only
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distant
Training
and
the
second
one
is
POS-Guided
Phrasal
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Segmentation.
Since
it
is
hard
to
ensure
the
significance
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
quality
phrases
generated
from
a
single
paper
to
both
the
paper
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
its
domain,
we
build
a
dataset
that
contains
the
quality
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
phrases
of
different
domains
by
running
AutoPhrases
on
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
corpora
of
each
domain.
After
applying
weight
to
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AutoPhrase
results
of
a
single
document
with
our
pre-obtained
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
domain-specific
phrases,
we
can
rank
the
phrases
again
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
filter
out
domain’s
unimportant
phrases.
Then
by
searching
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
keywords
with
the
highest
quality
scores
on
Semantic
Scholar,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AutoLibrary
scraps
and
displays
the
search
result
on
its
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
website.
AutoLibrary
also
allows
users
to
customize
their
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
search,
such
as
manually
adding
keywords
and
changing
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
selection
of
keywords.
It
might
also
store
users’
searching
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
history
in
their
local
machine
so
that
they
could
quickly
look
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
back to papers that they read as well as their search results.
 
To
summarize,
the
main
benefit
of
AutoLibrary
is
that
it
eases
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
pain
point
of
extracting
keywords
from
papers
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
unfamiliar
domains
or
topics
and
provides
a
customized
user
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
experience
for
scholarly
paper
searching.
The
usage
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AutoPhrase
for
the
text
analyzer
on
scientific
papers
make
our
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommender
systems
outperform
other
recommender
systems
 
 
 
 
 
 
both
in
accuracy
and
in
user-friendly.
Our
experiments
on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
papers
of
different
domains
and
result
analysis
support
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conclusion.
 
2. RELATED WORK
 
As
the
knowledge
base
of
human
beings
expands
and
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
number
of
fields
of
study
increases,
there
has
been
a
growing
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
need
for
more
comprehensive
and
better
organized
digital
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
libraries
for
academic
papers.
The
unprecedented
development
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
the
Internet
and
computers
made
the
realization
of
digital
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
libraries
possible
and
accessible
by
scholars
and
researchers
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
all over the world.
 
In
1945,
researcher
Vannevar
Bush
proposed
a
conceptual
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
digital
device,
called
Memex[1],
which
could
store
huge
bulks
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
books
and
documents
and
enable
fast
access
to
them.
The
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
device
was
inspired
by
the
dilemma
at
that
time
when
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
researchers
were
struggling
to
index
printed
documents.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Though
the
device
was
not
physically
implemented,
it
was
an
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
influential concept for later hypertext systems development.
 
In
1956,
Licklider,
a
pioneer
of
the
Internet,
started
looking
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for
ways
to
apply
computer
technology
to
improve
libraries.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Similar
to
Bush,
he
proposed
to
use
the
Internet
to
make
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
library
materials
accessible
to
a
wider
range
of
people[2].
In
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
system
that
he
called
a
procognitive
system,
Licklider
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
listed
the
three
components
of
it:
a
knowledge
base,
questions
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
answers.
These
components
were
the
basis
of
modern
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
digital libraries.
 
Though
ideas
and
efforts
had
been
aggregated
in
this
domain,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
first
mature
digital
library
was
not
invented
until
1966.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Education
Resources
Information
Center
(ERIC),
sponsored
 
 
 
 
 
 
by
the
Institute
of
Education
Sciences
of
the
United
States
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Department
of
Education,
contains
the
full
text
of
a
variety
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
publications,
such
as
research
papers,
books
and
journals.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Being
an
online
collection,
ERIC
provides
service
to
a
large
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
number
of
users
and
also
accepts
materials
from
them
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enrich
its
database.
Notably,
it
has
a
controlled
vocabulary,
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thesaurus
of
ERIC
Descriptors,
which
facilitates
users
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
search for subjects that they are seeking.
 
 
As
experiences
and
knowledge
accumulate,
the
need
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
integrating
and
improving
previous
functionality
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
methodologies
of
digital
libraries
grew.
In
2006,
members
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
DELOS
Network
of
Excellence
on
Digital
Libraries
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
published
the
​
Digital
Library
Manifesto
​
[3],
which
includes
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
core
idea
of
a
digital
library
framework.
The
framework
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
includes
three
types
of
systems:
Digital
Library,
Digital
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Library
System,
and
the
Digital
Library
Management
System.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This
framework
brought
intelligent
discussions
of
the
Digital
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Library Universe.
 
 
Nowadays,
there
are
some
very
good
digital
library
products
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in
the
world.
Amongst
them,
one
of
the
most
widely
used
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Google
Scholar,
which
is
considered
as
hosting
the
largest
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
scholar
paper
database
in
the
world[4].
What
really
put
it
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
spotlight
is
its
ranking
algorithm.
Google
Scholar
claims
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that
its
ranking
algorithm
is
automatically
based
on
multiple
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
factors,
instead
of
allowing
users
to
select
just
one
factor
as
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
most
other
libraries
do.
However,
Jöran
Bee
and
Bela
Gipp
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
studied
its
ranking
algorithm
and
claimed
that
it
gave
an
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
outstanding
weight
to
the
number
of
citations[5].
As
a
result,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
older
papers
with
more
citations
are
likely
to
be
cited
again
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
again,
while
leaving
new
academic
papers
out
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
searching results.
 
Like
the
recommender
systems
in
other
digital
products,
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommendation
models
of
current
digital
libraries
use
Library
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
collection
data,
user
profile,
web
server
log
file,
etc.
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommend
similar
work,
such
as
calculating
user-to-user
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
similarity
and
item-to-item
similarity[8].
However,
one
major
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
issue
is
that
other
recommender
systems
aim
at
providing
user
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
products
they
like,
while
the
recommender
system
of
digital
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
libraries
should
provide
related
works
for
researchers
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
further
study
the
specific
domain.
Such
a
recommendation
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
model
also
does
not
employ
the
text
information
within
each
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
document.
 
Based
on
previous
works
on
digital
libraries,
we
position
our
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
website
as
a
digital
library
system,
since
it
allows
users
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
interact
with
the
Semantic
Scholar
collection,
but
doesn't
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
preserve
a
database
for
scholar
papers.
In
addition,
we
will
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mainly
focus
on
improving
the
system
by
using
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
state-of-the-art
techniques
to
extract
quality
phrases
from
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
input papers and accurately recommend papers that they need.
 
 
3. DATASETS
 
The
dataset
we
used
to
train
our
model
is
the
arXiv
dataset
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
available
on
Kaggle.
The
dataset
contains
information
about
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
more than 1.7 million scholarly articles across STEM.
 
 
The
way
we
incorporate
AutoPhrase
and
the
dataset
is
to
use
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
latter
as
a
positive-phrase
pool
for
the
former
to
train
on.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In
order
to
get
the
positive
pool,
we
extracted
titles
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
abstracts
from
each
paper
to
form
our
customized
dataset
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
train our model.
 
 
The
generated
model
will
be
saved
and
to
make
predictions
on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
users’
input
files.
On
top
of
that,
the
prediction
generated
by
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AutoPhrase
can
vary
according
to
the
data
that
it
was
trained
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on.
We
decided
to
train
AutoPhrase
on
three
types
of
datasets,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table
1,
generating
three
types
of
models:
the
model
on
all
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
academic
papers,
models
on
specific
domains
and
models
on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
specific subdomains.

Pretrained Domain Datasets
 
4. METHODOLOGY
 
In
this
section,
we
explain
how
the
recommender
system
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AutoLibrary
works.
First,
it
introduces
the
phrase
mining
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
method
AutoPhrases
with
its
two
novel
technologies
created
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by
Jingbo
Shang.
Second,
it
demonstrates
how
to
utilize
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
self-created
domain
datasets
to
apply
weight
to
the
results
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
improve
the
performance.
Finally,
it
discusses
how
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
overcome
the
anti-scraping
technology
of
Semantic
Scholar
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
display
the
information
we
collected
on
AutoLibrary.
We
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
use
Django
framework
to
build
our
website
with
those
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
front-end and back-end methods.
 
4.1 AutoPhrase
 
The
AutoPhrase
method
[1]
uses
(1)
robust
positive-only
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
distant
training
which
generates
positive
labels
samples
from
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
domain’s
public
general
knowledge
bases
to
replace
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
manual
work
of
domain
expert’s
work
and
(2)
POS
tags
which
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
utilizes
basic
language-specific
knowledge
in
the
process
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
phrasal
segmentation
so
that
AutoPhrase
is
applicable
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
different languages.

4.1.1 Robust Positive-Only Distant Training
 
This
technique
uses
general
knowledge
bases
like
Wikipedia
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
eliminate
the
need
for
domain
experts
to
manually
label
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
candidate
phrases
with
binary
labels
[1].
Candidate
phrases
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from
the
corpus
that
match
the
high
quality
phrases
from
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
general
knowledge
base
are
routed
to
the
positive
pool.
The
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
inferior
phrases
leftover
are
routed
to
the
negative
pool.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However,
because
not
all
high
quality
phrases
may
be
in
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
general
knowledge
base,
some
phrases
could
have
been
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
incorrectly
routed
to
the
negative
pool,
resulting
in
a
noisy
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
negative pool.
 
Figure 1
 
 Illustration of a Base Classifier
 
 
Next
we
train
an
ensemble
classifier
that
takes
the
average
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
results
of
T
independent
base
classifiers
[1].
As
shown
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure
1,
for
each
base
classifier,
K
labels
are
sampled
from
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
each
of
the
pools
as
a
size-2K
subset.
In
the
sampled
negative
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pool,
there
could
be
𝜹
wrongly
labeled
phrases
that
should
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have
been
positive,
which
is
why
it
is
a
perturbed
training
set.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To
handle
such
a
noisy
negative
pool,
we
train
an
unpruned
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
decision
tree
because
of
its
low
training
error.
As
long
as
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
positive
and
negative
phrase
in
the
perturbed
training
set
have
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
different
feature
representations,
accuracy
will
always
be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
100%.
In
this
case
the
ideal
error
is
when
there
are
𝜹
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
δ
2
K
 
 
 
 
 
phrases
out
of
the
size-2K
subset
that
were
in
the
wrong
pool,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which
is
exactly
the
number
of
phrases
that
were
incorrectly
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
routed
to
the
negative
pool.
We
take
the
average
from
T
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
independently
trained
ensemble
classifiers
as
an
additional
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
measure
for
reducing
noise.
A
phrase’s
quality
score
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
defined
as
the
fraction
of
these
decision
trees
predicted
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
phrase
to
be
a
quality
phrase
[1].
Thus
the
ensemble
error
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
defined
as
how
likely
more
than
half
of
the
classifiers
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
misclassify
the
phrase.
As
T
becomes
larger,
the
ensemble
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
error will approach zero.
 
 
 
 
4.1.2 POS-Guided Phrasal Segmentation
 
There
are
two
parts
to
this
process
[1].
The
first
is
to
tag
words
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with
their
POS
(part-of-speech)
and
create
a
sequence
of
pairs
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
out
of
the
corpus,
where
a
pair
is
and
each
pair
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
,
t
 
<
w
i
 
i
>
 
 
 
 
 
represented
by
a
.
Thus
the
corpus
becomes
a
word
 
 
 
Ω
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sequence
=
where
each
word
is
POS-tagged.
 
Ω

.

The
second
is
the
phrasal
segmentation
process
which
builds
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on
the
pairs.
This
process
creates
segments
out
of
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
m
 
 
 
 
 
sequence,
each
segment
separated
using
a

that

As
mentioned
above,
AutoPhrase
is
built
for
extracting
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
high-quality
phrases
from
large
text
corpora
and
utilizes
an
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ensemble
classifier,
a
group
of
unpruned
decision
trees,
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reduce
the
noise
in
the
negative
sample
groups.
The
final
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
quality
score
depends
on
the
ratio
of
decision
trees
that
mark
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
phrase
as
quality
phrases.
Thus
its
quality
evaluations
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
phrases
in
a
single
document
might
be
unreliable,
since
it
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
could
not
generate
enough
decision
trees.
At
the
same
time,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
assessment
based
on
POS
tagging
makes
the
entity
names
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
always
have
high
quality
scores,
although
some
entities
have
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
low frequencies and are not domain-specific.

To
handle
the
biased
quality
evaluation,
we
have
to
apply
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
weight
to
the
quality
scores
of
the
phrases
again
based
on
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
phrases’
corresponding
quality
scores
in
their
domains.
We
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have
prepared
a
dataset
that
consists
of
AutoPhrase
results
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
almost
all
the
STEM
(science,
technology,
engineering
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mathematics)
domains.
Each
AutoPhrase
result
is
generated
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from
corpora
that
contain
thousands
of
abstracts
and
titles
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
scientific
articles
within
the
domain.
Since
the
quality
score
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
already
standardized,
ranging
from
0
to
1,
the
most
efficient
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
way
to
apply
weight
is
simply
multiplying
the
quality
scores
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
the
same
phrases
for
the
input
document
x
and
its
domain
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
using
the
formula
above.
The
weighted
quality
score
not
only
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
could
reassess
the
significance
of
the
phrase
according
to
both
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
input
document
and
the
domain,
but
also
could
filter
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
entities
that
are
created
by
the
document
itself
and
would
not
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
contribute to finding other similar works.
 
 
 
 
4.3 Web Scraping
 
We
decided
to
take
advantage
of
the
paper
datasets
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
information
of
other
well
known
scholar
paper
libraries,
such
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as
Google
Scholar,
arXiv
and
Semantic
Scholar.
We
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
eventually
chose
Semantic
Scholar
because
it
provides
good
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
search
results
and
contains
a
huge
paper
dataset,
and
it
allows
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
users
to
specify
which
field
of
studies
to
search
from.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore,
we
found
a
good
API
from
the
website
which
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
can use to scrape data.
 
 
In
our
project,
we
set
up
a
Flask
backend
that
is
responsible
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for
accepting
keywords
and
field
of
studies
from
the
frontend,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
use
them
to
search
for
scholarly
articles
by
using
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Semantic Scholar API. The workflow can be seen in Figure 2.
 
Figure 2
 
Workflow of the Application
 
 
The
data
returned
from
Semantic
Scholar
is
a
json
string,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which
consists
of
lots
of
metadata
of
papers.
We
extracted
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
useful
ones
in
our
backend,
such
as
dates,
abstracts
and
titles,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
formulating
them
into
another
json
string
and
returned
to
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
frontend.
 
 
5. EXPERIMENTS
 
To
test
the
performance
of
our
digital

we
tested
it
with
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
three

5.1 Dataset
 
We
selected
eight
papers,
each
of
which
corresponds
to
eight
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
arXiv
domains.
In
this
way,
we
can
test
the
performance
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
different
analyzers
across
different
domains.
Table
3
shows
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
their information.
 
Table 3:
 
8 Papers Selected
 
 
5.2 Compared Similar Applications
 
We
found
another
three
text
analyzers
to
compare
with
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AutoPhrase.
They
are
the
Jstor
text
analyzer,
Webtools
text
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
analyzer,
and
MonkeyLearn
text
analyzer.
Due
to
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
characteristics
unique
to
each
analyzer,
we
used
different
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
measures to  explore their results.
 
For
AutoPhrase,
we
used
models
corresponding
to
papers’
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
domains
to
get
the
weighted
quality
scores,
as
discussed
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
section
4.2.
We
then
manually
label
the
phrases
as
positive
or
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
negative
quality-phrases
with
1
or
0.
The
quality
scores
given
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by
AutoPhrase
and
our
manual
labels
were
then
used
to
draw
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
precision-recall
curve.
Note
that
for
each
domain,
we
only
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
used the first 40 phrases to compare.
 
For
the
Jstor
text
analyzer,
we
viewed
the
extracted
topics
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from
the
uploaded
files
as
quality
phrases
extracted
by
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
analyzer.
Since
it
doesn’t
have
a
quality
score,
we
tested
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
performance
by
computing
the
percentage
of
quality
phrases
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
amongst
the
extracted
ones.
We
manually
labelled
them
as
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
positive
or
negative
quality
phrases,
according
to
the
relevance
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
between
the
phrases
and
the
topics
of
the
papers.
The
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
percentage
was
then
computed
by
taking
the
mean
of
the
label
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vector.
 
Webtools
text
analyzer
ranks
keywords
and
phrases
according
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
their
frequencies
in
the
document.
We
only
selected
phrases
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(with
at
least
two
words)
to
avoid
common
single
words
such
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as
“is”,
“the”,
and
etc.
We
scaled
the
frequencies
by
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
standardizing
them
to
the
scale
of
[0,
1].
Then
we
manually
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
labelled
the
phrases
as
positive
or
negative
quality.
Then
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
scaled
quality
scores
and
the
manual
labels
were
then
used
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
draw the precision-recall curve.
 
MonkeyLearn
text
analyzer
is
a
pretrained
model
for
keyword
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
extraction.
We
don’t
know
its
implementation
but
it
should
be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
competent
in
the
industry
since
the
startup
company
that
built
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
analyzer
provides
pricing
plans
for
product
teams
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
developers
to
use
their
text
analysis
APIs.
The
keywords
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
results
are
similar
to
Jstor
in
the
sense
that
they
both
didn’t
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have
quality
scores.
So
we
manually
gave
them
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
positive-or-negative
labels
as
we
did
to
Jstor
results.
Then
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
computed
the
percentage
of
quality
phrases
by
taking
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mean
of
the
label
vector.
Note
that
this
analyzer
only
provides
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10
quality
phrases,
as
opposed
to
40
in
the
case
of
Jstor
quality
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
phrases. So we compared them separately.

Figure

shows
the
precision-recall
curves
of
all
eight
papers
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
under AutoLibrary and Webtools.
 
Figure 3
 
Comparison between AutoLibrary and Webtools
 
 
 
 
From
Figure
3
we
can
see
that
the
area
under
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
precision-recall
curve
of
AutoLibrary
is
bigger
than
that
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Webtools
in
all
eight
domains.
This
means
that
AutoLibrary
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
performs
better
than
the
Webtools
analyzer
across
different
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
domains.
It
makes
sense
intuitively
since
the
latter
one
is
very
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
simple.
Its
results
often
contain
non-quality
phrases,
such
as
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“of
the”,
“can
be”,
and
etc.
Moreover,
in
the
domain
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Quantitative
Finance,
where
there
were
lots
of
mathematical
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
equations,
the
Webtools
analyzer
failed
to
filter
out
symbols
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
like “t
​
s
​
”.
 
When
comparing
AutoPhrase
and
the
Jstor
analyzer,
we
used
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a
histogram
plot
to
compare
their
percentages
of
quality
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
phrases in their extracted phrases.
 
Figure 4
 
Percentage of Quality Phrases in Top 40 Extracted
 
Phrases
 
We can see that in all domains, AutoLibrary performs better
 
than the Jstor analyzer. The main con of Jstor is that its
 
recommendation is based on a fixed set of predefined topics.
 
Therefore, it cannot make customized recommendations for
 
specific papers. For example, when analyzing a statistics
 
paper, it recommended “debt collection”, which doesn’t even
 
exist in the original text. In contrast, AutoLibrary first extracts
 
phrases from the input paper, which improves the contingency
 
between the quality phrases and the original paper.
 
 
Another big shortcoming of Jstor is that the topics it
 
recommends are sometimes too general. Although they make
 
sense in English, they don't qualify as quality phrases. For
 
example, when analyzing the Computer Science paper, one of
 
the phrases extracted is “computer programming.” It doesn’t
 
really help users since it’s too general for them to search for
 
related papers.
 
Last but not least, Jstor doesn’t offer quality scores to
 
recommended phrases, which means that users don’t know
 
which phrases can best represent their input papers.
 
AutoLibrary, on the other hand, ranks the top 5 phrases in
 
order, so that users can have a better overview of the papers.
 
Next we experimented with MonkeyLearn. Note that we only
 
compared the top ten phrases from both AutoLibrary and
 
MonkeyLearn, since the latter one only provides 10 keywords
 
and phrases. The result comparison can be seen in Figure 5.
 
  
Figure 5
 
Percentage of Quality Phrases in Top 10 Extracted
 
Phrases
 
From the figure, we can see that AutoPhrase outperformed
 
MonkeyLearn in all domains. One big disadvantage of
 
MonkeyLearn we found is that it probably relies heavily on
 
the frequency of phrases. Although it can extract some really
 
meaningful phrases amongst its top 5 phrases, it also
 
recommends some phrases that make no sense. For example,
 
when analyzing the Mathematics paper, it extracted ""a1 a2
 
a1"", ""a2 a1 a2"" and ""a1 a2 a0"" amongst the top 10 phrases. We
 
believe that AutoLibrary defeats MonkeyLearn by weighting
 
phrases against domain knowledge pools, which eliminates the
 
reckless ones.
 
5.4 Result Analysis
 
We perform a result analysis of our model in two aspects:
 
1.
Whether
the
model
is
able
to
differentiate
similar
papers
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
published
by
the
same
author,
while
at
the
same
time
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
discovering their shared topics;
 
2.
Whether
the
model
is
able
to
give
precise
results
compared
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to manual labeling.
 
We select 5 papers published by Professor Shang:
 
Table 4:
 
5 Papers Published by Professor Shang
 
First,
we
get
the
AutoPhrase
results
for
all
5
papers.
The
top
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10
quality
phrases
are
displayed
in
Table

There
are
some
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
phrases,
such
as
""maccabi

""jiawei
han,""
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
""california,""
that
ended
up
at
the
top
of
the
ranked
list
while
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
they are actually not domain-specific.

​
Quality Score Distribution before & after Weighting: The quality score distribution shifts to the left after applying the weight.
 
This is expected because scores of nonsignificant phrases are weighted down
 
 
Thus
to
filter
out
these
nonsignificant
phrases,
our
model
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
applies
weight
to
the
AutoPhrase
result
using
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pre-processed
arXiv
dataset.
For
pre-processing,
we
have
split
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
arXiv
dataset
into
domains
and
run
AutoPhrase
on
each
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
them
to
get
domain
specific
phrases.
For
the
5
papers
we
are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
using,
we
select
the
domain
to
be
""computer
science""
and
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
top 10 quality phrases are displayed in Table 6.
 
As
we
can
see,
there
are
some
phrases,
such
as
""natural
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
language,""
""pos
tagging,""
and
""text
corpora,""
shared
across
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
these
5
papers,
as
highlighted.
At
the
same
time,
each
of
these
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
papers
has
its
own
unique
phrases,
such
as
""cross
validation""
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for
CrossWeigh,
""knowledge
base""
for
AutoPhrase,
""sequence
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
labeling""
for
LM-LSTM-CRF,
""distant
supervision""
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
AutoNER,
and
""bipartite
graph""
for
SetExpan.
It
proves
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
our
model
is
able
to
differentiate
similar
papers
published
by
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
same
author,
while
at
the
same
time
discovering
their
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
shared topics.
 
Next,
we
annotate
the
weighted
results
by
manually
checking
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
labeling
whether
the
phrases
can
actually
represent
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
paper.
To
visualize
the
performance
of
our
model
on
the
5
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
selected
papers,
Fig.
7
presents
the
precision-recall
curves.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Then
we
compare
the
accuracy
for
phrases
with
a
quality
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
score > 0.5, > 0.6, and > 0.7, as shown in Table 7.
 
 
Fig.
7.
Precision-Recall

Results
of
5
Selected
Papers:
Looking
at
the
area
under
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
curve
(AUC),
a
high
AUC
indicates
that
our
model
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
successfully
extracts
phrases
that
can
actually
represent
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
paper.
In
addition,
as
the
size
of
the
weighted
results
is
small,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
especially
for
AutoNER
and
CrossWeigh,
AUC
is
higher
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
these two papers.
 
 
 
  
Table 7:
 
Accuracy of Weighted Results against Manual Labeling
 
 
As
we
can
see
from
the
dataframe
above,
accuracy
is
higher
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for
phrases
with
a
higher
quality
score.
Since
our
model
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
using
the
top
3
quality
phrases,
it
is
able
to
give
precise
results
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compared to manual labeling.
 
 
6. CONCLUSIONS
 
In
conclusion,
we
used
AutoPhrase
as
our
keyword
extractor
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
pretrained
domain
models
to
weight
quality
scores.
In
this
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
way,
we
successfully
combine
the
merit
of
high
quality
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
domain
phrases
and
customization
of
specific
papers.
The
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
accuracy
score
of
our
keyword
extraction
was
proved
to
be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
higher
than
existing
text
analyzers,
including
other
scholar
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
paper
search
engines.
This
advantage
is
held
across
all
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
domains, thus making it a domain-independent search engine.
 
Our
web
application
easies
the
pain
point
in
existing
digital
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
libraries
that
cannot
recommend
related
papers
according
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
specific
topics
and
field
of
studies
of
given
papers.
It
extracts
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
accurate
quality
phrases
from
specific
papers
to
make
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
customized
recommendations,
which
allows
users
to
easily
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
find
keywords
of
a
given
paper
and
further
explore
fields
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
they are not familiar with.
 
However,
our
application
has
some
limitations
right
now
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
we
will
improve
it
in
the
future.
First
of
all,
we
can
improve
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
runtime
as
it
would
take
a
much
longer
time
to
run
if
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
multiple
users
are
using
it
at
the
same
time.
Second,
as
our
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
application
only
supports
STEM
domains
right
now,
we
could
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
add
more
scientific
domains
in
the
future.
Third,
we
can
have
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a
user
management
system
so
that
users
could
use
different
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
devices and browsers to access their uploaded documents.

 ","AutoLibrary is a personal digital library that helps readers find related works by using a text analyzer called AutoPhrase. It addresses the challenge of finding related works when readers are not familiar with the domain of the papers they are reading. Traditional recommendation models based on user profile and collection data are not applicable in this scenario. AutoLibrary utilizes AutoPhrase, a domain-independent phrase mining method, to extract quality phrases from scientific papers. Users can input a scientific paper and get the most related papers based on the top three keywords generated by AutoPhrase. They can also customize the selection of keywords or enter their own keywords to explore other related works. AutoLibrary outperforms other similar text analyzer applications across different scientific fields, providing a personalized user experience for finding related papers in various domains and subdomains."

Abstract
Over time, we rely more and more heavily on online platforms such as Netix, Amazon, Spotify, which
are embedded with the recommendation system in the applications. They know users' preferences by
collecting their ratings, recording the clicks, combing the reviews and then recommending more items. In
building the recommender system, review texts can hold the same importance as the numerical statistics
because they contain key phrases that characterize how they felt about the review. For this project,
we propose to build the recommender system with primary focus on the text reviews analysis through
TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) and AutoPhrase and to add targeted segmented
analysis on phrases to attach sentiments to aspects of a restaurant to rank those recommendations. The
ultimate goal is designing a website for deploying our recommender system and showing its functionality.
1 Introduction
Many recommender systems use ratings as an in-
dicator of a user's sentiment towards a business, and
remains the most popular and most used feature in
terms of determining whether or not a business is
`good'. However, without utilizing the text of the re-
views, most users will be left in the dark in regards to
the features they may not realize would be important
to them in data that simply cannot be represented in
numbers. There are multiple factors that go into a
rating: wait time, service, quality of food, cleanliness
or even atmosphere - for example, a restaurant could
have positive sentiment towards the food but nega-
tive sentiment towards the wait time. In order to
solve this problem, our aim is to include such senti-
ments that can be found in the review text and turn
that into data which can be used to further improve
business recommendations to users. In order to do
this, we extract the review text from a dataset of re-
views and businesses and segment the text using a
program called AutoPhrase. Afterwards, sentiment
analysis is performed on the text segments which will
reveal what parts of the text have positive or nega-
tive sentiment. This, coupled with the workings of
a standard recommender system, should give users
more interesting and personalized recommendations
when it comes to businesses.
In investigations into prior recommender sys-
tems, many utilized a process known as Collabora-
tive Filtering, which is a technique that collects data
regarding user preferences and recommends items
based upon the similarities of the users, and is usedin many recommender systems. Other methods used
in recommender systems include Alternating Least
Squares, K-Nearest Neighbors and Stochastic Gradi-
ent Descent, among others. Such techniques are well
regarded and highly used, but noticeably lack com-
ponents that take advantage of text data, which has
the potential to increase the accuracy and personal-
ization of the recommendations given. Given that
text data reveals much into why users give certain
ratings, the text data can be used in order to create
new features, or can be applied in dierent ways that
can sort or rank businesses.
Much like previous works, the data used in
this project is the Yelp Academic Data set, which
is a dataset that was ocially created and released
to the public by Yelp and is used in many previ-
ous works in terms of recommender systems. This
dataset contains 5 JSON les, in total containing
data on roughly 5.2 million user reviews, 174,000
businesses, spanning 11 dierent metropolitan ar-
eas. Among this data, features such as business
id, user id, review id, text, rating, and more are
included in the data, which provides a more than
adequate amount of data to work with in order
to create a cohesive recommender system. For
the sake of our project, we focused mainly on
2 JSON les: yelp academic dataset business.json,
which contains information about businesses, as well
as yelp academic dataset review.json, which contains
information about reviews. Using these two les, we
can merge data frames on business ids in order to
track which businesses have good or bad reviews, and
associate review text to certain businesses.

2 Methods
Various methods were used in an attempt to ex-
periment with our recommender system in order to
determine which methods we would want to use in
our system.
2.1 TF-IDF Recommendation Method
We experiment two approaches to start building
our recommendation system { content-based and col-
laborative ltering. In preparation for the recom-
mender system analysis, we join the business dataset
and user dataset by the business id to get a more com-
prehensive dataset about the user and restaurants.2.1.1 Restaurant-Restaurant Based
The rst general approach we use to build a recom-
mendation system is building a content-based recom-
mender. The main idea is that: since each restaurant
has the record of user review and rating, it is accessi-
ble to generate each restaurant review document from
all its user reviews that can be used to recommend
restaurants based on document similarity. Then, we
decide to apply the method term frequency{inverse
document frequency (TF-IDF), which assigns each
word in a document a number that is proportional
to its frequency in the document and inversely pro-
portional to the number of documents in which it
occurs.
For implementation, with the joined business
and review dataset, we group the restaurant by its
business id, combine all user reviews on it within
2a document and calculate the average rating of all
users' reviews on it. After getting each restaurant's
document, we perform the data cleaning procedure
to remove the unnecessary punctuation, extra space
and lowercase all the words in the document to keep
the consistency.
Then, for each restaurant, we run the term fre-
quency{inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) Vec-
torizer to get the word distribution of each restau-
rant's review document. [4] The ngram parameter
we choose for the TF-IDF vectorizer ranges from 1 to
3, which means we care about the single word phrase
as well as possible two-word phrases and three-word
phrases in our vectorizer process. The result of TF-
IDF vectorizer throughout the whole grouped restau-
rant dataset has a signicant number of entries (more
than 100000), which means the vectorized phrases en-
tries for the all restaurant are plentiful.
As for generating the recommended restau-
rants, we apply the cosine similarity to the TF-IDF
vectorizer to get a similarity score matrix for all
restaurants in the dataset.
This similarity measures the cosine of the angle
between the two vectors (A, B) being compared.The
lower the angle between two vectors, the higher the
cosine will be, hence yielding a higher similarity fac-
tor. The score of similarity ranges from -1 to 1,
where 1 means exactly the same and -1 means op-
posite at all. In our case, if two restaurants' TF-
IDF vectors preserve a high cosine score, it tells us
that two restaurants have similar review word distri-
bution, which is reasonable to recommend one while
the user is querying another.
After generating the cosine matrix, we can eas-
ily generate a list of recommended restaurants given
a sample restaurant business id we are interested in.
We search through the cosine matrix and pop up
the top N restaurants which have the closest simi-larity scores with our target restaurant. In case of
the tie recommended restaurants, we decide to rank
the restaurants based on the user's average rating. In
the future, we might leave the option of ltering to
the user.
2.1.2 User-User Based
The second general approach we experiment is to
build a collaborative ltering recommender. The
main idea is to generate the review document
for each user and recommend similar users based
on the similarity of their review word distribu-
tion. The experimenting procedure for this user-
user based method matches with the restaurant-
restaurant based method. We rst combine the user
review into one document and preprocess the review
document for further TF-IDF vectorizer method.
Then, we apply the TF-IDF vectorizer and use cosine
similarity as evaluation criteria for recommending the
similar users.
But we face quite a lot of challenges in the ex-
periment. The most inuential one is that our -
nal website does not preserve a user property since
we neither have actual active users as support of our
database nor enable users to add review dynamically.
Under such circumstances, without a unique user pro-
le section, the user-user approach can not work at
all because we can not link a user with another user
in lack of their user information. Besides, in our ex-
ploration, we nd a signicant number of users from
our dataset that only contain less than two review
records. While searching for similar users of this
kind of users, the results are quite biased because the
user review document might only contain one sen-
tence with very limited information and less repre-
sentative word distribution. Without a good solution
to handle these diculties, we decide not to include
this method in our implementation eventually.
2.2 Food Query Using Targeted Sen-
timent Analysis
Based on a food query like fried chicken, our rec-
ommender system will list the top ve recommended
restaurants using targeted sentiment analysis. Senti-
ment analysis determines whether a given review has
positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Polarity-
based sentiment analysis is a binary output, while
valence-based sentiment analysis is a continuous out-
put of how positive or negative the document is [2].
A subset of sentiment analysis is called targeted sen-
timent analysis. Instead of nding the sentiment of
a particular review, we want to nd the sentiment
3towards particular aspects in a review: customer ser-
vices, popular dishes, etc.
The rst step is preprocessing the reviews
text using AutoPhrase, an automatic phrase mining
method that uses Wikipedia's database to nd andannotate the highest quality single-word and multi
word phrases. We trained the model on Yelp reviews
text, then performed the phrasal segmentation step
to annotate reviews text. Each phrase is annotated
with \ <phrase >...</phrase >"" [3].
Original \The fried chicken was delicious!""
AutoPhrase \The <phrase >fried chicken </phrase >was delicious!""
VADER 'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.501, 'pos': 0.499, 'compound': 0.6114
Positive Mentions fried chicken: 1
Table 3: An example of how targeted sentiment analysis works.
Next we run sentiment analysis on each sen-
tence. The sentiment of the sentence is related
to the sentiment towards the phrase. For exam-
ple, if we had a sentence like \The <phrase >fried
chicken </phrase >was delicious!"", the phrase fried
chicken has a positive sentiment.
To perform sentiment analysis we use a valence-
based sentiment analysis tool called VADER (Valence
Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner). VADER
is a pre-trained model provided by NLTK (Natural
Language ToolKit), a package that includes text pro-
cessing functionalities. Training a model from scratch
requires expensive resources (time, people), while the
ratings in VADER have been previously trained by
people's ratings [2].
For each word in a text it will assign it a value[-1, 1] of how positive or negative it is. For example,
a word like \great"" has a higher value than \good"".
VADER has four kinds of metrics: negative, neutral,
positive, and compound. The rst three describe the
percentage of the sentence that falls under those cat-
egories. The compound is the sum of these values
[2].
If the compound score for a sentence is greater
than 0.3, then the phrase in that sentence is marked
as positive. For each restaurant we aggregate these
positive phrases by their total count. When a user
queries for \fried chicken"", we will sort our list based
on the most positive mentions of \fried chicken"". If
there is a tie, the secondary ordering is based on the
highest average star rating.

For the results section, we present a few case stud-
ies to evaluate how our recommendations perform
by comparing our recommendation result with Yelp's
search result. The cases below are generated with
the location as Las Vegas because that is the city for
which we have the most reviews.For the restaurant query, the evaluation will fo-
cus on the relevance of results, quality of results and
quantitative comparison. For the phrase query, the
evaluation will focus on three aspects: the relevance
of the results, the quality of the results, and other
uses for our results.

84 Discussion
4.1 Interpreting Results
For the restaurant search query, when we searched
for recommendations of some common and popular
restaurants, the results of our recommender website
and Yelp website mostly match with each other. As
seen in Table 7, we tried a few popular restaurants
such as KFC, Pho Kim Long, Sunrise Coee, the re-
sults between our recommendations and Yelp's rec-
ommendations either had an overlap or were dierent
restaurants with similar tags, which are hard to tell
if our recommender website is better. But as we tried
the restaurant that is not that popular, probably does
not have a chain store at all, our recommender system
did give a more comprehensive result.
Figure 1 shows the information of our outper-
formed query restaurant Bellagio Patisserie, which is
a Coee & Tea & Desserts restaurant inside a 4.5 star
Hotel { Bellagio Hotel. Furthermore, in Las Vegas,
there is only one such hotel and restaurant. Then,
while searching for recommendation restaurants of
such a special and unique restaurant, our top two rec-
ommended restaurants are completely dierent from
the Yelp search results.
In Figures 2 and 3, we can see that our top two
recommended restaurants both contain the Cafe &
Tea tag while Yelp search results surprisingly gave
botanical garden as the most similar result, which
does not belong to a restaurant at all. It is easy to see
that our recommender system popped up two more
acceptable restaurants that highly matches with the
tag of the search query restaurant.
However, we still need to compare if the cuisines
or dishes are kind of similar between the query
restaurant and results. In Table 6, we clearly ob-
serve that our query restaurant is popular for the
desserts like Nutella Crepe, Chocolate Almond Crois-
sant, Tiramisu, which perfectly matches with its Yelp
category tag. And our two recommended restau-
rants both have Tiramisu and some kind of choco-
late cakes as popular dishes, in comparison with the
popular dishes (Eggs benedict, Sticky bun, French
toast) of Yelp recommended restaurants. With such
a high consistency between our recommended restau-
rants and the query restaurant, we are condent that
our restaurant recommendation method gives a bet-
ter result than Yelp website.
When we tried dierent queries we found that
with general foods such as pizza, burgers, fried
chicken, etc., the results between our recommenda-
tions and Yelp's recommendations had many over-
laps, which is interesting considering we are only us-ing text data in our rankings. Number of stars are
only used to break ties. For very specic dishes, our
recommender system found the restaurants that had
the highest positive mentions of that dish, but the top
5 Yelp restaurants recommended did not have some
of these dishes in their reviews.
Figure 4 shows an example of what our top two
recommended restaurants would be in Las Vegas for
fried chicken. From the summary we can understand
that Yardbird has more positive sentiment towards
their fried chicken, while MTO Cafe has more posi-
tive sentiment towards their service. Depending on
how much our user considers the importance of food
or service, they can decide which best ts their crite-
ria, without having to read a single Yelp review.
As shown in Table 7, our ability to search for
relevant restaurants for specic terms is stronger than
Yelp's. Given our limited and older dataset of Las Ve-
gas, we were able to nd those dishes in the restau-
rants that Yelp could not nd. For the german soft
pretzel query, the top Yelp recommended restaurant
did not sell any pretzels.
In the case study analyzing the quality of our
search, initially it seems odd that we would recom-
mend a vegan restaurant for a chicken dish, as shown
in Table 8, but it was the most popular dish listed
for Veggie House, with more reviews/photos about
their orange chicken than for Gourmet China. Our
recommender system was able to nd a restaurant
where more people enjoyed the orange chicken dish
than Yelp's.
Tables 9 and 10 showcase how our query can be
extended to beyond food. Our results oer a greater
variety of categories (French, Japanese), while Yelp's
results were both American (New). Americana has a
slightly higher average star rating, while Bouchon has
6.6 times the number of reviews. There were 16-17
reviews relating to Mother's day in each restaurant.
However, Bouchon had more 4+ stars Mother's day
reviews and less <=3 stars Mother's day reviews than
Americana. It is clear that a majority of people en-
joyed Mother's day at our top recommended restau-
rant, while there was mixed sentiment at Yelp's top
recommended restaurant. Our ability to perform tar-
geted sentiment analysis for Mother's day exceeded
Yelp's search result.
4.2 Impact and Applicability
While comparing our recommendations to the rec-
ommendations found on Yelp's own website, it can
be dicult to determine, or even say at all, that our
results are superior to Yelp's. However, one impor-
tant factor to consider is that our recommender sys-
9tem uses only the text data found in reviews in order
to make recommendations, with a small bit of sort-
ing by number of stars afterward - Such comparable
results using only text data showcases the hidden po-
tential of text data in general. With this point in
mind, projects like this will hopefully show that text
data is immensely useful and inspire others to utilize
text data in ways that consist of more than a simple
string searching function. Unfortunately, text data,
such as those in Yelp reviews, are more meant for
human consumption, and is considered unstructured
data. Therefore, unlike structured and even semi-
structured data, which can be sorted and stored on
tables for ease of use, text data is more likely to be
dicult to organize and work with.
In terms of general applicability, we feel as
though such techniques employed here would be bene-
cial for those with review posting functionality. For
example, using Targeted Sentiment Analysis on re-
view text could be done in order to more accurately
discover the grievances of consumers and allow com-
panies to address these grievances without reserving
human labor to reading reviews or even having to sur-
vey their consumer base. On the other hand, compa-
nies should allow for users to search for products us-
ing this technique in order for the users to nd better
products that cater to their wants and needs. Overall,
analysis text data in this way could benet both com-
panies and consumers alike, giving companies ways to
tackle consumer concerns with more ease, and allow-
ing users to have more personalized recommendations
which may increase their overall satisfaction of the
company and its products.
4.3 Limitations
Our recommendations based on food are strong for
specic dishes that Yelp is unable to nd (i.e. bacon
breakfast sandwich). The biggest limitation that we
had is the size of our dataset. The academic dataset
that Yelp provides is a subset. So there are many
times that a direct comparison between Yelp's and
our results is not a good one because there are restau-
rants that will be recommended on Yelp that do notexist in the subset that we have.
Another limitation comes from the way we tok-
enize reviews for targeted sentiment analysis. We as-
sumed that each sentence in a review is either positive
or negative. A simple example is \The orange chicken
was good. But the customer service was bad."" How-
ever, we do not split compound sentences such as
\The orange chicken was good, but the customer ser-
vice was bad."" More often than not, we can nd the
aspects sentence by sentence, which allows us to nu-
merically summarize reviews in ways that Yelp is un-
able to (with our \Number of mentions"" and \Good
Service"").
4.4 Future Work
In the future we hope to use a method to separate
compound sentences in order to rene our targeted
sentiment analysis. Then those specic cases like
\we liked this, but not that"" would be separated into
two tokens: \we liked this"", \but not that"". Also,
for the restaurant query, we would like to try more
advanced models such as Alternating Least Square
(ALS) Matrix Factorization and latent Dirichlet allo-
cation (LDA). For our current exploration, the per-
formance using TF-IDF is better than Yelp only un-
der some circumstances. We want to make a better
algorithm (like LDA, ALS) to outperform Yelp search
results under more general circumstances.
Currently the aspects we can summarize are the
number of times the query was present and the num-
ber of times reviews have positive sentiment towards
service. There are many more we could incorporate
into the website such as waittime, cleanliness, atmo-
sphere, etc. This would provide an even better sum-
mary of a restaurant that users can use to evaluate
whether they want to go there.
Our recommender system takes advantage of
the phrases with the most positive sentiment. In fu-
ture work we could also explore how to use phrases
with negative sentiment, so that users can lter out
less desirable aspects (i.e. long wait time, slow
service) or so that restaurant owners can have an
overview of what aspect they can improve on.

that
solely
uses
a
textual
environment,
as
opposed
to
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
graphical
one.
The
website
interface
is
introduced
with
a
list
of
questions,
as
well
as
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sections
marked
by
Questions,
Tags,
Users,
and
Unanswered.
Additionally,
it
is
also
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
possible to sort by Active, by Bountied, or by question age.
 
However,
the
forum
currently
does
not
provide
certain
functionalities
tailored
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
towards
unanswered
questions,
which
are
plenty
on
this
forum.
When
selecting
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Unanswered
section,
users
are
able
to
sort
by
the
user’s
preselected
tags,
newest,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
votes,
or
questions
with
no
answers.
While
the
preselected
tags
might
offer
a
good
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
starting
point,
each
field
however
is
still
too
large
that
one
user’s
expertise
may
not
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cover
the
entirety
of
the
given
tag.
While
a
user
may
be
overly
familiar
with
the
current
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
version
of
Mac
OS,
they
may
not
even
have
user
previous
versions
of
Mac
OS,
which
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
could be a different architecture altogether, yet still falling under the same tag.
 
One
of
the
biggest
challenges
for
engaging
new
users
however
is
the
retention
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rate
of
new
users.
Existing
users
to
Super
User
might
already
have
some
semblance
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
an
idea
as
to
where
new
questions
can
be
answered,
but
novel
users
will
have
zero
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
idea
as
to
where
to
start.
ForumRec
primarily
aims
to
provide
a
better
starting
platform
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for
new
users,
or
“Cold
Start”
users.
Users
who
have
either
never
answered
any
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
questions
or
have
only
utilized
Super
User
a
handful
of
times
can
log
on
to
ForumRec
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be
provided
with
a
sampled
list
of
questions.
The
user
then
only
has
to
indicate
whether
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or
not
they
think
they
could
answer
each
of
these
questions
instead
of
actually
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
answering
them.
This
saves
the
user
time
in
prepping
the
user’s
account
for
our
model,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
instead
steering
the
user’s
interest
and
expertise
level
towards
the
sampled
questions.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These
indications
are
used
as
the
user’s
input
instead
of
previously
answered
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
questions, whereby recommendations are then provided to the user.
 
To
better
recommend
questions
for
users
to
answer,
analysis
of
the
content
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
needed
to
be
done.
We
used
content-based
and
collaborative
filtering
in
a
hybrid
model
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
using
the
LightFM
package
to
determine
the
interactions
and
relationships
between
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
users
and
certain
questions
in
the
data.
Natural
Language
Processing
(NLP)
with
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Term
Frequency
-
Inverse
Document
Frequency
(TF-IDF)
matrix
were
used
to
parse
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
given
textual
body
helping
the
model
provide
insight
towards
which
words
may
carry
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
more
significance
due
to
lowered
frequency,
or
use
in
specific
situations
with
other
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
words.
Along
with
a
one-hot
encoding
of
the
tag
data,
we
were
able
to
contrast
a
model
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
to
give
recommendations
to
users
based
on
their
question
history.
So,
for
a
given
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
are able to find the questions they are most likely to answer.
 
For
the
models
that
we
have,
we
need
to
compare
them
against
baseline
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ensure
that
the
work
we
are
doing
is
effective.
To
do
this,
we
used
the
strictly
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
collaborative
filtering
baseline
and
were
able
to
get
a
51.6%
AUC
score
compared
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
baseline’s
score
of
50.01%.
We
also
see
scores
of
0.14%
and
0.33%
for
the
model
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compared
to
the
baseline’s
scores
of
0.10%
and
0.27%
for
precision
and
recall
at
100
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
respectively.
 
 
 
 
  
Data
 
The
data
used
for
this
recommender
system
was
gathered
by
​
archive.org
and
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from
the
Super
User
forum
of
Stack
Exchange.
The
dataset
contained
information
on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
posts,
post
history
and
changes,
post
links,
comments,
badges,
tags,
users,
and
votes,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
however,
for
this
recommender
system,
we
used
a
subset
of
this
data.
We
used
posts
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
themselves
as
the
main
source
of
data.
In
posts
themselves,
we
maintained
the
id
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
post,
the
post
type
(question
or
answer),
the
creation
date
of
the
post,
the
score
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
post
(up
votes
and
down
votes
given
to
the
post),
the
text
of
the
post’s
body,
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tags
associated
with
the
post,
the
id
of
the
owner
of
the
post,
the
id
of
the
parent
post
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(only
used
for
answers
to
determine
the
question
they
are
associate
with),
and
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
number
of
answers
for
that
post.
With
these
pieces
of
information
we
believed
we
could
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
create
the
recommendation
system
we
were
striving
for.
We
could
use
the
text
of
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
body
to
do
NLP
based
analyses,
use
the
tags
to
categorize
and
potentially
find
similar
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
posts
in
space.
We
would
then
make
sure
to
associate
the
questions
people
have
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
answered,
their
answers,
and
partially
the
score
of
their
answers
to
them
to
be
able
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
determine
which
questions
they
would
be
best
to
answer.
The
recommendation
system
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
would
be
entirely
based
on
these
few
aspects
of
the
data,
however,
with
a
few
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
gigabytes
of
data,
we
believe
this
is
enough
to
build
this
recommendation
system,
as
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
we have enough data per most people to be able to get recommendations. [2]
 
To
get
more
relevant
data
for
our
model
to
be
accurate
on
recent
data
inputs,
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
split
the
data
to
focus
on
more
recent
posts.
All
the
data
had
the
attributes
listed
in
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
previous
paragraph
and
was
using
the
posts
data.
The
data
was
split
on
January
1,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2018
to
get
the
last
three
years
of
data.
We
also
made
sure
all
posts
in
the
dataset
were
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
questions
that
were
answered,
or
the
answers
to
those
particular
questions.
We
also
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
include
users
in
the
dataset
that
answered
at
least
25
questions
in
the
past
only.
This
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was
to
ensure
that
the
model
would
be
able
to
get
personalized
recommendations
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
users
as
we
needed
large
amounts
of
data
on
questions
they
have
previously
answered
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
build
more
robust
and
diverse
predictions.
We
did
previously
have
training
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
testing
data
split
on
the
last
year
3
months
of
data
when
we
attempted
to
use
a
cosine
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
similarity
model
with
NLP,
but
as
we
went
away
from
that
we
no
longer
split
the
data
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
into
training
and
testing
data.
We
instead
shifted
and
are
now
creating
a
hybrid
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
collaborative
filtering
and
content-based
filtering
model
to
create
our
interactions
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
get
predictions,
so
we
needed
to
use
all
the
data
to
create
our
matrix
and
did
not
split
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
data
into
training
and
testing
data
sets
as
the
model
does
that
itself.
We
would
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
instead
measure
how
our
predictions
would
result
from
within
the
matrix
that
we
build
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
between
questions
and
users.
This
gives
us
over
64000
questions
as
data
points
over
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
110000 answers as data points for our model.
 
 
Lastly,
we
also
are
gathering
data
from
the
Super
User
itself
using
the
Stack
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Exchange
API
[3].
We
are
able
to
gather
potentially
10000
data
points
daily
from
stack
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
exchange
itself,
and
this
data
is
being
used
for
the
user
interface
of
our
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommendation
system.
By
being
able
to
collect
data
from
Super
User
on
a
consistent
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
basis,
we
can
be
able
to
consistently
update
users
with
questions
relevant
to
them
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
through
our
front
end
interface
as
it
is
occurring.
This
data
is
filtered
to
only
the
Super
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
User
forum,
and
can
be
filtered
on
date
time
to
ensure
we
do
not
collect
posts
already
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
collected.
The
filter
also
has
the
score,
tags,
creation
date
in
unix
time,
post
type
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(question
or
answer),
title
and
body
of
the
data
available
for
us
through
the
API,
and
this
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is
all
that
is
needed
to
reflect
the
data
given
from
​
archive.org
​
’s
dataset.
We
have
taken
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
data
from
December
of
2020
to
the
beginning
of
March
and
added
that
data
to
our
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
model
in
order
to
keep
our
data
up
to
date.
We
then
update
our
data
every
3
days
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
keep
our
model
updated
and
provide
recommendations
for
newer
questions.
We
can
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
also
update
the
data
more
quickly
with
a
shorter
period
of
time
to
update
on
to
get
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
better and more relevant results.
 
 
 
 
 
  
Methodology
 
In
order
to
recommend
these
unanswered
questions
to
users,
we
initially
built
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommender
that
uses
linear
kernel
similarity
metrics
between
questions.
The
body
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
text
of
each
question
in
the
training
data
was
tokenized,
building
a
large
TFIDF
matrix.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This
model
would
take
in
the
index
of
a
forum
question,
it
would
then
use
the
TFIDF
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
matrix
to
compute
the
linear
kernel
similarity
scores
of
the
forum
question
against
all
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
other
questions.
They
would
then
be
sorted
and
cut
down
to
the
top
100
most
similar
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
questions,
and
the
model
would
then
return
the
set
of
users
who
have
answered
one
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
these
100
questions.
However,
this
model
had
many
shortcomings,
while
being
based
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
entirely
on
content
based
filtering,
it
had
no
means
to
optimize
the
weights
of
the
feature
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
matrices,
and
was
very
computationally
expensive
when
making
recommendations.
We
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
decided
to
switch
to
using
the
LightFM
package
to
create
our
model,
LightFM
gives
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
flexibility
to
create
a
hybrid
model
which
utilizes
both
content
based
and
collaborative
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
filtering.
To
use
this
the
data
had
to
first
be
reformatted
to
work
with
the
LightFM
model.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We
created
an
interactions
matrix
between
users
and
forum
questions,
each
interaction
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
represented
a
question
(corresponding
to
it’s
column)
which
was
answered
by
a
user
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(corresponding
to
its
row),
these
interactions
were
weighted
by
the
answer’s
score
(#
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
upvotes
-
#
of
downvotes).
The
TF-IDF
feature
matrix
was
already
in
the
proper
format,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
however
we
created
an
indice
for
each
forum
question
which
mapped
their
IDs
to
their
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
corresponding
row
in
the
feature
matrix
matrix.
We
also
created
additional
item
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
features
by
expanding
the
column
of
the
tags
attached
to
each
question
into
a
matrix
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
binary
variables
for
each
tag
(1
indicating
that
the
tag
was
used
in
the
question,
and
0
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
otherwise).
 
 
When
fitting
the
model
(during
development)
the
interactions
matrix
was
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
separated
into
training
and
test
data
with
a
70:30
split.
This
split
maintained
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
structure
of
the
matrix
(keeping
the
same
users
and
questions
for
both),
but
split
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
interaction
values
in
the
matrix.
This
meant
the
training
data
kept
70%
of
the
non-zero
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
matrix
values
(the
rest
being
changed
to
zero)
while
the
test
data
kept
the
30%
omitted
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from
the
training
data.
This
means
that
the
feature
matrix
did
not
have
to
be
split,
as
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
model
incorporates
all
of
the
questions
into
both
interaction
splits
(although
it
may
not
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
utilize
them
if
all
interaction
instances
of
a
question
were
omitted
from
the
training
data).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When
given
the
training
data,
The
model
fits
embeddings
for
users
and
items
in
a
way
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that
represents
user
preferences
in
questions
over
items.
When
the
embeddings
for
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
user
and
an
item
are
multiplied
together,
they
produce
item-user
pair
scores,
which
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
represent
the
likelihood
that
the
user
is
willing/capable
of
answering
the
specific
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
question.
These
embeddings
are
learned
through
stochastic
gradient
descent,
​
a
method
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
minimize
an
objective
loss
function
by
updating
the
parameters
(feature
weights
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
our
case)
in
the
opposite
direction
of
the
gradient
(slope)
of
the
objective
function.
Being
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
​
most
popular
choice
in
recommender
systems,
we
chose
WARP
as
our
objective
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
loss
function.
WARP
stands
for
Weighted
Approximate-Rank
Pairwise
loss,
it
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
optimizes
the
rank
of
positive
examples
by
repeatedly
sampling
negative
examples
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
until
a
rank
violating
one
is
found.
It
is
generally
used
when
only
positive
interactions
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
are
present,
thus
given
the
sparsity
of
the
negative
examples
in
our
data,
it
was
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
considered the best choice of loss function.
 
 
Analysis
 
To
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
our
recommender,
specifically
the
effectiveness
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
it’s
content
based
filtering,
we
built
a
baseline
model
that
uses
only
collaborative
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
filtering
in
making
its
recommendations.
This
means
that
the
baseline
model
was
fitted
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
the
interactions
matrix,
but
was
not
given
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
item
features
which
are
needed
for
content
based
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
filtering.
Despite
neither
model
giving
high
values
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on
the
evaluation
metrics
due
to
the
sparsity
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
scale
of
the
interactions,
our
hybrid
model
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
out-performed
the
baseline
on
all
evaluation
 
 
 
 
 
 
metrics.
The
hybrid
model
achieved
a
precision
at
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
100
score
of
0.0014
on
test
data,
while
the
baseline
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
scored
0.0010,
precision
at
100
represents
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
average
fractions
of
known
positives
(questions
 
 
 
 
 
 
answered
by
the
user)
in
their
top
100
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommendations,
meaning
that
there
were
on
 
 
 
 
 
 
average
0.14
and
0.10
known
positives
in
a
users
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
top
100
recommendations
for
the
hybrid
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
baseline
model
respectively.
While
these
numbers
 
 
 
 
 
 
may
seem
very
small,
there
are
over
40,000
forum
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
questions
in
the
interactions
matrix,
with
roughly
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10-20
known
positives
per
user
on
average,
meaning
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that
a
recommender
working
completely
at
random
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
would
have
a
far
lower
score.
Our
next
evaluation
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
metric
was
recall
at
100,
the
number
of
known
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
positives
in
a
users
top
100
recommendations
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
divided
by
their
total
number
of
known
positives.
The
hybrid
model
achieved
an
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
average
recall
at
100
score
of
0.0033
while
the
baseline
scored
0.0027,
again
while
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
these
numbers
seem
small,
a
random
recommender
(which
would
randomly
sample
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
100
questions
out
of
the
41,524
in
the
data)
would
have
an
average
recall
at
100
equal
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
.
Our
final
evaluation
metric
was
the
AUC
score,
which
is
the
 
0
0
1
,
2
4
 
0
.
0
0
2

1
÷

=
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
probability
that
a
randomly
chosen
positive
example
is
ranked
higher
than
a
random
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
negative
(or
null)
value,
with
the
hybrid
model
scoring
0.5160
and
the
baseline
scoring
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
0.5001.
 
 
 
  
Website
 
For ForumRec, we decided to output our recommender system onto a website.
 
Our website is jackzlin.com [4]. It was hosted using Heroku [5] and we used an S3
 
Bucket from AWS [6] to manage our data and our model.
 
 
Handling
of
user
input
utilized
a
conjunction
of
services.
Initially,
the
user
loads
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
website,
and
signs
in
using
either
a
new
or
existing
Stack
Overflow
or
Super
User
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
account
[A1].
The
login
uses
StackApps
API
to
handle
user
authentication,
which
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
returns
user
credentials
for
the
website
to
use.
Upon
return,
the
user’s
id
is
then
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
checked
internally
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
user
meets
the
requirements
to
be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
given
recommendations
for
questions
to
answer,
or
if
their
account
does
not
meet
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
threshold of answered questions and are therefore deemed a “Cold Start” user.
 
For
a
“Cold
Start”
user,
the
assumption
is
that
the
user
has
not
answered
enough
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
questions
for
the
recommender
to
accurately
predict
which
questions
would
be
suitable
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for
the
user
to
answer.
Instead
of
the
immense
effort
of
requiring
the
user
to
go
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
answer
enough
questions
on
the
forum,
we
instead
offer
the
user
a
list
of
popular
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
questions,
where
the
user
would
indicate
whether
or
not
they
think
they
could
answer
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
these
popular
questions
[A3].
These
popular
questions
were
part
of
the
training
data,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
the
question
list
is
pulled
from
a
PostgreSQL
table
stored
onto
AWS’
Relational
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Database
(RDS).
The
output
from
the
user
is
then
converted
into
CSV
format
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
stored onto AWS’ S3.
 
This
“Cold
Start”
problem
brings
a
problem
in
re-fitting
the
model.
It
is
possible
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
make
a
new
interaction
matrix
that
includes
these
new
users
as
well
as
the
users
which
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
initial
model
was
trained
on
and
then
train
an
entirely
new
model,
however,
this
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
not
computationally
efficient
to
do
for
every
new
“cold
start”
user
that
signs
up.
Feeding
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
these
recommendations
directly
into
the
model,
or
simply
appending
new
user
rows
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
training
data
is
not
viable
either
since
the
model
is
fitted
specifically
to
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dimensions
of
the
interaction
matrix.
The
model
learns
embeddings
for
each
user
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
item
through
matrix
factorization
(from
collaborative
filtering),
this
means
that
the
model
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
can
not
update
itself
(partially
fit)
on
an
interaction
matrix
of
a
different
size
than
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
initial
one.
We
solve
this
problem
by
creating
dummy
user
rows
and
item
columns
in
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
initial
interaction
matrix.
These
dummy
users
serve
as
placeholders
for
new
users
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have
no
interactions
thus
do
not
affect
the
collaborative
filtering
process
of
fitting
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
model.
New
users
are
then
mapped
to
these
dummy
indices,
and
their
response
to
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
list
of
popular
questions
is
used
to
create
a
new
interactions
matrix.
This
new
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
interactions
matrix
only
contains
the
interactions
of
the
new
user
(about
10
non
zero
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
values)
but
maintains
the
same
dimensions
of
the
original
matrix.
This
allows
the
model
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
be
partially
fit
to
these
new
users
(allowing
the
model
to
effectively
give
them
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
recommendations),
without
the
need
to
refit
the
model
for
each
user
in
the
training
data,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and is thus very computationally cheap.
 
 
Finally,
a
script
is
run
on
Heroku
to
generate
recommendations
from
a
stored
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pickle file, which then returns a list of questions for the user [A2].
 
For the design of our website, we used HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, however,
 
this CSS and JavaScript was supported mostly by Bootstrap [7]. Bootstrap is a
 
framework to quickly design and customize responsive websites for any project using
 
CSS, JQuery, and JavaScript. To quickly build our website, we used Bootstrap’s jsDelivr
 
functionality to embed bootstrap into our HTML and develop the design of the website
 
using the classes in the CSS. The design for the CSS that we used came from
 
Bootswatch [8]. Bootswatch has many design templates available to use, but the one
 
used for this was the Lux theme made by Thomas Park [9]. By using Bootstrap, we
 
were able to convert our HTML layout into a specific simple design with clickable links to
 
Super User questions, a navigation bar, a contact form, a scrollable window inside a
 
form to submit cold start questions that a user might be able to handle. Bootstrap makes
 
it easy to turn the tags that were already made in our HTML document into specific
 
designs that are adjustable to what is needed for the website using their class names.
 
 
 
  
Next Steps/Future Plans/Possible Future
 
There
are
many
potential
avenues
we
can
take
ForumRec
as
a
recommendation
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
system
and
product
in
future
steps.
One
potential
update
would
be
to
make
the
update
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
period
for
the
model
smaller.
Instead
of
the
model
being
updated
every
3
days,
we
can
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
work
to
make
the
model
update
every
day
or
potentially
multiple
times
a
day,
so
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
whenever
users
login
to
get
their
recommendations
they
can
have
models
that
better
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reflect
the
changes
that
are
being
made
to
Super
User
continuously.
This
would
allow
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
users
to
get
fresher
recommendations
and
may
encourage
them
to
look
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommendations more frequently or interact with Super User more.
 
Another
potential
update
would
be
to
get
user
feedback.
As
a
product,
we
want
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ForumRec
to
be
helping
our
user
base
and
creating
recommendations
for
them
that
are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
relevant
to
their
expertise
and
also
encourages
them
to
engage
with
the
Super
User
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
forum.
By
utilizing
user
feedback
we
can
see
how
ForumRec
is
able
to
help
users,
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
what
potential
changes
would
be
needed
to
our
model
or
our
predictions
in
order
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
encourage users to use our platform and answer more questions on the forum site.
 
A
lot
of
the
work
we
are
doing
also
focuses
on
newer
users
who
have
less
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
experience
using
Super
User
and
have
not
answered
many
questions,
however,
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
also
want
to
focus
on
more
veteran
users
who
answer
questions
on
Super
User
more
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
often.
They
make
up
a
large
portion
of
Super
User’s
questions
and
answers
and
can
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have
a
larger
impact
on
how
ForumRec
can
impact
Super
User.
We
want
to
be
able
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
provide
them
with
recommendations
that
can
help
ease
their
experience
with
the
forum
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
allow
them
to
check
our
recommendations
and
quickly
determine
the
questions
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
best
for
them.
We
hope
by
focusing
on
more
experienced
users,
we
can
also
improve
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
efficiency
of
the
forum
site
and
allow
less
questions
to
remain
unanswered
on
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
website as we help veteran users be more efficient in their use of Super User.
 
 
 
 
 
  
Conclusion
 
Through
a
forum
based
recommendation
system,
we
believe
that
we
can
provide
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
users
with
an
easier
experience
in
engaging
with
forums
like
Super
User.
Through
our
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommender
system,
we
want
to
be
able
to
determine
the
best
users
to
answer
certain
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
questions
when
a
question
is
asked
on
the
forum,
and
then
send
those
users
those
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
questions
to
help
them
engage
with
the
platform.
Through
the
hybrid
collaborative
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
content-based
filtering
model
we
have
established
with
the
posts
and
the
users,
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
attempt
to
make
that
exchange,
with
results
that
are
clearly
better
than
the
baseline
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommendations.
However,
there
is
a
lot
we
can
do
to
improve
the
model
and
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
precision,
recall,
and
AUC
scores
we
get
from
it.
This
is
something
we
plan
to
improve
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
work
on
to
ensure
an
effective
recommendation
system
and
will

ABSTRACT
 
Recommendations
for
outdoor
rock
 
 
 
 
climbing
has
historically
been
limited
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
word
of
mouth,
guide
books,
and
most
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
popular
climbs.
With
our
project
OnSight,
 
 
 
 
 
 
we
believe
we
can
offer
personalized
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommendations for outdoor rock climbers.
 
INTRODUCTION
 
Recently,
rock
climbing
has
grown
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
popularity.
Most
of
the
growth
has
been
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
indoor
gym
climbing,
while
outdoor
 
 
 
 
 
climbing
hasn’t
experienced
the
same
 
 
 
 
 
growth.
We
think
the
reason
for
the
lack
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
growth
in
outdoor
climbing
is
related
to
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lack
of
good
recommendations.
Currently,
 
 
 
 
 
there
is
no
established
way
of
getting
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommended
personalized
climbs.
The
 
 
 
 
traditional
ways
would
be
through
word
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mouth,
guide
books,
or
websites
like
 
 
 
 
 
 
MountainProject.com.
However,
each
of
 
 
 
 
these options have drawbacks.
 
 
For
word
of
mouth,
it
requires
you
to
have
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
contact
with
knowledgeable
outdoor
 
 
 
 
climbers,
which
many
indoor
climbers
do
 
 
 
 
 
 
not
have.
Additionally,
knowledgeable
 
 
 
 
outdoor
climbers
can
only
have
complete
 
 
 
 
 
 
knowledge
of
one
or
two
areas,
so
cross
area
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommendations are impossible.
 
 
In
the
case
of
guide
books,
the
only
form
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommendation
they
offer
are
the
author’s
 
 
 
 
 
 
ratings
for
the
climb.
Obviously
there
is
no
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
way to tailor a guide book for an individual.
 
 
 
Furthermore,
guide
books
are
very
rarely
 
 
 
 
 
 
free,
and
only
cover
one
climbing
area,
so
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that
cross
climbing
area
recommendations
 
 
 
 
 
are impossible.
 
 
The
final
place
to
get
outdoor
climbing
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommendations
are
online
websites,
such
 
 
 
 
 
as
Mountain
Project.
Similar
to
guide
books,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
these
websites
only
offer
the
most
popular
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
climbs
based
on
the
community's
ratings.
On
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
no
website
is
there
any
way
to
get
tailored
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommendations,
even
though
the
internet
 
 
 
 
 
is the perfect medium.
 
 
These
downsides
are
a
large
part
of
our
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
motivation
to
create
a
better
outdoor
rock
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
climbing recommender.
 
 
By
creating
a
recommender
system
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
outdoor
rock
climbing
routes,
we
would
 
 
 
 
 
 
help
grow
the
outdoor
climbing
scene
by
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
letting
current
indoor
climbers
transition
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
outdoor
climbing.
It
would
also
improve
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
experience
for
outdoor
climbers
by
allowing
 
 
 
 
 
 
them
to
find
good
and
relevant
climbing
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
routes.
 
DATA ACQUISITION
 
Data
for
this
recommender
system
came
 
 
 
 
 
 
from
MountainProject.com.
Mountain
 
 
 
Project
is
a
site
where
users
can
submit
data
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
about
climbing
routes
they
found
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
subsequent
users
can
rate
those
routes.
We
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
chose
Mountain
Project
because
it
has
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
large
catalog
of
climbs
located
in
the
United
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 States
and
comprehensive
data
about
 
 
 
 
 
climbing routes.
 
 
Mountain
Project
contains
data
on
all
types
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
rock
climbs:
boulder,
route,
aid,
ice,
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mixed.
Of
these
five
types
of
climbs,
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
only
scraped
data
for
boulder
and
route
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
climbs
due
to
limitations
in
our
data
storage
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
memory
limits.
Boulders
are
climbs
 
 
 
 
 
 
done
without
a
rope,
and
can
range
from
less
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
than
10
feet
to
50
feet
(where
serious
injury
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or
death
may
occur).
Boulder
difficulty
 
 
 
 
 
 
starts
at
V0
at
the
easiest,
and
goes
to
V16
at
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
hardset.
Routes
are
climbs
done
with
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rope,
and
can
range
from
20
feet
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
multi-pitch
climbs
thousands
of
feet
long.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Route
difficulty
goes
from
5.0
to
5.9,
then
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
goes
5.10a,
5.10b,
5.10c,
5.10d,
then
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.11a-5.11d, all the way to 5.15d.
 
 
Even
though
much
of
Mountain
Project’s
 
 
 
 
 
 
database
is
user
submitted,
the
verification
 
 
 
 
 
 
system
on
the
website
gives
us
high
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
confidence
that
every
climb
on
the
website
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
actually exists.
 
 
Although
Mountain
Project
did
have
a
data
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
API,
it
was
deprecated
right
before
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
started
working
on
OnSight.
As
a
result,
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
obtained
data
from
Mountain
Project
by
 
 
 
 
 
 
scraping
their
website.
From
this
scraping,
 
 
 
 
 
 
we
obtained
data
for
every
route
and
boulder
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in
the
United
States.
For
every
route
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
boulder,
we
obtained
a
unique
climb
 
 
 
 
 
 
identifier,
the
difficulty
of
the
climb,
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
average
rating
and
number
of
ratings,
 
 
 
 
 
 
latitude/longitude
of
the
climb,
number
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
pitches,
height
of
the
climb,
and
the
climb
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
description.
 
 
Specifically,
scraping
was
done
using
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
Beautiful
Soup
python
library.
The
script
 
 
 
 
 
 
started
at
the
state
level,
and
did
a
depth-first
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
search
through
the
various
nested
climbing
 
 
 
 
 
 
areas,
until
climbs
were
found.
For
example,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a tree could look like:
 
 
This
generated
a
list
of
climb
urls
which
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were
then
used
to
scrape
data
for
each
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
climb.
Then,
raw
data
was
cleaned
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
uploaded to MongoDB.
 
 
Data
cleaning
was
a
relatively
simple
 
 
 
 
 
 
process.
First
we
turned
the
difficulty
strings
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for
boulders
and
routes
into
integers.
Then
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
we
did
data
imputation
on
climbs
that
were
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
missing
difficulty
or
height
by
filling
in
with
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-1.
Finally
various
string
data
such
as
climb
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
description
was
cleaned
to
remove
 
 
 
 
 
extraneous
new
lines,
spaces,
and
odd
 
 
 
 
 
 
characters.
 
 
Generally,
we
don’t
recommend
running
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
scraping,
cleaning,
and
uploading
scripts
 
 
 
 
 
since
they
take
a
very
long
time.
For
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
example,
in
the
scraping
tree
above,
 
 
 
 
 
 
California
has
35,137
climbs.
Scraping
all
 
 
 
 
 
 
those
climbs
took
about
one
full
day.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Because
the
cleaned
data
is
hosted
on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 MongoDB,
we
recommend
just
querying
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
data.
 
 
There
is
also
a
script
to
scrape
user
profiles,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
specifically
a
user’s
past
climbs.
Whenever
 
 
 
 
 
 
a
user
wants
personalized
recommendations,
 
 
 
 
 
they
will
input
their
Mountain
Project
 
 
 
 
 
 
profile
page.
Their
past
climbing
history,
or
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
‘ticks’,
will
be
used
to
recommend
a
set
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
similar
climbs
based
on
how
the
user
rated
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
each climb.
 
CREATING THE PRODUCT
 
Our
web
application
was
created
full-stack
 
 
 
 
 
 
using
Django.
The
frontend
portion
are
 
 
 
 
 
 
Django
templates
with
the
layout
 
 
 
 
 
determined by Bootstrap 4’s grid system.
 
 
 
Our
data
is
hosted
separately
with
 
 
 
 
 
 
MongoDB.
MongoDB
allows
for
free
data
 
 
 
 
 
 
storage
and
has
a
simple
interface
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reading
and
writing
data.
Their
free
data
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
storage
limit
of
512MB
was
more
than
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enough
for
this
project,
provided
that
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
only scraped boulders and routes.
 
 
 
We
are
currently
using
Heroku's
free
tier
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
host
our
web
application.
Heroku
allows
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
easy
web
hosting
and
simple
debugging.
 
 
 
 
 
 
However,
it’s
free
tier
only
allows
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
512MB
of
memory
across
all
users
using
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
website,
so
there
can
be
issues
when
large
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
numbers
of
people
are
trying
to
use
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
website
at
once.
Additionally,
Heroku
has
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
default
website
request
timeout
of
30
 
 
 
 
 
 
seconds,
which
limits
the
complexity
of
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommendation algorithms we use.
 
THE RECOMMENDER
 
Our
recommender
system
is
delivered
as
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
web
application.
You
can
check
out
our
site
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
at
​
https://dsc180b-rc-rec.herokuapp.com/
​
.
 
 
On
the
site,
you
will
be
asked
to
input
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
number
of
output
recommendations,
the
 
 
 
 
 
target
location,
the
maximum
range
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
search
for
in
miles,
the
climbing
difficulty,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
climbing
type,
and
the
algorithm
of
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommender.
 
 
After
inputting
your
preferences,
the
site
 
 
 
 
 
 
will
output
the
number
of
recommendations
 
 
 
 
 
 
that
satisfy
your
specifications.
Each
output
 
 
 
 
 
 
will
consist
of
the
climbing
route’s
name,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
corresponding
Mountain
Project
URL,
 
 
 
 
 
the
difficulty
grade,
and
the
description
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the climb (limited to about 600 characters).
 
 
The
application
uses
the
Google
Maps
API
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
specify
location
input.
Users
have
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
option
to
input
a
location
by
searching
for
it
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in
the
search
bar,
by
typing
in
latitude
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
longitude
coordinates,
or
by
dragging
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
map
interface
to
the
target
location
(the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
center
of
the
map
will
be
the
target
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
location).
 
 
 
The
maximum
distance
field
allows
users
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
restrict
location
of
the
recommended
climbs.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Only
climbs
within
the
specified
radius
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
specified
location
will
be
recommended.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Users
can
search
within
a
small
radius
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
around
the
target
area
or
expand
the
search
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
further away.
 
 
 
The
difficulty
range
input
lets
users
restrict
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
their
search
to
only
routes
with
difficulties
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
users
are
interested
in.
There
are
two
inputs
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for
difficulty:
rock
climbing
routes
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
bouldering
routes.
Each
of
the
two
inputs
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
follow
different
rating
systems.
If
users
are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
unfamiliar
with
the
rating
systems
of
each
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
style
of
climb,
an
article
written
by
REI
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
provided
for
reference.
If
users
are
only
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
interested
in
rock
climbing
or
bouldering
 
 
 
 
 
 
routes,
they
can
specify
to
only
receive
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
certain
styles
of
climbs
by
checking
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
unchecking
the
styles
(ie
Boulder
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
Route).
The
climbs
with
unchecked
styles
 
 
 
 
 
 
will
be
ignored
when
producing
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommendations.
 
 
The
website
currently
has
two
implemented
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommender
systems.
A
non-personalized
 
 
 
 
recommender
which
recommends
the
most
 
 
 
 
 
popular
highly
rated
climbs
at
the
target
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
area,
and
a
personalized
recommender
 
 
 
 
 
which
recommends
climbs
similar
to
those
 
 
 
 
 
 
the user has enjoyed in the past.
 
 
 
Additionally,
for
personalized
 
 
 
recommendations,
users
will
be
asked
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
input
their
Mountain
Project
user
profile
url
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in
order
to
find
their
most
liked
climbs,
as
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
determined
by
their
highest
rated.
If
users
do
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
not
have
a
Mountain
Project
account,
or
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have
not
given
any
ratings,
they
are
unable
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to get personalized recommendations.
 
 
Users
that
are
new
to
outdoor
climbing
will
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have
to
use

TOP
POPULAR
 
 
RECOMMENDER
 
Both
the
top
popular
and
personalized
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommenders
first
filter
the
entire
database
 
 
 
 
 
 
based
on
certain
user
input
parameters
like
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
difficulty
level,
location,
and
style
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
climbing.
 
 
The
maximum
distance
input
is
special
 
 
 
 
 
 
because
part
of
it
happens
before
querying
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
any
data.
Before
we
apply
most
of
the
user
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
input
filterings,
what
we
query
from
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
database
is
dependent
on
the
maximum
 
 
 
 
 
 
range
input.
This
is
absolutely
necessary
so
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that
we
do
not
have
to
download
the
entire
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
database
to
the
website,
nor
hold
the
entire
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
database
in
memory.
To
do
this,
we
create
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
latitude/longitude
approximation
square,
and
 
 
 
 
query
the
database
for
climbs
inside
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
square.
Typically,
this
cuts
down
on
climbs
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from
the
hundreds
of
thousands
to
just
a
few
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
thousand or even a few hundred.
 
 
The
distance
filter
is
then
finished
by
using
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
highly
accurate
Haversine
formula.
 
 
 
 
 
Climbs
located
beyond
the
maximum
 
 
 
 
 
distance are removed from consideration.
 
 Next,
climbs
are
filtered
by
the
type
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
climbs
requested
(boulder
and/or
route),
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
then by the difficulty of climbs requested.
 
 
Finally,
the
top
popular
recommender
has
an
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
additional
filter
where
only
routes
with
an
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
average
rating
of
3.5
out
of
4
or
higher
are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommended.
We
have
this
filter
just
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
case
we
recommend
a
universally
hated
 
 
 
 
 
 
route
even
though
it
has
more
votes
than
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
others.
 
 
In
the
end,
we
rank
the
recommendations
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
based
on
the
number
of
votes
and
only
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
return
the
top
N
ones
based
on
the
user's
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
input of number of recommendations.
 
PERSONALIZED
 
RECOMMENDER
 
The
personalized
recommender
starts
the
 
 
 
 
 
same
as
the
top
popular
recommender
by
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
applying
filters
such
as
maximum
range,
 
 
 
 
 
 
type
of
climb,
and
difficulty
level
to
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
entire database.
 
 
The
recommender
then
takes
the
input
user
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
profile
URL
and
scrapes
it
for
the
user’s
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
favorite
climbs.
We
define
favorite
climbs
 
 
 
 
 
 
as
all
those
climbs
which
have
the
max
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rating
the
user
has
ever
given.
Additionally,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
all
climbs
the
user
has
done
are
all
removed
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from
the
filtered
database
(we
would
not
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
want
to
recommend
a
climb
the
user
has
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
already done!).
 
 
For
each
of
these
identified
favorite
routes
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
all
the
possible
filtered
recommendation
 
 
 
 
 
 
candidates,
we
create
a
cosine
similarity
 
 
 
 
 
 
matrix
with
the
aid
of
Scikit-Learn.
We
then
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
return
the
routes
with
the
highest
cosine
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
similarity
scores.
That
way,
we
are
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommending
routes
that
are
the
most
 
 
 
 
 
 
similar
to
the
user's
favorite
routes,
which
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
potentially can become their favorites too.
 
CONCLUSION
 
 
With
OnSight,
we
aimed
to
contribute
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
outdoor
rock
climbing
by
providing
both
 
 
 
 
 
 
personalized
and
non-personalized
 
 
 
recommendations.
 
 
Even
though
our
non-personalized
 
 
 
 
recommender
is
a
top
popular
recommender,
 
 
 
 
 
 
it
already
goes
beyond
the
functionality
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
Mountain
Project
top
popular
 
 
 
 
 
recommender.
Mountain
Project
limits
 
 
 
 
recommendations
to
climbing
areas,
so
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
example,
you
would
have
to
choose
between
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
California
and
Oregon
climbing
areas,
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
could
not
search
for
climbs
on
the
border.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
OnSight allows for this functionality.
 
 
Our
personalized
recommender
is
a
huge
 
 
 
 
 
 
step
towards
customized
outdoor
rock
 
 
 
 
 
climbing
recommendations.
It
particularly
 
 
 
 
thrives
in
helping
climbers
find
climbs
 
 
 
 
 
 
similar
to
those
they
have
enjoyed
in
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
past.
None
of
the
previous
recommenders
 
 
 
 
 
 
systems
such
as
word

books, or online recommendations have this
 
ability.
 
DISCUSSION
 
In
this
project,
a
major
challenge
we
had
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was
obtaining
the
data.
When
we
initially
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
built
the
prototype
of
our
recommender,
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were
only
basing
off
of
the
data
of
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Yosemite
National
Park
region,
and
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
data
took
about
45
minutes
to
scrape.
We
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were
a
little
skeptical
as
to
whether
it
was
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 possible
to
scrape
data
for
the
entire
United
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
States
with
just
the
three
of
us.
Thankfully,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with
teamwork,
we
were
able
to
coordinate
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
scraping
effort
between
us
three
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
obtained
data
of
the
entire
United
States
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
over about a week of non-stop running.
 
 
With
rock
climbing,
especially
outdoors,
 
 
 
 
 
there
is
an
inherent
risk
that
is
taken
when
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
you
decide
to
climb.
A
boulder
climb
as
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
short
as
a
few
feet
can
cause
injury
with
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bad
landing,
and
rope
climbing
gear
can
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
always
fail.
By
making
rock
climbing
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommendations,
some
users
may
assume
 
 
 
 
 
that
the
climbs
we
recommend
are
safe,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which
can
never
be
the
case
due
to
inherent
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
risk.
We
tried
to
solve
this
issue
by
adding
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disclaimer
to
the
website
that
appears
upon
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
opening for the first time.
 
 
Moving
forwards,
our
future
steps
include
 
 
 
 
 
 
incorporating
more
climbing
types
such
as
 
 
 
 
 
 
ice,
aid,
or
mixed
climbs.
We
will
also
look
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
into
recommending
top
popular
based
on
​
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
highest
rated
recommender,
taking
into
 
 
 
 
 
account
number
of
ratings
with
a
binomial
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
confidence
interval,
such
as
the
Wilson
 
 
 
 
 
 
score interval.
 
 
Once
the
pandemic
lessens
out,
we
will
be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
posting
our
recommender
on
platforms
such
 
 
 
 
 
 
as
Reddit
inviting
interested
people
to
try
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
out
the
recommendations
and
let
us
know
if
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
it is helpful or need further modifications.

 ","The project ""OnSight: Outdoor Rock Climbing Recommendations"" aims to provide personalized recommendations for outdoor rock climbers. Currently, the lack of good recommendations is hindering the growth of outdoor climbing. The traditional methods of word of mouth, guide books, and online websites have limitations. To address this issue, the project uses data from MountainProject.com and implements a recommender system. The system allows users to input their preferences such as location, difficulty level, and climbing type to receive tailored recommendations. The project includes both a top popular recommender and a personalized recommender based on the user's past climbing history. The website also provides information on data acquisition, creating the product, and the challenges faced during the project. Moving forward, the team plans to incorporate more climbing types and improve the recommendation algorithms."

ABSTRACT
Many have probably found themselves in an uncomfortable conver-
sation in which a parent is questioning why the song playing over
a bedroom speaker is so loud, repetitive, or profane. If someone has
never had such a conversation, at the very least they have probably
made a conscious decision to refrain from playing a certain genre
or artist when their parents are around. Knowing what music to
play in these situations does not have to be an elaborate, stressful
process. In fact, finding appropriate songs can be made quite simple
with the help of recommendation systems.
Our solution to this issue actually consists of two recommenda-
tion systems that function in similar ways. The first takes music
that parents enjoy and recommends it to their children. The second
takes music that children enjoy and recommends it to their parents.
Both of these recommendation systems create their own individual
Spotify playlists that try to “bridge the gap” between the music
tastes of parents and their children. Through user testing and user
interviews we found that our recommenders had mixed success
in creating playlists that could be listened to by children and their
parents. The success of our recommendations seemed to be largely
correlated with the degree of inherent similarity between the music
tastes of children and their parents. So while our solution is not
perfect, in situations where overlap between parents and children
exist, our recommender can successfully “bridge the gap”.
1 INTRODUCTION
It is not uncommon for teenagers and young adults to have dis-
agreements with their parents. Usually these points of contention
involve things like chores, curfews, and other byproducts of living
under the same roof. However, these discussions may occasionally
spill over into other areas of life, namely choice of music. Teenagers
can often find themselves in uncomfortable situations where the
songs they play are too loud, unfamiliar, or profane for their parents.
In order to avoid these scenarios, teens must keep a mental record
of what music their parents disapprove of and where this music is
contained in their playlists and music libraries. Some teens might
rather opt for complete silence in the presence of their parents than
keep track of all this information. Finding music to play around
one’s parents does not have to be such a complicated or stressful
process. In fact, this process can be made quite simple with the
help of a recommendation system. To solve the disputes caused by
music between teenagers and their parents, we have developed the
music recommender website, bridgingthegapwithmusic.com. This
web application leverages information from our users, teenagers
and young adults, to quickly recommend music that they can listen
to and enjoy with their parents.
Figure 1: Billboard’s Song Distribution By Year
Our recommendation system is designed to do two main tasks:
recommend parents’ music to users, and recommend users’ music
to parents. Each of these tasks has their own unique algorithm
that generates a final playlist of recommendations on the user’s
Spotify account. Both recommendation algorithms try to find a
rough middle ground between user and parent music tastes. With
this in place, the user is able to quickly and automatically generate
playlists which can be safely listened to and enjoyed in the presence
of their parents.
2 DATASETS
2.1 Billboard
For the sample playlist generation for parent-to-user recommenda-
tions, we use the Billboard Weekly Hot 100 Singles dataset1, which
contains the top 100 songs every week from 1958 to 2019 (Figure 1).
The columns of the dataset include: url, WeekID, Week Position,
Song, Performer, SongID (concatenation of Song and Performer),
Instance (number of times the song has appeared on the chart; each
song starts with 1 and increments every time it disappears and
reappears on the chart), Previous Week Position, Peak Position, and
Weeks on Chart. There are 320,000 rows in the dataset containing
statistics about 28,000 distinct songs. To generate features used
in the recommender, we grouped the data by SongID to get the
average week position, the first week it appeared on Billboard, the
last week it appeared on Billboard, as well as the number of weeks
it has been on the chart.

Figure 2: Last.fm’s User Distribution By Age
2.2 Last.fm
For both parent-user and user-parent recommendation tasks, we
work with two datasets from Last.fm2, a music website based in the
U.K., to get their users’ listening history. The first dataset contains
user profile data for all Last.fm users. After cleaning the dataset
to deal with missing values, there are about 284,000 distinct users
in the dataset with profile information including: UserID, gender,
age, country, and date registered (joined Last.fm). We filter the
dataset based on country to work primarily with recommending
songs to people who live within the United States which reduces
the number of users to around 52,000. For user ages, we could see
that the users skewed younger with the majority between 20 to 40
(Figure 2). The second dataset contains the user listening history
including columns: User ID, Artist ID, Artist Name, and Number of
Plays. There are about 17 million entries in the entire dataset, and
about 2.5 million entries when filtered by users living in the United
States.
2.3 Spotify
Spotify3has a significant amount of information about artists and
their music and we use Spotify’s API to access this information
and integrate it into our existing data. Our primary use of the
Spotify API is to pull user listening information. Unfortunately,
Spotify only allows access to the 50 most recent observations in a
user’s listening history, so instead we scrape a user’s playlists to
understand the different artists that they listen to. This does not
provide as much information about the frequency of certain artists
in a user’s listening history, but considering the alternative it is a
much better source of information.
We also use the API to pull artist objects that contain information
about what genres an artist is defined by, and what other artists
are related to them. We use this information in both of our rec-
ommenders so that we can filter recommended artists by user or
parent genre preferences. The related artist information is used to
broaden our artist recommendations and include artists that are
not present in any of our datasets or the user’s listening history.
2https://www.kaggle.com/neferfufi/lastfm
3https://developer.spotify.com/Spotify also provides sonic information for all of the tracks listed
on their platform in the form of track objects and audio feature
objects. These objects contain features that describe a song in terms
of its key, tempo, acousticness, and so on. These features are mainly
used for some elements inside our parent-to-user recommendations,
but other than that our project does not make much use of them.
The track object also states whether a song is explicit or not which
allows us to filter our recommendations to exclude profanity or
other explicit content.
2.4 User Input
Prior to generating recommendations, we ask our users for some
information regarding their parents. Since we make the assumption
that parents do not have a Spotify account with listening history
that we can leverage, we must ask these questions so we have
some understanding of the parent’s music taste. These questions
are essentially limited to the parent’s age, preferred genres, and a
preferred artist. Parent age is used to approximate the era a parent
grew up in and therefore the music they might have listened to
growing up. The preferred music genres and the preferred artist are
used to help our recommender understand what genres the parent
is interested in, and to filter out any irrelevant recommendations.
3 METHODS
The recommender is split into two parts for different purposes:
(1) parent-to-user recommendations,
(2) user-to-parent recommendations
An optional sample recommender step exists for parents (or users)
who do not have a Spotify account, or do not have enough listening
history for us to work with.
3.1 Sample TopPopular Recommender
For this sample recommender, we use a TopPopular recommender
where we rank the “popularity” of each song in the Billboard dataset
and return the most popular songs (Figure 3). All songs in Billboard
are filtered first by their release dates: we assumed the relevant
timeframe for the parent’s age to be from when they were 15 years
old, to when they were 30 years old based on the premise that an
individual’s music preference is determined around age 15 and that
they stop listening to new songs by the age of 30 [ 6]. The songs
are then filtered by the parent’s preferred genres and artists, and
ordered by their popularity, which is determined by three statistics:
instance, average weekly position, and the number of weeks the
song was on the chart. The songs are ordered by lowest instance,
lowest average weekly position and highest number of weeks to
exclude seasonal songs like Christmas carols with high instance
values, and prioritize songs that were ranked higher on the chart
for longer. The final output contains the top songs that take the
parent’s input into account.
3.2 Parent-User Hybrid (CF+CBF)
Recommender
The parent-to-user recommender uses a hybrid approach, mean-
ing that it uses both collaborative filtering (CF) and content-basedBridging the Gap: Solving Music Disputes with Recommendation Systems
Figure 3: Workflow of Sample Recommender
Figure 4: Workflow of Parent-User Recommender
filtering (CBF) techniques to recommend songs (Figure 4). We de-
cided not to rely solely on CF methods unlike our user-to-parent
recommender, due to the Last.fm dataset having a limited number
of users aged over 40, which is where our parents are more likely
to fit in.
The CF part of this hybrid recommender uses LightFM [ 3], a
Python library using matrix factorization for implicit and explicit
feedback. Using Spotipy [ 4], the Python library for Spotify’s Web
API, we get the parent’s top 50 tracks on Spotify, get the artist for
each track as well as the number of songs each artist had produced
in the 50 songs. The Last.fm data also contains each user’s listening
frequency for each artist, so we use this frequency as the ‘weight’
for each item, meaning that the artist that is more listened to by the
parent would be of more importance. We decided to use LightFM for
the CBF part of this model as it uses latent representation to address
the cold-start problem by grouping items that are liked by the same
users, even if the items do not share similar features. To reduce the
amount of data we work with and to improve the recommender’s
performance, we ask the parent for their user/children’s age and
only get Last.fm data within a similar age range as the user, getting
users that are up to 2 years younger or older than the child user.
Each user-artist interaction in both the parent’s listening history
as well as the Last.fm data is a positive interaction (instead of a
negative interaction, where a user specifies that they did not like
the item) used to build LightFM’s recommender model, which also
stores every user and artist in the interactions. LightFM essentially
works by representing each user and item fed into the model as the
sum of latent representation, and finding the dot product of those
representations using the equation:
𝑟𝑢𝑖=𝑓(𝑞𝑢∗𝑝𝑖+𝑏𝑢+𝑏𝑖) (1)where 𝑞𝑢represents the user’s latent representation (= sum of
latent vectors), 𝑝𝑖represents the item’s latent representation, and
with 𝑏𝑢and𝑏𝑖each representing bias terms for the user and the item
[2]. We chose WARP (Weighted Approximate-Rank Pairwise) for
the loss function as it resulted in a higher AUC than BPR (Bayesian
Personalized Ranking), the only other loss function suitable for
having only positive interactions available as data. For each user
in the model, the artists are ranked by the dot product; we get the
artists with the highest dot product value as an output from this
model.
Although LightFM has CBF functionality, we found out that its
item features implementation does not work properly and could not
be used for CBF. Thus, for the CBF part of this recommender, we
decided to use euclidean distance (instead of a common CBF method
like cosine similarity, suggested by Rethana [ 5]). to calculate the
distance between other songs and the parent’s top tracks, using
their audio features from Spotify. From the LightFM’s output list
of artists (the number of artists is defaulted to 10 for convenience,
since Spotify’s API only allows pulling audio information for up to
100 songs at a time), we get the top 10 popular songs from each artist
and compile a list of 100 songs. Then we calculate the euclidean
distance between those songs and the parent’s preferred songs,
using the formula:
𝑑𝑝𝑞=vut11Õ
𝑖=1(𝑝𝑖−𝑞𝑖)2 (2)
where 𝑝𝑖and 𝑞𝑖are the ithaudio features from arbitrary song
p and parent’s song q, from 11 features: danceability, energy, key,
loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, live-
ness, valence, and tempo. We get the minimum Euclidean distance
for each song in the recommended list from all of the parent’s songs,
and rank the songs by their shortest distance from any parent’s
song. The final output is a list of songs ordered by ascending eu-
clidean distance, to recommend songs that are most similar to the
parent’s preferred songs in terms of audio features to the user.
3.3 User-Parent Collaborative Filtering (CF)
Recommender
With our user-parent recommender (Figure 5), we first request
information from the user about their parent including their age,
favored genres, and favorite artist. To build the user to parent
recommender, we work primarily with the Last.fm data. Since we
want to recommend to parents, we want to build similarity between
the user and the parent so the playlist output would be enjoyed by
both the user and the parent. We do this by extracting the users from
the parents’ age range from the Last.fm user profile dataset (user_id,
age, country, etc). We pull these Last.fm users’ listening history from
the Last.fm listening history dataset (user_id, artist_id, artist_name,
plays) which helps to provide a basis for the recommender. We
then want to pull from the user’s listening history, specifically user
playlist data which we can use to approximate a listening history
similar to the one found in the Last.fm listening history dataset.
We generate a user-artist interaction matrix using the user playlist
data such that it is analogous to the user-artist interaction matrix
created.Duncan Carlmark, Sarat Sreepathy, and Nayoung Park
Figure 5: Workflow of User-Parent Recommender
After gathering the user’s listening history, we can use the user’s
listening history to find similarities between the user and the users
from the parents’ age range in the Last.fm dataset. We also want
to normalize the plays (frequency) column for the listening his-
tory so we have a common scale and there are less concerns about
bias. We then move to create categories (assign numbers) for each
unique user and artist in the dataset to clean the data and also
transform the dataset so we can build the user-item interaction and
item-user interaction matrix. The user-item interaction matrix has
shape [num_user∗num_items] and the item-user matrix has shape
[num_item∗num_user]. We implement this data transformation
such that the [ith, jth] entry of a user-item interaction matrix is the
rating of the ith user for the jth item and that is similarly applied to
the item-user interaction matrix. We then combine both the Last.fm
user-artist interaction matrix with the user-artist interaction ma-
trix generated with the user’s playlist data to have a user-artist
interaction matrix ready for the collaborative filtering model.
We then use Implicit [ 1,2] using alternating least squares to
build similarity between the user’s playlist and older users (users
in the parent’s age range) in the LastFM dataset. For our implicit
feedback model, we use plays as our “rating.” Once we fit the model,
we can now build recommendations for the particular user, in this
case the user who has requested a playlist for their parent, and
a list of recommended artists is returned. In our initial responses
collected by the user, we collected the parent’s favored genres so
we use that data to filter down the recommended artists. We use
Spotipy [ 4] to collect the genre for each artist and we then filter
the list of recommended artists down to artists that are represented
by the favored genre of the parent. We can then use Spotify’s top
tracks to build a playlist from these filtered recommended artists to
get a final list of songs that is outputted to a playlist on the user’s
Spotify account.
4 RESULTS
For the parent-user recommender, we evaluated LightFM, the CF
part of the recommender, using AUC and NDCG. AUC, or Area
Under the Curve, refers to the probability that a classifier will
rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly
chosen negative one . Generally speaking, a higher area under
the curve means a more effective recommendation system. The
LightFM model resulted in a training AUC of 0.988, and test AUC of
0.618 (Table 1). NDCG, or Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain,
is a measure of ranking the quality of a recommender system by the
difference in actual rankings and predicted rankings. Unfortunately,we were unable to evaluate the entire hybrid recommender as the
CBF part recommends songs instead of artists like the CF part does,
but evaluating the CBF method using a sample user’s top 10 songs
resulted in an NDCG of 0.80.
When evaluating the user-parent recommender, we relied on
both offline testing as well as user feedback studies. For offline test-
ing, we used the metric AUC or area under the curve to evaluate
the recommender. When evaluating the implicit feedback recom-
mender, we found that the AUC would average around 0.8-0.82
which suggested that it was generally effective (Table 1).
Table 1: Performance of Our Recommenders
Recommender Training/Test AUC NDCG@10
Parent-User CF 0.988/0.618
Parent-User CBF 0.80
User-Parent CF /0.8-0.82
To broaden our understanding beyond metrics we conducted
user studies where we collected feedback from users about their
experiences with our both recommenders. What we found was
that the effectiveness of our recommendations was closely tied
to the inherent similarity between users and their parents music
preferences. When there was significant overlap in genre preference,
both users and parents enjoyed the playlists they received. However,
as the differences between parents and their children increased the
enjoyment of our recommendations also somewhat decreased. The
drop in enjoyment was especially noticeable when there was a
complete difference in music preferences between the two parties.
Our best example of this is an instance where the user’s parents
listened to singer/songwriter artists, but the user only listened to
EDM and other genres of rave music. Since there was such a drastic
difference in the genres and artists our recommender failed to find
any commonalities or slight mutual interests. In these situations
the recommender leans towards the interests of the parents, so at
the very least the user can listen to the playlist around their parents
even though they might not enjoy the music that was recommended.
This means that at its worst, our recommender can accomplish our
goal of giving users something to put on around their parents, but
it cannot fulfill the goal of having both parties enjoy what is being
played.
5 CONCLUSION
When first approaching the problem of music recommendations, we
wanted to address disparities in music taste. We could see instances
in our own lives where disparities in music taste might lead to
conflict, especially with our own parents. This realization served
as our motivation for developing bridgingthegapwithmusic.com,
since automated recommendations could simplify the process of
finding music for both younger and older audiences to enjoy. In
our recommender, we attempt to solve this problem through two
approaches: recommending music from 1) parents to users and 2)
from users to parents.
(1)In our first approach, we find songs that parents would enjoy
and recommend similar songs to their children. We do thisBridging the Gap: Solving Music Disputes with Recommendation Systems
using Billboard rankings as well as parent Spotify history
to generate a basis for what we expect parents to enjoy. We
then request data about the children, like their favorite genre,
to build similarity between the parent’s songs and the user’s
music taste.
(2)In our second approach, we find songs that children en-
joy and recommend similar songs to parents. We use the
children’s Spotify listening history and request information
from the parent, like their age, to build similarity and offer
recommendations.
When evaluating our recommenders with user feedback, we
found that our algorithms performed well when there was some
degree of overlap between users and their parents. As that overlap
begins to disappear the enjoyment of our recommendations tends to
decrease. Whenever the differences between a user and their parent
become so extreme that there is little to no overlap, or algorithms
struggle to produce recommendations that can be enjoyed by both
parties. In general our recommender can consistently generate
music that can be played around one’s parents. Whether or not
children and their parents can enjoy this music together largely
depends on the overlap between their music preferences.
In the future, our project could be expanded to include more
comprehensive features rather than relying principally on collabo-
rative filtering techniques. One potential pathway forward could
be to emphasize sonic characteristics more. We include these char-
acteristics partially in our parent-user hybrid model, but we do not
use them anywhere else in this project. Using these characteristics
might help to lessen the impact of inherent genre preference differ-
ences by looking for more abstract and unnoticeable similarities
between the music preferences of children and their parents. An
entirely different way forward could be to look at the situation
from a different perspective entirely and try to nudge the music
preferences of children and their parents together closer over time.
This could function in a way where both parties are given new
playlists every week that slowly come closer together in genre or
sonic characteristics, literally bridging the gap between parents and
children over time. Regardless of what is done next, it is clear that
there is an abundance of potential improvements that have yet to
be tested or explored in our niche of music recommendations.
6 USER INTERFACE
The UI for bridgingthegapwithmusic.com is relatively simple. The
homepage has a short mission statement followed up by a brief
description of our recommendation algorithms. Links to each of our
recommendation algorithms sit at the bottom of the page. There
are other tabs in the navigation bar at the top of the page that link
to more information about the project (Figure 6).
When a user clicks on one of the recommendation algorithms
they are taken to a short form. This is where we ask the users for
the limited amount of parent information that our algorithms need.
Once the users submit their information, they are taken to another
page where they wait for their playlist to be generated (Figure 7).
Once the algorithms are finished generating recommended songs,
they are added to a playlist created on the user’s Spotify account.
The playlist is named after the corresponding algorithm that was

Asnapp - Workout Video Recommender

Project Description
 
For those who work out at home, finding a good workout routine is difficult. It is hard to
 
constantly have to find workout videos that meet your fitness needs, as well as your time and
 
equipment constraints. Plus, the pre-set workouts found online are not one-size-fits-all. In
 
other words, while there are many workout videos online to choose from, these choices are
 
non-personalized. Our project, Asnapp, is a solution that can solve all these problems, as well
 
as meet the growing need for an easy way to build a good at-home workout routine during the
 
pandemic.
 
 
Asnapp is a web application that provides personalized recommendations of workout videos by
 
Fitness Blender
​
1
​
. Our website displays several lists of recommendations (similar to Netflixʼs
 
user interface), such as “top upper body workouts for you”. Users can login into our website,
 
choose between several models to generate their recommendations, browse through
 
personalized recommendations lists, and choose a workout to do, saving them the time and
 
effort needed to build a good workout routine.
 
Report Overview
 
From Fitness Blenderʼs website, we scrape workout related data from all of their free workouts,
 
as well as the Fitness Blender usersʼ comments on each of their workout webpages. We use the
 
comments data to avoid the cold start problem, as it serves as a proxy for user-item interactions
 
needed to train the models with. Thus, we would be able to train models even before building
 
our web application and deploying to users. We further describe the data collection and
 
preprocessing steps in the Data section.
 
We then perform offline testing and evaluate three recommendation models (random, top
 
popular, and a pure collaborative filtering model by LightFM
​
2
​
). The models are trained with
 
the user-item interaction information from the comments data and evaluated on the NDCG
 
metric (normalized discounted cumulative gain). We describe our model implementations and
 
their performance results in the Models section.
 
Finally, we built a web application, where users can login and view their workout video
 
recommendations. The application is connected to a database that collects our usersʼ
 
preferences and workout history information. The database has our previously scraped
 
workout video and comments data uploaded to it as well. The three models we previously
 
evaluated are deployed, and users are able to choose which model to get recommendations
 
from. Since we do not expect to have enough user-item interactions data from our own users,
 
we train the models on both the scraped comments data and the interactions data from Asnapp

users in order to generate our predictions. The recommended workout videos displayed will be
 
only those that match the workout preferences that the user initially inputted, providing
 
further personalization. We describe the details and implementation of our web application in
 
the Web Application section.
 
 
In the Conclusion section, we summarize Asnappʼs value as well as discuss drawbacks and
 
potential improvements.
 
Data
​
3
 
Data Source:
​
 We choose Fitness Blender as our data source, as they have 580 free workout
 
videos on their website and a large user base (6 million subscribers on Youtube). This means
 
there will be a sufficient amount of workout videos to recommend and enough user-item
 
interactions data to train our models with. Fitness Blenderʼs website contains a separate
 
webpage for each of their workouts, with details on that specific workout, such as the duration,
 
calorie burn, difficulty, required equipment, training type, and body focus. These webpages
 
also contain an embedded youtube video and comments from their users (see Appendix A for
 
screenshots of a workoutʼs webpage on Fitness Blender).
 
 
Workout Details:
​
 We implement a scraping script that collects details for every free workout
 
on Fitness Blender. We then clean and preprocess the data, including getting rid of special
 
characters in strings, applying type conversions for strings meant to be numerical values, and
 
performing one hot encoding of the 
​
equipment
​
, 
​
body_focus
​
, and 
​
training_type
​
 columns. The
 
workout video attribute details are then written to the data files 
​
fbworkouts_clean.csv 
​
and
 
fbworkouts_meta.csv 
​
(see Table 1 and 2 in Appendix B for all column names and descriptions).
 
 
Youtube Data:
​
 Furthermore, with the youtube video ids (interpreted from the youtube links we
 
scraped), we then query the Youtube API to gather the workout titles, date posted, and number
 
of likes, shares, and comments for each workoutʼs Youtube video. The data is written to
 
workouts_yt.csv
​
.
 
 
Comments Data: 
​
We also scrape the comments section on each Fitness Blender workout
 
webpage. For each comment, we gather the username and profile picture (if the user has a
 
profile picture, this value is a link, otherwise it is a single letter) of the person commenting as
 
well as the time the comment was posted. During the scraping process, the username and
 
profile picture is combined to create a 
​
hashed_id
​
. During preprocessing, we create our own
 
user_id 
​
(integer value) based on the 
​
hashed_id
​
. We also drop duplicates such that Fitness
 
Blender users who commented on the same workout multiple times will not have that
 
user-item pairing show up more than once in the dataset. We also omit any user who has less
 
than 5
​
4
​
 interactions (commented on less than 5 videos). The final data file that is outputted,
 
user_item_interactions.csv
​
, contains user-item pairings with columns 
​
user_id
​
 and 
​
workout_id
​
.
 
 
3
 See our basic exploratory data analysis of the data 
​
here
 
4
 
​
There is a parameter 
​
d
​
 in our preprocessing function to choose the minimum number of interactions
 
needed to keep the user in the dataset. When d=5, there are 52073 total interactions from 4026 users with
 
580 workout videos.
 
  
Model Input:
​
 For performing offline testing on the user-item interactions data inferred by
 
Fitness Blenderʼs commenters, we first perform a random 70%-30% split on the data to get
 
training and testing datasets. We use LightFMʼs Dataset class to generate the LightFM modelʼs
 
inputs, which are user-item interaction matrices.
 
Models
 
We implement three models as described below:
 
Random
​
: This recommends workouts randomly. For each workout, we randomly assign a
 
score between 0 and 1.
 
Top Popular
​
5
​
: This recommends the most popular workouts based on the number of
 
comments on a workoutʼs Fitness Blender webpage. The score assigned to each prediction is
 
the number of comments.
 
LightFM
​
: This is LightFMʼs pure model, which is a traditional collaborative filtering
​
6
​
 matrix
 
factorization method.
 
 
 
We evaluate these models on the NDCG metric (normalized discounted cumulative gain) using
 
scikit-learnʼs implementation. NDCG is frequently used to measure the relevance and ordering
 
of ranking tasks. It is an appropriate metric to use because our objective is to recommend the
 
most relevant workouts to a user and thus the ordering of our predictions matter.
 
We train the models on the training user-item interaction data (users with less than 5
 
interactions are dropped) and evaluate NDCG (with only the top 20 scores
​
7
​
 considered) on the
 
testing data
​
8
​
. We note that for evaluating these models, we use LightFMʼs method of creating
 
the testing user-item interactions matrix as the true label input of the evaluation function
 
(
​
y_true
​
 in scikit-learnʼs 
​
ndcg_score
​
). Since LightFM uses their internal indices to identify a
 
workout (these differ from the workout ids outputted by our top popular recommender), for
 
evaluating top popular, we also add a mapping function that maps the workouts ids predicted
 
by the model to LightFMʼs internal indices. The results are displayed in Table 1 below.
 
Table 1: Model Results

 We also implement an extension of top popular that includes the data from the Youtube API, but find
 
that it performs worse (see our notebook 
​
here
​
)

Although the top popular model and LightFMʼs pure collaborative filtering model both perform
 
better than the random recommender (which is as expected), the top popular model and
 
LightFMʼs model perform approximately the same. This is surprising as we expect
 
collaborative filtering to perform better than a top popular recommender, since the top
 
popular recommender is non-personalized. We believe this is a result of a vastly sparse dataset.
 
We also note that we attempted to use the vanilla collaborative filtering algorithm and KNN
​
9
​
,
 
which scored roughly the same as random guessing and is consequently not included. This
 
outcome informed us about the possible sparsity of interactions in the data, and the above
 
results further reaffirm it.
 
 
Despite these results, we still choose to deploy all three of these models. Although the random
 
recommender has poor performance with NDCG, we believe that it provides users with the
 
option to diversify their workout routine. Also, even though the top popular recommender is
 
non personalized, we believe that people are naturally drawn to trying what is popular. We
 
note that Netflixʼs recommendation system also has a top popular recommendation, so is it not
 
unreasonable to assume that the top popular model will perform well with our users online.
 
With LightFMʼs collaborative filtering algorithm, we believe it is possible that with the addition
 
of user-item interaction data coming from our own users, the model will perform better.
 
 
Web Application
 
We built a web application which allows users to create an account, login, choose a
 
recommendation model, view their recommendations, and like/dislike workouts theyʼve
 
completed. The back-end is developed using Flask and the front-end with HTML, CSS, and
 
Bootstrap. The application is connected to a MySQL database using Amazon RDS and is
 
deployed with Heroku. The Fitness Blender workouts and comments data collected, as
 
described in the Data section, are all uploaded to the database (see Tables 2, 4-5 in Appendix C).
 
Login/Registration: 
​
When users come to our website, they can either login as an existing user
 
or register themselves as a new user (see Screenshot 1 in Appendix D). During registration, the
 
user is asked for their name, email, password, available equipment, as well as their preferred
 
training types, minimum and maximum calories burned, and duration of workouts (see
 
Screenshot 2 in Appendix D). The registration form has validators to ensure that no fields are
 
not filled out, the password and confirm password fields match, and the ranges for calories and
 
duration are reasonable. After registering, the userʼs information is inserted into the users
 
table in the database, with their password hashed to ensure privacy (see Table 1 in Appendix C
 
for user table column information). On the login page, users fill out email and passwords, and
 
the form validates whether the email exists in the database and that the password matches.
 
Aftering logging in, the userʼs id is recorded as session data, so that users are still logged in
 
even when revisiting the website (assuming they do not log out).
 
Model Deployment: 
​
Once logged in, users are redirected to the recommendation page, where
 
they are able to choose which model to generate their recommendations with (see Screenshot 3
 
in Appendix D). The three models we previously evaluated are deployed (displayed to the user
 
as “Random”, “Most Popular”, and “Recommended for you”), using SQL statements for the
 
9
 Our implementation of the KNN collaborative filtering approach can be found 
​
here
 
  
random and top popular recommenders and our previously implemented python function for
 
the LightFM model. Similarly to before, since the predictions of LightFM use their internal
 
indices to identify workouts and users, we also add mapping functions that maps LightFMʼs
 
internal item and user indices to the workout and user ids in our data in order to display the
 
corresponding workouts for the appropriate user. Both the top popular and LightFM models
 
are given the combined user-item interactions data inferred from scraped comments on
 
FitnessBlender and interactions recorded from our users on our website as the input to the
 
models.
 
 
Recommendations: 
​
After choosing a recommender, users click a button to view their
 
recommendations (see Screenshot 4 in Appendix D). The recommenderʼs predicted workouts
 
are filtered to keep only ones that match the userʼs preferences specified during the
 
registration process. Specifically, the only workouts kept are the ones that have either no
 
equipment listed or lists equipment that the user has. Similarly, only workouts that match the
 
userʼs preferred training types and are within their preferred difficulty range and workout
 
duration are kept. For calorie burn, if there is some overlap between the userʼs preferred range
 
and the workoutʼs estimated range, then the workout is kept. The filtered recommendations
 
are displayed in four lists for the categories upper body, lower body, core, and total body. Each
 
list shows the top nine ranked workout videos in the respective category (36 recommendations
 
total). Users can click onto a specific workout, which displays a popup to start the workoutʼs
 
Youtube video. Inside the popup, users can skip to the next video in the lists and have the
 
option to like or dislike the workout (see Screenshot 5 in Appendix D). We also allow users to
 
change the display of workouts, such as only including certain body focuses and choosing how
 
many workouts to show on the screen (see Screenshot 6 in Appendix D).
 
Collecting user interactions
​
: If the user clicks on the like button in the popup, this
 
information is recorded into the 
​
user_item_interaction
​
 table (Table 2 in Appendix C). We note
 
that we only consider clicking the like button as an interaction to be added into the table. Thus,
 
users need to click like on at least one workout in order for our LightFM model to be
 
executed
​
10
​
. If a user has no previous interactions and choses the “Recommended for you”
 
option, we default to using a random recommender. If the user clicks on the dislike button, this
 
is added into a table in our database as well (Table 3 in Appendix C). We also filter out workout
 
recommendations that a user has disliked.
 
 
Updating Preferences and Interaction History: 
​
Users can also update their preferences with
 
the “Update Preferences” feature (see Screenshot 7 in Appendix D). This takes users to a form
 
similar to the original registration page, but it is prefilled to include their current workout
 
preferences. When submitted, the userʼs information in the database is updated. Furthermore,
 
the “Workout History” feature (see Screenshot 8 in Appendix D) takes users into a page that is
 
similar to the recommendation page but has the option for users to view their previously liked
 
and disliked workouts. This is particularly useful for users who may want to redo a workout
 
they previously liked or un-dislike a workout they have previously disliked.
 
 
10
 The LightFM model is trained on the 
​
user_item_interaction
​
 table, so the user must first exist in that
 
table in order to get the userʼs predictions.
 
  
Next Steps/Conclusion
 
We acknowledge there is uncertainty as to whether the NDCG performance of the models
 
during offline testing (with only data from the Fitness Blender comments), will be similar to
 
the performance of our deployed recommendation system (which uses the addition of Asnapp
 
usersʼ data). If the user behavior of the Fitness blender comments matches the behavior of
 
Asnapp users, we would expect similar results. However, this would be a strong assumption, so
 
it is possible that if Asnapp were to gain more users, we would see certain models either
 
perform better or worse than seen in offline testing. We would then need to further adjust our
 
chosen models accordingly.
 
 
Another potential future improvement to Asnapp would be to add more recommender options
 
for users. For example, we could add a content based recommender that recommends
 
workouts that are similar to the userʼs most recent workout (or perhaps the average of their
 
liked workouts). With this model, the score would be a similarity measure between the
 
workouts based on duration, calorie burn, difficulty level, etc. If we also gathered the workout
 
descriptions, we could perform text mining and take into account the similarity of the workout
 
descriptions as well. A content based recommender would be useful because it would give
 
personalized recommendations that are purely based on the userʼs history and not other users
 
(unlike our collaborative filtering model). This would be appealing to users who want to
 
understand exactly where their recommendations are coming from.
 
 
All in all, with several recommendation options and the inclusion of filtering for user
 
preferences and needs, as well as a user friendly and intuitive interface, Asnapp is poised to
 
give value to anyone looking to find workout video recommendations. We hope that Asnapp is
 
able to provide people with an easy and engaging way to build their at-home workout routines.

 ","Asnapp is a web application that provides personalized recommendations for workout videos. It solves the problem of finding suitable workout routines for home workouts by offering personalized recommendations based on fitness needs, time constraints, and equipment availability. The application scrapes workout data from Fitness Blender and uses user comments to train recommendation models. Three models are evaluated: random, top popular, and a collaborative filtering model. The web application allows users to login, choose a model, view recommendations, and interact with the workouts. Future improvements include adding more recommender options and enhancing user preferences."

Abstract
Existing
options
for
recipe
recommendations
are
less
than
satisfactory.
We
sought
to
solve
this
problem
by
creating
our
own
recommendation
system
hosted
on
a
website.
Using
recipe
data
from
Food.com,
we
created
a
classifier
to
identify
cuisines
of
recipes,
a
popularity
based
recommender,
and
a
content-based
filtering
recommender
using
cosine
similarity.
In
the
future,
we
would
like
to
improve
upon
this
recommender
by
exploring
alternative
ways
to
model
ingredients,
by
tracking
implicit/explicit
data
of
a
user,
and
by
creating
a
hybrid
recommender
using collaborative techniques.
1 Introduction
A
recommender
system
is
an
important
application
of
data
science
that
serves
to
generate
item
recommendations
that
would
be
interesting
and
relevant
to
a
user.
Recommender
systems
are
integral
to
the
successes
of
the
music,
news,
and
even
social
networking
industries,
but
its
applications
in
the
recipe/culinary
industry still have room for improvement.
With
our
hectic
and
unpredictable
daily
schedules,
it
can
be
easy
to
rely
on
convenient
and
unhealthy
foods
that
detriment
our
health.
And
oftentimes,
indecisiveness
in
meal
preparation
can
lead
to
monotonous
and
unenjoyable
meals.
Typically,
in
searching
for
a
recipe,
one
either
finds
very
tedious
recipe
blogs
that
take
too
much
time
to
actually
view
the
recipe
details,
or
they
find
overly
complicated
recipe
websites
that
can
require
a
membership
or
profile
in
order
to
access
recipes.
Finding
great
recipes
that
accommodate
your
preferences
should
not
be
this
difficult,
and
so
the
goal
of
this
project
was
to
develop
a
recipe
recommender
system
that
suggests
interesting
recipes
based
on
filters
that
the
user
could
input
such
as
ingredients,
cook
time,
and
cuisine
type.
The
final
output
of
our
project
is
a
simple
website
where
users can easily select filters to generate recipes.
2 Target Goal
The
target
of
our
recommender
system
using
the
recipe
datasets
we
have
gathered,
is
to
be
able
to
give
recipe
recommendations
given
limited
information
about
the
user.
The
goal
is
to
make
the
recommender
as
user
friendly
as
possible
removing
the
need
to
create
any
accounts
or
feel
any
sort
of
long-term
commitment
to
the
model.
The
recommender
should
recommend
recipes
to
users
given
ingredients
the
user
has
lying
around
or
plans
to
get
sometime
soon.
This
model
prevents
food
waste
by
giving
suggestions
as
to
what
users
could
do
with
leftover
ingredients.
It
also
diversifies
the
user’s
palate
by
giving
recipe
suggestions
that
may
not
have
been
known
to
the
user beforehand.
If
we
are
able
to
provide
recipe
recommendations
that
both
allow
users
to
utilize
the
ingredients
they
have
lying
around,
and
try
new
recipes
that
they
may
not
have
had
before
then
our
recommender
system
would
have
done
its
job.
3 Dataset
The
main
dataset
we
are
using
for
our
project
was
acquired
from
a
Kaggle
user
named
Shuyang
Li
[1],
but
the
dataset
was
scraped
from
Food.com.
The
dataset
contains
8
files.
Three
of
the
files
from
the
dataset
were
pre-processed
files
that
the
Kaggle
user
created
for
their
specific
project.
Another
three
files
contained
the
train,
test,
and
validation
sets
the
Kaggle
user
used
in
training
and
testing
their
models.
We
did
not
use
any
of
these
6
files
in
our
project.
Instead,
we
used
the
remaining
two
files.
The
first
file
contained
the
raw
recipes
scraped
from
Food.com.
This
file
was
the
scraped
recipe
data
whichheld
a
variety
of
information
about
each
recipe
from
Food.com.
There
is
information
on
the
amount
of
time
each
recipe
takes,
what
the
nutritional
information
about
the
recipe
is,
what
users
have
tagged
the
recipe
with,
etc.
The
second
file
contained
interaction
data.
This
file
had
information
about
what
user
tried
what
recipe
and
what
they
rated
it.
There
is
also
information
as
to
when
the
review was submitted.
We
also
utilized
a
second
dataset
from
Kaggle
uploaded
by
Kaggle
[2].
This
second
dataset
was
used
to
fill
in
some
of
the
shortcomings
of
the
first
dataset.
The
first
dataset
had
a
variety
of
information
about
each
recipe,
but
lacked
a
column
specifying
what
type
of
cuisine
it
fell
under.
This
second
dataset
from
Kaggle
had
data
on
different
recipes,
what
ingredients
are
used,
and
what
cuisine
type
they
fell
under.
Using
the
ingredients
data
from
the
second
dataset,
we
were
able
to
train
a
Random
Forest
Classifier
up
to
~75%
accuracy
to
predict
cuisine type of each recipe in the first dataset.
This
is
not
a
perfect
solution
and
carries
with
it
its
own
set
of
limitations.
Since
not
every
recipe
in
the
first
dataset
appeared
in
the
second
dataset,
we
could
not
directly
map
cuisine
types
from
the
second
dataset
to
the
first.
What
this
means
is
that
we
could
be
mislabeling
many
of
the
recipes
in
the
first
dataset
without
any
way
of
verifying.
There
are
also
cases
where
two
recipes
seem
very
similar
and
are
likely
the
same,
but
have
different
names.
The
different
names
could
be
a
factor
of
which
culture
or
person
named
the
recipe,
and
as
such
is
difficult
to
identify.
This
also
prevented
us
from
directly
mapping
recipe
cuisine
types
from
the
second
dataset
to
the
first.
Though
even
with
the
two
issues
we
faced
the
model
still
performed
relatively
well
on
the
test
data
provided,
and
so
the
model
should
be
generalizable.
Some
example
recipes
and
their
cuisine
classifications
are shown below:
Image 1: Sample dataset
As
you
can
see
the
recipes
are
classified
as
expected,
with
both
“italian
sandwich
pasta
salad”
and
“italian
fries” being classified as italian cuisines.
Since
both
datasets
were
found
on
Kaggle,
the
data
was
already
close
to
being
completely
clean
and
did
not
require
any
pre-processing.
The
only
thing
we
did
to
clean
the
data
was
we
removed
some
recipes
from
the
dataset
that
had
ridiculously
long
cooking
times
of
several
months
or
years.
We
assumed
that
these
recipes
were
posted
by
trolls,
and
were
not
actually
real
recipes.
This
is
an
assumption
we
made
as
a
group,
however,
as
it
is
possible
that
these
are
real
recipes
that
we
are
just
not
familiar
with.
Though
even
if
we
did
not
have
to
clean
the
data
much,
we
still
conducted
some
simple
exploratory
data
analysis
to
gain
a
better
understanding
of the datasets.
Figure 1: The format of the recipe dataset
Figure
1
depicts
a
quick
snapshot
of
what
the
recipe
dataset
looks
like.
There
are
12
different
columns
with
236,637
rows.
Each
column
title
very
accurately
describes what is stored in that column.
Figure 2: The format of the user interaction dataset
Figure
2
depicts
a
quick
snapshot
of
what
the
user
interaction
dataset
looks
like.
There
are
5
different
columns
with
over
1
million
rows.
Each
column
title
for
this
dataset
also
accurately
describes
what
is
stored
in
that column.
Figure
3:
A
table
displaying
the
different
descriptive
statistics
from
the
recipe dataset
Figure 4: A bar chart with the distribution of ratings
Figure 5: A histogram depicting the number of reviews
left by most users
From
figures
4
and
5
it
is
clear
that
the
data
is
somewhat
skewed.
The
distribution
of
ratings
appears
to
be
left
skewed
while
the
number
of
reviews
by
users
appears
to
be
right
skewed.
The
data
does
not
appear
to
be
normally
distributed
and
most
users
appear
only
a
few
times.
With
so
little
individual
data
it
is
likely
going
to
be
very
difficult
to
build
a
strong
recommender
model
based
on
these
user
interactions.
Furthermore
the
skewed
ratings
could
cause
a
bias
in
the
recommender
model
where
most
recommendations
are
predicted
to
have
high
ratings.
4 Method
For
this
project
the
goal
is
to
provide
viable
recipe
recommendations
to
users
of
our
models.
To
do
this
we
have
set
a
two
stage
model
setup.
We
have
a
most
popular
model
running
as
the
secondary
model
and
cosine
similarity
running
as
the
main
model.
The
cosine
similarity
model
provides
the
bulk
of
the
recommendations,
but
when
there
are
edge
cases
or
when
the
user
does
not
input
enough
information
to
return
good
recommendations
the
most
popular
model
substitutes
to
generate the remaining recommendations.
5 Model
Two
models
were
developed
to
offer
recipe
recommendations
to
users.
The
first
model
is
a
simple
top
popular
recommender
that
predicts
the
most
popular
recipe
to
all
users,
and
the
second
model
which
acts
as
the
main
model
utilizes
Cosine
Similarity
to
conduct
a
form of Collaborative Filtering.
5.1 Most Popular (MP)
This
trivial
baseline
model
is
a
most
popular
prediction
model.
This
model
worked
by
calculating
the
average
rating
of
every
recipe
type
normalized
by
the
number
of
users
that
have
tried
the
recipe.
This
would
give
every
recipe
a
rank
of
sorts.
Once
this
rank
is
decided
the
model
would
predict
whether
a
user
would
like
a
recipe
based
on
how
it
ranked
overall.
The
model
only
recommends
high
ranking
recipes
to
users,
and
as
such
it
is
not
personalized.
Though
surprisingly
the
model
still
performs
relatively
well.
Using
ratings
of
4
stars
and
higher
as
the
user
liked
it,
and
3
stars
and
lower
as
the
user
does
not,
the
most
popular
recommender
still
scored
a
relatively
low
balanced
error
rate
of
0.34.
This
makes
sense,
however,
as
the
recipes
are
the
most
popular
for
a
reason
so
it
should
not
be
surprising
that
many
users
would like them.
This
model
was
chosen
as
it
is
simple
to
implement,
and
pretty
accurate
given
its
simplicity.
The
model
is
also
scalable
and
has
no
parameters
to
tune
making
it
an
ideal
choice
for
a
baseline
model
or
a
model
used
in
an
AdaBoost
algorithm.
An
AdaBoost
algorithm
is
an
algorithm
that
compiles
multiple
quick
and
easy
to
implement
machine
learning
models
with
subpar
results
into a combined model with much better results.
5.2 Cosine Similarity
To
deliver
a
set
of
recommendations,
we
use
content-based
filtering
as
our
method
of
candidate
generation.
A
content-based
filtering
method
compares
items
to
other
items
based
on
their
features
to
calculate
a
similarity
score.
Using
this
similarity
score
in
addition
to
explicit
information
a
user
has
given,
we
can
return
a
set
of
recommendations.
For
our
implementation,
we
used
cosine similarity as our measure.
cosine similarity(A,B) =𝑖𝑛∑𝐴𝑖×𝐵𝑖
𝑖𝑛∑𝐴𝑖2 ×𝑖𝑛∑𝐵𝑖2  
(2)
Where:
: number of ingredients𝑛
   
: the i
th
value of ingredient vector A𝐴𝑖
   
: the i
th
value of ingredient vector B𝐵𝑖
Our
cosine
similarity
formula
relies
on
the
input
of
two
ingredient
vectors
A
and
B.
An
ingredient
vector
is
an
embedding
of
a
list
of
ingredients
for
a
given
recipe.
A
user
interacts
with
our
recommender
by
inputting
a
list
of
ingredients
that
are
available
in
their
kitchen.
This
a
text
input
that
is
comma
separated.
We
then
take
this
input
and
transform
it
into
a
list
of
strings.
This
list
of
strings
is
then
transformed
using
a
MultiLabelBinarizer
that
has
been
trained
on
an
entire
dataset
of
recipes
that
each
have
a
list
of
ingredients.
The
transformed
input
is
now
a
vector
of
n
dimensions,
n
being
the
total
number
of
unique
ingredients
in
the
dataset.
The
value
of
each
element
is
binary.
This
transformation
is
very
similar
to
a
bag
of
words
model,
as
we
only
care
about
the
presence
of an ingredient in a recipe.
This
process
occurs
for
both
the
input
ingredients
and
every
recipe
in
the
dataset.
This
places
every
recipe
as
a
vector
in
an
n
dimensional
space.
Cosine
similarity
is
then
used
to
help
us
determine
a
distance
between
vectors.
The
vector
nearest
to
the
user’s
input
vector
is
considered the most similar to it.
Once
the
cosine
similarity
has
been
calculated
for
every
recipe,
filtering
is
done
to
exclude
recipes
based
on
the
user’s
input.
For
example,
a
user
may
decide
they
want
only
italian
dishes,
so
any
recipes
that
are
not
italian
are
removed.
This
filtering
is
done
for
cuisine
and
cook
time.
Finally,
the
remaining
recipes
are
then
sorted
in
descending
order
based
on
similarity
and
we
output
the
top five recommendations.
5.3 Model Comparison
The
most
popular
model
is
the
easiest
model
to
create,
and
it
offered
viable
results
because
of
how
skewed
the
data
is
to
begin
with.
It
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
outputs
for
predictions
are
in
the
range
of
0
to
5.
Though
over
half
of
the
dataset
had
ratings
of
4
or
higher.
As
such
a
flat
recommender
would
also
likely
perform
very
well.
The
most
complicated
model
is
the
cosine
similarity
model.
This

6 Conclusion
Recommender
systems
exist
in
a
variety
of
places.
For
the
space
of
cooking,
the
current
options
available
to
get
a
recommendation
for
what
to
make
are
lackluster.
They
suffer
from
being
clunky
and
not
straight
to
the
point.
This
makes
getting
results
more
difficult
for
the
user.
To
resolve
this
issue,
we
sought
to
create
our
own
recommendation
system
and
deploy
it
on
a
website
so
that it can be used by anyone.
This
was
accomplished
by
taking
in
a
recipe
dataset
from
Kaggle,
classifying
the
cuisines
of
each
recipe,
and
creating
two
recommender
systems.
The
first
recommender
gives
the
user
a
list
of
the
most
popular
recipes.
The
second
is
dependent
upon
the
user
inputting
a
list
of
ingredients
they
have
available
and
delivers
recommendations
based
on
cosine
similarity
between
the
input
and
existing
recipes
in
the
dataset.
We
then
deployed
this
recommender
as
a
website
that
any
person
can visit and use.
In
the
future,
we
would
like
to
revise
and
improve
this
recommender
system,
both
from
the
perspective
of
the
model
and
from
the
perspective
of
the
website.
We
chose
cosine
similarity
for
flexibility,
as
it
could
also
handle
a
change
in
how
to
vectorize
ingredients.
We
might
want
to
try
going
for
something
similar
to
TF-IDF
for
a
user’s
history
of
ingredients.
Additionally,
we
may
want
to
go
for
a
hybrid
approach
by
implementing
an
account
system
for
users
to
start
building
a
set
of
explicit
and
implicit
data
for
us
to
use
to
start
mixing
in
collaborative
methods.

Makeup Recommender Report
 
 
I.
Abstract
 
Although product recommenders are conventional in the world of machine learning based
 
recommender systems, cosmetics are an overlooked field. By providing a complete set of
 
cosmetic recommendations, we can reduce the time and effort required for users to find the best
 
products for a user’s personalized needs. Our goal is to create a recommender that will provide a
 
one-stop shop experience where a user will get recommended an array of products to create an
 
entire makeup look based on similar products that the user enjoys, products that similar users
 
have purchased, as well as products that are personalized to the user including skin type, skin
 
tone, ingredient preferences, and budget. The website recommends a complete makeup set
 
personalized to the user. The user inputs their skin type, skin tone, budget, and any ingredient
 
preferences so that we can suggest the best products for their personalized needs. The user also
 
inputs a product of their choice from one of the four categories to aid with further
 
personalization. Using this preference and knowledge about the user, we will suggest a complete
 
set of products to complete a look. Our recommender provides four categories of products: face,
 
cheeks, eyes, and lips. Our project utilizes collaborative filtering recommendations to ensure user
 
satisfaction and success when creating their desired look.
 
 
II.
Description of Data
 
The dataset is scraped from Sephora.com using Selenium to acquire products and review
 
information from the four categories of face, cheek, eyes, and lips. Initial products were scraped
 
on 1/4/21 and all reviews were scraped by 1/24/21. We collected up to 300 reviews per product,
 
sorted by most helpful. Our dataset includes explicit feedback on each product in the form of
 
numbers of stars received. Steps of data pre-processing include encoding the ingredients.

Method
 
A.
Baseline Comparison Method
 
To ensure that our model is working properly and effectively, we must compare it to a
 
baseline method. We chose Top Popular as this baseline, so that users have the choice to
 
see recommendations from this model as well. The Top Popular model returns the top
 
most popular products for each category of makeup. Popularity is determined by the
 
number of reviews a product has received.
 
 
B.
Recommender model
 
1.
Collaborative filtering
 
Since our data contains users and product reviews, we chose to include
 
collaborative filtering in our model. Collaborative filtering uses similarities of
 
users and items to recommend products. Our model recommends items based on
 
the assumption that people enjoy products that are enjoyed by other users with
 
similar taste. Based on a user’s previous reviews, user-based collaborative
 
filtering calculates the similarity between the target user and all of the other users.
 
Two users are deemed similar if they rate items similarly. The model weights the
 
ratings from the similar users and predicts the rating of the new items for the
 
target user.

Figure 1: Diagram of collaborative filtering approach
 
 
It should be noted that collaborative filtering has a cold start problem. If an item
 
has not been reviewed by enough users, the model cannot use it in its
 
recommendations. Our model uses up to 300 reviews per product, though ideally
 
we would gather all of the reviews for each product.
 
 
2.
Additional Filtering
 
Once we have received the initial recommendations from the collaborative
 
filtering model, we must further personalize the recommendations according to
 
the user’s preferences. The final step in our recommendations is to perform basic
 
filtering on the following:
 
-
Budget: ensure that the total cost of the products recommended are less
 
than or equal to the budget selected
 
-
Ingredient preferences: ensure that the products recommended do not
 
contain ingredients from the ingredient group(s) (rubber, preservatives,
 
fragrances, metals) selected
 
 
C. Website
 
Our website was built using the Python package, Streamlit. Stylistic touches were added
 
with CSS. It includes a section for the user to enter their skin information along with their
 
preferences such as ingredients and budget. To deploy our functional website publicly,
 
we utilized Heroku to generate the following domain for our website:
 
https://makeup-recommender.herokuapp.com/
​
.
 
 
 
IV.
Metrics
 
To measure the effectiveness of our recommendations, we calculated the AUC, or area under the
 
curve. The AUC is an estimate of the probability that a classifier will rank a randomly chosen
 
positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative instance. It measures the model’s skill
 
in ranking recommendations, which is a key idea for our model. The higher the AUC the better
 
the model is at distinguishing between the positive and negative classes. The scores can range
 from 0 to 1, with 1 being a perfect classifier. A score of 0.5 suggests no discrimination between
 
positive and negative instances.
 
 
 
V.
Results
 
A.
AUC Score
 
The current AUC for our model lies at 0.68, with a train-test split of 0.9, 0.1 respectively.
 
This is a decent score representing an acceptable job of predicting items in each category
 
that the user would enjoy. We noticed that when we add more data, our AUC increments,
 
so we believe that one aspect of improving our AUC is a matter of obtaining more data.
 
 
B.
User Studies
 
 
The results of our user studies allowed us to tailor our product and website to be more
 
useful and user friendly. After showing the website prototype to our peers, family, and
 
friends we gained helpful feedback about features that would enhance the user experience
 
of our site. These improvements included a helpful guide on how to determine one’s skin
 
type, images to aid in choosing a skin tone, and a depiction of how to find product IDs on
 
Sephora’s website. Taking these suggestions into consideration, we made modifications
 
to the website’s functionality, features, and stylistic properties.
 
 
 
VI.
Conclusion
 
The beauty industry is in need of recommenders that not only work for a diverse range of
 
individuals, but also ones that can recommend an array of products so that the user can
 
effortlessly create a complete look. Our recommender provides a one-stop shop for users to get
 
recommended an entire set of makeup products needed to create a complete makeup aesthetic.
 
These products not only align with the user’s physical characteristics but also with the type of
 
makeup look that the user desires. The model uses collaborative filtering to make
 
recommendations on similar users who have purchased the same products. These products are
 
then filtered even further to cater to user characteristics and preferences such as allergy and
 
budget.
 
A.
Limitations
 
A limitation to our approach is the amount of data we have in our dataset. Ideally, we
 
would gather all the reviews for every product in our dataset; however, this was not a
 
feasible task due to lack of time. Our web scraper is slow, so we are not detected as bots
 
and are blocked from using the website. Therefore, we had to limit the number of reviews
 
to up to 300 reviews per product. We were also limited by structural changes in the
 
website while we were scraping data. We had to make several changes to our web scraper
 
further limiting our ability to obtain more data.
 
The cold start problem with collaborative filtering models addresses another limitation to
 
our approach. Since products with more reviews tend to get weighted more and products
 with minimal reviews get weighted less, there is a slight popularity bias towards products
 
that have many reviews. Newer products will get recommended less because they have
 
less reviews. However, this does not mean that newer products are bad and should not be
 
recommended, but because of the nature of our recommender, there is a bias towards
 
more established products and thus have more reviews. It is likely that products with no
 
reviews at all will not be recommended in our model.
 
 
B.
Future Work
 
Future work includes improving upon and fine tuning our collaborative filtering model to
 
yield a better accuracy. By including more products and reviews, we can improve the
 
results of our model. Additionally, we would like to polish our website further by
 
including images for the recommended products. This would help with the visual appeal
 
of our recommendations. Lastly, we would like to scrape products in real time to include
 
the most up to date products in our model. This would ensure that new products to
 
Sephora are included in our recommendations, and that discontinued products are
 
excluded.

Abstract —Drug usage is continuously increasing throughout
the world, causing problems such as rising mortality rates.
Especially in the time of the pandemic, behavioral changes
are inevitable. We proposed that by constructing a knowledge
graph from multiple data sources, we can know how COVID-19
has changed the situation for substance use. We observe news
announcements, along with reports by the Drug Enforcement
Agency (DEA) and social media posts from potential drug users.
Utilizing methods such as Natural Language Processing (NLP)
and behavior analysis, we aim to ultimately form a pipeline that
accepts input from the user to output partial knowledge graphs
that pertain to the information given.

I. I NTRODUCTION
The World Drug Report 2020 [1] observes that drug use
around the world has been on the rise, in terms of both overall
numbers and the proportion of the world’s population that uses
drugs. In 2009, the estimated 210 million users represented
4.8 per cent of global population aged 15–64, compared with
the estimated 269 million users in 2018, or 5.3 per cent
of the population. In North America, the use of synthetic
opioids such as fentanyl has fuelled two decades of increases
in opioid overdose deaths. In 2018, fentanyls were implicated
in two thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the
United States. At the same time, the drug business is also
shifting. For example, the manufacture of methamphetamine
was traditionally carried out in small-scale laboratories in the
United States to serve the domestic market. But this kind
of production seems now to be dwarfed by industrial-size
laboratories in Mexico. The methamphetamine seized in the
United States over the past few years is increasingly imported,
with the trade controlled by Mexican cartels. As recently as
Nov. 24, 2020, the Drug Enforcement Agency has seized
$3.5M in U.S. Currency and massive quantities of cocaine
and fentanyl in Otay Mesa of the San Diego County1across
from the Mexico border. These facts demonstrate that the
1https://www.dea.gov/press-releases/2020/11/24/
agents-seize-35-million-us-currency-and-massive-quantities-cocaineillicit substances not only pose a health hazard of epidemic
proportions, it is also a thriving industry that Federal, State
and Local law-enforcement agencies are trying to deter, but
new businesses, shifting target population, new manufacturing
units and ever-evolving distribution channels are constantly
changing the dynamics of the drug ecosystem.
Unfortunately, there is no public-domain information system
today that public health researchers can use to monitor, analyze
and model illicit drug related activities and their impact.
The lack of such an continuous monitoring and analysis is
particularly conspicuous during the current COVID-19 period,
which has signiﬁcantly disrupted the normal dynamics of the
drug ecosystem. While some trading routes have disappeared,
newer suppliers have sprung up to meet the increased demand
commensurate with the restrictions on travel and closed-
area congregations, the emergent work-from-home culture and
increased anxiety levels [2], [3].
The broad goal of the proposed project is to combine hetero-
geneous information integration, natural language processing
and machine learning techniques to construct a time-evolving
knowledge graph that will allow us to satisfy the analytical
needs of public health researchers interested in the impact
of the pandemic on the illicit substance marketplace. The
knowledge-graph we aim to construct will take the form of
an extended property graph model [4], and will be guided by
domain-speciﬁc research questions. Thanks to Prof. Annick
Borquez, Professor of Public Health, and the co-advisor of the
proposed project, we have identiﬁed three research questions
that we propose to answer based on the knowledge graph.
1) How are the nature and volume of drug-related conversa-
tion in social media and events in the news media changing
through the pre/during/post pandemic period?
2) Has there been a shift in the manner in which drugs/drug-
categories/drug-use-patterns are discussed in these media
through the pre/during/post pandemic period?
3) How have the discussions around mental health issues
including depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and loneli-
ness changed through the pre/during/post pandemic period?Since we model the knowledge graph as an instance of the
property graph data model [5], the entities (nodes), rela-
tionships (edges), node attributes and edge attributes of the
knowledge graph will be governed by these three research
questions.
A. Related work
Four of the works that informed our approach heavily and
should be mentioned are (as we call them), the Remine paper
[6], the AutoPhrase paper [7], the PREDOSE paper [8], the
MentalHealth paper [9]
II. S TUDY DESIGN
A. Data Sources
Based on the research questions, we have identiﬁed three
kinds of data sources that will inform our knowledge graph.
1)Terminology Sources. These sources include ontologies
(e.g., RxNorm) that contains the scientiﬁc, generic and
street names of drugs, classiﬁcations of drug families,
”prescription terms” of drugs and drug strengths, as well
asdictionaries for names of locations and various Govern-
ment Agencies related to drug administration, control, law
enforcement and epidemics.
2)Social Media. Social media data captures public per-
ceptions but tends to be noisy due free-ﬂowing con-
versation that may be irrelevant. We have selected
Reddit ( www.reddit.com )and its different topical
forums for general conversation around drugs. The
queries and subreddits we used to collect reddit data:
Queries : ”xanax”, ”heroin”, ”weed”, ”meth”, ”DEA”,
”FBI”, ”THC”, ”COVID”, ”Coronavirus”, ”Corona”, ”opi-
ates”, ”hydros”, ”hydrocodone”, ”opiate”, ”opioid”, ”best”,
”fentanyl”, ”heroin”, ”adderall”, ”amps”, ”speed”, ”am-
phetamine”, ”stims”, ”stimulant”, ”hydro”, ”oxy”, ”hy-
drocodone”, ”oxycodone”, ”subs”, ”suboxone”, ”xannies”
Subreddits : drugs, researchchemicals, opiates, stims, co-
caine,
B. Assumptions
To address the research challenges within the scope of
our Capstone Project, we will make a number of simplify-
ing assumptions during knowledge modeling and information
extraction from our data sources.
(a) Drug-related information often have multiple levels of
granularity. For example, a drug may be speciﬁed by
name, name+dose, name+form, and so forth. We stan-
dardized these entities to the drug type.
(b) We treated different drug combinations occurring in
sentences as their own entities without considering any
complex semantic connections within the sentence. How-
ever, we included the names of the individual drugs as
properties of these compound entity nodes.
(c) For each text source, we considered only sentences con-
taining two or more signiﬁcant entity candidates and
assume these will constitute most of our informative
sentences.(d) We used results from existing literature to identify mental
health related comments from social media data. We
assumed that news articles do not have mental health
related information.
C. Methods
We used the ontology list as our dictionary to extract the
drug terms as our entity. We performed similar matching on
our social media data and found all sentences that contain at
least one drug term. The Drug term is one type of our entity
in the knowledge graph. Another type of entity is the noun
chunks that appear in the same post as the drug term.
To generate relationships between noun phrases and drug
terms, especially, long-range associations between terms. We
used a state-of-the-art relationship extraction method Blank-
Matching [10]. Unfortunately, the eight default relationships
did not work well on our social media data. So we tried
to deﬁne our own relationships Drug-Consumption, Drug-
Comment, Drug-Consequence that ﬁt in with the social media
drug discussion content. We generated some training data for
these three relations and use them to tune the Blank-Matching
[10] package. However, because of the messiness of social
media content and limited time in this project, our training
data size is limited which did not lead to an effective result.
So we did not include the output relationship in our result.
To answer our third research question regarding mental
health issues, we used behavior analysis on the textual content
to identify the emotional state of the sentence. We used a
similar approach as prior study [9]. An emotion analysis
package Limbic [11] and manually deﬁned lexicons (e.g.
suicidal tendencies, isolation, domestic stress) were used to
classify emotion from sentences. The emotion scores are also
marked as an attribute of the drug entity.
III. R ESULT
(a) The volume of drug-related conversations in Reddit
increased signiﬁcantly after the COVID-19 pandemic.
From PRE-COVID (2019/03-2020/03) to MID-COVID
(2020/03-2021/03): The total posts/comments number in
drug-related SubReddit increased from 5047 to 16834.
[Fig 1]
(b) The most discussed drugs have also changed during
the COVID-19 pandemic. Smoke is the most popular
term before COVID (14.9 percent of posts or com-
ments contained it). During COVID-19, the occurrence of
Smoke decreased to 8.1 percentage (z=-14.512, p=1.014e-
47). Mention of Heroin increased from 7 percentage
to 10.7 percentage(z= 7.900,p=2.798e-15). Mention of
Alcohol increased from 2 percentage to 3 percentage (z=-
3.749,p=1.779e-4) [Fig 2 3]
(c) Emotion expressed in online drug discussion also changed
in COVID-19 pandemic. Within eight basic emotion cat-
egory, Anger, Disgust, Anticipation, Trust, Joy, Surprise,
Fear, Sadness ,Trust and Disgust have changed signiﬁcant.
The score for Trust have increased 0.012 (mean=0.252,t=2.634, p=0.008), and score for disgust have decreased
0.009 (mean=0.141, t=-2.349, p=0.018)
Fig. 1.
Fig. 2. Top mentioned drugs before COVID-19
Fig. 3. Top mentioned drugs during COVID-19
IV. C ONCLUSION
The results stated above were indicative of our initial
assumption that the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to a
signiﬁcant change in online drug discussion. The number
of drug-related conversations increased signiﬁcantly in social
media and the most talked-about drug categories also have
notable changes. In addition, the emotions that were related
to such discussion also went through statistically signiﬁcant
changes from the pre-pandemic period to the current day.
These changes possibly reﬂect the changes in people’s drug-
use patterns as well.
The COVID-19 pandemic led to people staying home more
often, usually in an isolated situation. With more time spent
alone and at home, people may rely more on drugs or decide
to try new drugs as well. The resulting consequences tend
to be relatively harder to notice as they usually manifest in
mental health issues or non-tangible symptoms. Social media
can help reveal some of these changes which makes it an
important information source.

The goal is to create a pipeline that can generate partial knowledge graphs based on user input. The report also outlines three research questions related to changes in drug-related conversations in social media and news media during the pandemic, shifts in the discussion of drugs/drug categories/drug-use patterns, and changes in discussions around mental health issues. The study design section describes the data sources used, including terminology sources and social media data from Reddit. Assumptions are made during knowledge modeling and information extraction, and methods such as ontology matching, relationship extraction, and behavior analysis are employed. The results indicate that drug-related conversations on Reddit have increased significantly during the pandemic, with changes in the most discussed drugs. Emotions expressed in online drug discussions have also changed. These findings suggest that the pandemic has led to changes in people's drug-use patterns."

Abstract
BRICK is a schema for representing various building equipment, including but not limited to, HV AC air han-
dling units and carbon dioxide sensors in di ﬀerent rooms. While the schema is a clear step up over the current
state-of-the-art, its potential is severely hindered because it is not backwards compatible. This means that con-
verting CSV ﬁles storing building data to a BRICK-compatible data format is a cumbersome and imperfect
process as di ﬀerent systems use di ﬀerent conventions to denote the same systems. This conversion usually
required human involvement until now. AUTOBRICK is a software tool that automates this conversion with
minimal human intervention and provides an order of magnitude greater speed up (90x) over the current state
of the art.
1Introduction
Today, several commercial buildings have sought to lever-
age the power of cyber-physical systems for optimal energy
consumption, planned facility maintenance, machine learning
(ML) applications, etc., to augment user experience. However,
their data collection /ETL methodologies dont conform to a
uniform schema to enable buildings to interact with each other
or streamline the process of analytics and ML at scale. The
US building industry su ﬀers a loss of $1.5B /year due to the
lack of interoperable warehousing between di ﬀerent buildings
[1]. Brick o ﬀers a comprehensive schema to represent arbitrary
buildings metadata, build programmatic platforms for commer-
cial buildings, improve interoperability between di ﬀerent build-
ings, and pave the way for well-deﬁned ways of analyses re-
lated to planned maintenance and machine learning, etc. [ 1].
Converting arbitrary metadata schema to Brick (i.e., ’Brickiﬁca-
tion’) is a slow process bogged down by manual interventions
into partially-automated processes and grunt work. This pro-
cess involves custom data transformations, object-relationship
deﬁnitions, and manually plugging intermediate results into var-
ious heterogeneous frameworks to get a Turtle ﬁle parseable
by Brick. A Turtle ﬁle is a data format that expresses data
in a RDF model which can be used to store graph-like info
for relationships between di ﬀerent entities, in this case, build-
ing sub-systems and sensors. Di ﬀerent kinds of building point
label (metadata string) formats that sabotage the notion of a
one-size ﬁts all solution further intensify these challenges. Ad-
ditionally, this is also motivated by real-life use cases such as
the COVID-19 global pandemic, where the public safety regula-
tions in indoor environments (classrooms, o ﬃces, etc.) remain
a massively unsolved research question and challenge at scale.
2Background
The traditional Brickiﬁcation workﬂow involves:1.an open-source Excel-like tool called OpenReﬁne,
where users need to perform manual data transforma-
tions [ 2],
2.a Reconciliation API, to infer the class of speciﬁc ob-
jects in terms of Bricks vocabulary [ 3],
3.Entity-relationship deﬁnitions in a .txt ﬁle, to utilize in
the turtle ﬁle [ 4], and
4.a tool called Brick Builder to convert the processed
data into its turtle ﬁle [ 5].
As symbolized in Figure 1, the data transformations and most
of the API injections and integrations need to be manually done
by the user. The BrickBuilder tool is the only component to au-
tomate the last part of this workﬂow. We recognize the research
and practical utility of the frameworks already created for use
in the old Brickiﬁcation workload. We dont seek to reinvent the
wheel here but address automation, acceleration, and scalability
improvements on top of these existing systems.

per the tutorial in [ 2]Preprint – AUTOBRICK: A system for end -to-end automation of building point labels to Brick turtle files 2
3OurFramework
Figure 2: The proposed workﬂow through AUTOBRICK
AUTOBRICK is an end-to-end system for automating and ac-
celerating the conversion of point labels into turtle ﬁles with
Brick terminology, which can be visualized, queried, and uti-
lized by the Brick programming platform. As displayed in Fig-
ure2, the tool takes a conﬁguration ﬁle where users can declar-
atively specify all details about their data and workload (related
to data location, point label format details, and additional pars-
ing details). AUTOBRICK automates all needed data transfor-
mations to pre-process the point labels and extract relevant in-
formation of various units /sensors and categories related to spe-
ciﬁc building objects. AUTOBRICK utilizes pre-written /pre-
loaded standard ER /RDF speciﬁcations and existing APIs to in-
ject and stitch them on the pre-processed data as per the original
sequence of steps followed for Brickiﬁcation. We recognize the
research and practical utility of the frameworks already created
for use in the old Brickiﬁcation workload and address automa-
tion, acceleration, and scalability improvements on top of the
existing implementations.
AUTOBRICK allows for ﬂexibility in using arbitrary CSV ﬁles
and chosen /speciﬁed point label formats. With the project, we
give the power in the users hands for them to decide the ap-
propriate dataset parsing /preprocessing strategies, rather than
making unveriﬁed assumptions about point label structures or
utilizing unreliable custom static analysis or auto-generation
techniques. AUTOBRICK has already ""brickiﬁed "" 41 point
label datasets of various buildings in UCSDs Engineering De-
partment, reducing the need for human intervention to a matter
of minutes. Initial experiments and demos have already show-
cased Autobrickify reducing 10-15 mins of manual grunt work
as part of ""brickifying "" one dataset (as part of the tutorial in
[2]) to a matter of <10 seconds, achieving orders-of-magnitude
(over 90x) speed-ups and scalability!
4Methods
We use a combination of python and shell scripts to execute
the workload in terms of the core logic to parse the point labels
and loading and injecting pre-existing APIs at di ﬀerent stages
of the process. To automate data transformations, we use the
pandas module to load the data in memory and leverage the sup-
plied conﬁgurations to perform data manipulations with in-built
functions provided by the module to identify objects /pieces of
equipment such as AHUs, Zones, V A Vs, and their correspond-
ing class types.Utilizing shell, we write some custom scripts to clone the APIs,
load them in the execution environment, and call them accord-
ing to their instructions to supply the pre-processed data to
their API function calls automatically. Because modules such
as pandas are pre-installed in a standard python environment,
the tool doesnt have any unique dependencies. It just needs
to rely on the brick-builder APIs dependencies (i.e., two mod-
ules, brickschema and rdﬂib). The lack of dependencies further
makes the tool lightweight for smooth usage. The requirements
are directly taken (and hence can even be updated) from the
loaded APIs themselves, making it seamless to piggyback on
top of the APIs made for Brickiﬁcation.
Figure 3: We can also use the Brick Viewer tool [ 5] to eyeball
the relationship graph of the building sub-systems.
Our validation process involves both automated and manual as-
pects. Since we don’t have any target ﬁles to compare our
outputs with, we use domain experts working under our men-
tor. Domain experts carefully go through the generated turtle
ﬁles and verify if the outputs match their expectations. The
automated component involves running some automated test
queries on the generated ﬁles to ensure that the graphical model
can be parsed error-free, and weve showcased some of such
queries in one of our demos as well.
5WorkExtensions
One of the biggest challenges faced in the Brickiﬁcation work-
ﬂow is the predictions of Brick Classes by the Reconciliation
API, which have only been around 30% accurate [ 2]. The Rec-
onciliation API uses an extensive key-value pair dictionary to
extract and attach relevant ontology for a sensor abbreviation in
a point label, but the API isnt comprehensive. Ultimately, the
turtle ﬁles need to be precisely correct for e ﬀective ETL and An-
alytics utilization. To mitigate this, we also formulated scripts
to extract additional key-value pairs from Johnson Controls doc-
umentation to update the API and get more accurate predictions.
However, this process of incorporating all key-value pairs may
never be fully comprehensive and is subject to future updates.
On the bright side, AUTOBRICK directly uses the latest ver-Preprint – AUTOBRICK: A system for end -to-end automation of building point labels to Brick turtle files 3
sion of the API, automatically reﬂecting better results as the
API improves.
The second part of augmenting the tools robustness relates to
dealing with point label values with an unequal number of splits
with the speciﬁed delimiters. In our current implementation,
we assume the point labels split into a uniform number of ele-
ments. For point labels that split into fewer values, we consider
these point-labels invalid (as we did encounter spurious point
label values during our testing). Filtering out these point-labels
renders the remaining values invalid. During the preprocessing
stage, we drop rows with any null values. In other words, we
treat point labels with the maximum number of splits possible
in the dataset as the only legitimate kind of point label value for
that dataset. Dealing with diverse but correct formats of point
labels in a single dataset is an open research question needing
collaboration with domain experts and is left to future work.
Finally, we also implemented a virtual reality front end to inter-
act and query with the automatically generated turtle ﬁles. The
environment is set up as a scene on a platform called ARENA
[6]. We set up a server that listens for events and user interac-
tions with the 3D objects in ARENA and translates those inter-
actions into queries performed on the BRICK-compatible build-
ing information. This environment allows us to map physical
spaces into equivalent virtual ones.
6Results and Conclusion
AUTOBRICK automates and accelerates a painfully manual
process, thereby empowering building management and ven-
dors to truly realize the power of data-driven applications and
advanced analytics to augment user experience in commercial
buildings. AUTOBRICK also gives rise to the potential of
representing building sub-systems as virtual spaces to reduce
the need for engineers to physically climb into the building’s
HV AC system equipment and virtually observe and interact
with sensor setpoints. To truly reap the beneﬁts of AUTO-
BRICK, the workﬂow and use case coverage need to be con-
tinually examined by domain experts and industry practitioners
to ensure the tool meets their needs at all times. This paper aims
to set the foundation for tangibly realizing smart buildings and
adopt technological advancements moving forward.

INTRODUCTION According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular disease, such as ischemic heart disease and stroke, is the leading cause of deaths globally. “The world’s biggest killer is ischemic heart disease, responsible for 16% of the world’s total deaths” [1]. We hope people can pay more attention to their health and reduce the chances of getting heart disease. Therefore, it would be very meaningful if we can use features and some health conditions of a person to determine the signals and the probability of whether he/she has cardiovascular disease. Based on previous knowledge and what we have learned last quarter, we can achieve such a goal by implementing logistic regression and large-scale multiple testing methods on a dataset with ample information.   2. DATASET & CLEANING  The dataset we use for this project is from Kaggle, called ‘Cardiovascular Disease dataset’ [2], which contains patients’ physical data collected at the moment of medical examination. The dataset has in total of 70,000 rows and 11 features, including patients’ age, height, weight, gender, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, and a binary target variable of the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease. To be specific, among these features, age, height, weight, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure are numerical variables, while the rest ones are categorical variables.  The dataset does not have any null value, or any data presented in strange format, so it’s already ready to use. The ‘cleaning’ process we actually did was conducting a few column transformations and added one column. The column transformation we performed was converting ‘age’ column (originally shown in days) into age groups from 30 to 65 years old, stepped by 5 year for the Exploratory Analysis, because having age in days makes it hard to . The column we added is called ‘ponderIndex’, which is ‘a measure of leanness of a person calculated as a relationship between mass and height’ [3], calculated by weight / height³. We create this column as we believe leanness is an important indicator of people’s health condition, which may be somewhat related to cardiovascular disease.  3. EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS  After data processing, we first conducted some exploratory analyses by simply making graphs. 3.1 Age and Cardiovascular disease 
 (Figure 3.1)   The side-by-side bar chart above (Figure 3.1) shows the number of patients who actually has cardiovascular disease (orange bars) and the number of patients who do not have such disease (blue bars) in different age groups. We can see that for patients younger or equal to 55 years old, the majority of patients do not have such disease, but for patients elder than 55 years old, the number of patients who actually has cardiovascular disease is larger than the number of patients who do not have such disease. Hence, it indicates a positive correlation between age and cardiovascular disease that elder people are more likely to get such disease.        
  3.2 Ponderal Index and Cardiovascular disease 
 （Figure 3.2.1）  The side-by-side bar chart above (Figure 3.2.1) shows the number of patients who actually has cardiovascular disease (orange bars) and the number of patients who do not have such disease (blue bars) in different Ponderal Index level groups. We can see that for patients with a less than 16 PI index, the majority of patients do not have such disease, but for patients with higher PI index, the number of patients who actually has cardiovascular disease is larger than the number of patients who do not have such disease. At the same time, 11-15 is just the normal PI index range for healthy adults [4]. Such coincidence shows PI index is a good feature to predict whether a person has cardiovascular disease, especially for people with a PI index higher than the normal range (obese people). 
 (Figure 3.2.2)  Figure 3.2.2 shows the finding from another perspective. It’s a scatterplot of all 70,000 patients’ weights vs heights, where blue dots represent health patients and orange dots represent patients with cardiovascular disease. The red curves are PI index of 11 and 15, so the area bounded by these two red curves is the normal range. We can see that clearly there are more blue dots than orange dots in this area, while the situation is opposite in the rest of area.             
3.3 Categorical Variables and Cardiovascular disease 
 (Figure 3.3)  The above bar plots (Figure 3.3) show the distributions of patients’ cholesterol, glucose, smoking, alcohol intake, and physical activity level. For cholesterol and glucose, value 1,2,3 mean normal, above normal, and well above normal; for smoking, alcohol intake, and physical activity, value 0,1 mean binary outcomes of do or not. The left plot is the distribution of patients who actually has cardiovascular disease while the plot at the right shows the distribution of patients who do not have such disease. Unlike other plots, these two plots do not show significant relationship or correlation between these features and the disease. Only one minor discovery is that for patients with cardiovascular disease, the proportion of patients with normal cholesterol level is much fewer than that from healthy patients, which means cholesterol may be related to the disease. Other analyzing methods need to be employed to closer examine the relationships between other variables and cardiovascular disease.      
3.4 Weight & Height & Gender 
 （Figure 3.4）  For visualization purpose, we also made a scatterplot of patients’ weights and heights (Figure 3.4), grouped by gender, where lighter pots are from females and darker pots are from males. The general pattern is quite normal that males are taller and heavier than females. However, what brings this plot to our attention is the exit of people with extremely low height and weight, given all the data is from adults. It’s not that plausible to have any adult with a weight of around 15kg or a height of around 50 cm. So, we suspect these are inaccurate data generated from mistakes while recording, and we plan to use empirical null distribution to find such outliers later.  4. METHODS & ANALYSIS 4.1 Feature Selection  Since the entire dataset have 12 features, we decided to first determine the combination of features we will use for the Regression model. By using the correlation function in python, we are able to find the correlation between ‘cardio’ which shows whether the person has the disease and the rest of the features as shown in Figure 4.1. 
 Using a list of threshold of [0.002, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2], we have generated 6 combinations of features for testing. After applying the different combinations of features to the Regression model, we get the accuracy score for each combination. Our final selection is the combination with the highest accuracy score, and it contains features of ['age', 'cholesterol', 'weight', 'gluc', 'ap_lo', 'ap_hi', 'gender', 'alco', 'height', 'smoke', 'active'].     Figure 4.1  4.2 Logistic Regression The goal of this particular analysis is to build a logistic regression model that predicts whether a person has Cardiovascular disease. We first select features for the model based on their correlations to the variable ‘cardio’ which indicates whether a person has Cardiovascular disease, and then we pick the set of features that produce the largest model accuracy score. Finally, the features that we use to make predictions are Age, Gender, Height, Weight, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol Level, Glucose Level, Alcohol Intake, Physical Activity and Smoking habit. The default detection threshold for the Logistic Regression model is set to 0.5. When training the Logistic Regression model with training data and making predictions on the test data, we get an accuracy score of 0.7187, which means 71.87% of the people in the test data are predicted correctly on whether they have Cardiovascular disease. But we know that the accuracy score of 0.7187 isn’t so great for a prediction model, so we decide to variate the detection threshold of the model and find different the balance between Type I and Type II errors to gain better accuracy. This first model is also set to be the baseline model for the project.  4.3 Thresholds & Rates In order to improve our baseline model, we generate a list of detection thresholds from 0.1 to 0.9 with a step of 0.01 for the model. While testing the model with different detection thresholds, we also record the True Positive, False Positive Rate, and False Discovery Rate for further analysis. The 45 degree line represents where the default threshold takes place.  
                         (Figure 4.3.1)                                                                                (Figure 4.3.2) 
                        (Figure 4.3.3)                (Figure 4.3.4)    During the detection threshold selection process, we have found that at the threshold of 0.48 (default is 0.5), the accuracy score is at its highest -- 0.7220, as shown in Figure 4.3.4. To prove the detection threshold of 0.48 is the optimal point, we have generated the three graphs above. In order for a threshold to be the optimal point, it must find balance between True Positive Rate, False Positive Rate, and False Discovery Rate. From figure 4.3.2 and figure 4.3.3, we can tell that the optimal point is somewhere around True Positive Rate of 0.7. When the detection threshold is 0.48, its True Positive Rate is 0.7037 which matches our observation. Therefore, we believe that the detection threshold of 0.48 is close to the optimal point we are looking for.   
 5. LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK  When using p0 estimation to find the proportion of outlier in the dataset, we concluded that p0 is not significantly different from 1, which means our outlier detection strategy is not quite perfect; p0 of 1 means that we were not able to apply the entire Empirical Null method to find the outliers. We then had to use the FDR and FPR graph to subjectively determine the upper and lower bound for both female and male height in order to eliminate outliers. Therefore, our dataset is possibly not fully cleaned, which negatively affect the model accuracy.  For future improvement, we have to gain a much better understanding of the data collection process of this dataset so that we can have more context on how to figure out the outlier detection strategy. But on Kaggle, we were not able to find any contextual information. For example, if possible, we would like to find out on what region was data collected, which we will able to get information about how tall people in that region will be. Then we can detect outliers more accurately.    6. CITATION [1]: WTO, The top 10 causes of death, 9 December 2020, https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death.

APPENDIX 7.1 Project Proposal: (Since we have changed topic from last quarter’s proposal, here is the modified version drafted at the beginning of this quarter.) Our proposed Quarter 2 project is to use statistical methods we have learned this quarter to find out whether a person is a Cardiovascular disease patient. According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular disease, such as ischemic heart disease and stroke, is the leading cause of deaths globally. “The world’s biggest killer is ischemic heart disease, responsible for 16% of the world’s total deaths” [1]. We hope people can pay more attention to their health and reduce the chances of getting heart disease. Therefore, it would be very meaningful if we can use features and some health conditions of a person to determine the signals and the probability of whether he/she has cardiovascular disease. Based on what we have learned last quarter, we can achieve such a goal by implementing logistic regression and large-scale multiple testing methods on a dataset with ample information. Last quarter, our domain collected equipment reading from neuroimaging of the brain and turned it into z-scores to detect significant regions using the empirical null distribution. For this quarter, we will be using a dataset that consists of 70 000 records of patient’s data, 11 features and target. The dataset values were collected at the moment of medical examination, and specifically, the features include ages, height, weight, gender, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity. The target variable is the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease. Our project output should be a report that communicates our purpose and finding to the general audience. It will include an introduction that describes the problem being researched and methods used, an exploratory section that talks about the dataset and data collection process, a methodology section that demonstrates methods used for investigation, a result section that illustrates our findings from each method, and lastly a conclusion section that summarizes the project in a self-explanatory way which anyone can understand. ","The study focuses on predicting cardiovascular disease using logistic regression and large-scale multiple testing methods. The dataset used contains 70,000 records with 11 features, including age, height, weight, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity. The exploratory analysis reveals a positive correlation between age and cardiovascular disease and suggests that the Ponderal Index is a good predictor for the disease. Logistic regression is used to build a prediction model with an accuracy score of 71.87%. Different detection thresholds are tested to improve the model's accuracy. The limitations of the study include incomplete outlier detection and lack of contextual information about the dataset."

Epidemiology Model

1 Introduction
1.1 Problem
The early state and late stage of a pandemic is very dierent. At early stage, the case number grows
exponentially. Government agencies and institutions want to the ability to forecast the number of cases in
order to allocated medical and other resources. Furthermore, knowing how protocols such as stay at home
order can aect the case number is extremely useful to make predictions. However, in order to predict number
of cases in the future, the growth factor is needed and can be generated from tting previous data to an
epidemiology model. The exponential factor is based on two factors that can be learned from data: the
infection rate, and number of days a patient stays infectious D.
1.2 Context
One of the pressing problems in epidemiology is long term prediction of the spreading of an infectious disease.
Of particular interest is how mitigation measures (government policies) can aect the number of infected
in the future. Numerous eorts have been tried around the world. Many cities and states in the U.S. have
ordered stay-at-home policies. It is useful to see how administering these orders can aect the case numbers,
how would the case numbers react if the government revoke the orders.[1] I
2 Data
We use data from JHU's public COVID-19 GitHub repository [2], and mobility data provided by Descarted
Lab [3].
2.1 Collection
The U.S. conrmed, death and recovered case is updated daily by regional health departments of dierent
jurisdictions, then collected by JHU, Because all the data is U.S. (unlike comparing data among dierent
countries), the testing method and data reporting method are relatively uniform and reliable to make
inferences on.
The mobility data is allocated from many sources. For example, Apple Map can estimate the distance a
typical person travel in that region from their back-end data of users moving in that geological areas.
2.2 Description
The pandemic hits dierent jurisdictions at a dierent time. Because the data set is collected by jurisdictions,
we are able to calculate growth factor and make predictions at county or state level.
1In order to t data to the epidemiology model, we need to have time series data of three variables,
estimated from conrmed, death, and recovered case numbers.
Infected;I= Conrmed Cases
Susceptible ;S= Population Conrmed Cases
Removed;R= Recovered + Deaths
The mobility data is representing the distance a typical member of a given population moves in a day.
With this data set, we are able to see how stay-at-home orders by dierent states and the pandemic itself
have eect on average mobility trends. The data set also provides additional information for our epidemiology
model. [We haven't touched on this yet]
3 Methods
3.1 Overview
We decided to predict the case number in 3/2/2021 of all the counties in California. We rst use gradient
descent method to nd infection rate and infection duration.
However, in reality, the case numbers of the entire country/state is not evenly distributed among counties.
Besides computing the individual infection rate for all the counties, each as a separate entity from its neighbors,
we will predict case numbers based on the mobility data provided by Descartes Labs[3] (how fast is people
moving inside each county and across county boundaries), and the case numbers of each county's neighboring
counties. We will use a dtaround 0.001 day instead of 1 day to better predict the dynamics. This process
requires a xed andDpredetermined for each county.
Furthermore, andDare also dynamic. So in the future, we will replace the xed andDwith dynamic,
changing according to the data.
3.2 Inferring Parameters
See Appendix 5.1 for code. We are using gradient descent to solve for and1

WhenandDboth converge (a.k.a is the same as the previous iteration), we stop the iterations and
return the two value, in order to t into the ODE model.
3.3 Determining Learning Rate
Lipschitz continuous gradient condition is essential to ensuring convergence of many gradient decent based
algorithms[4].The step size should scale inversely with the Lipschitz contant. We can calculate the constant
by taking the eigenvalue of the hessian matrix of See 5.1 to see code

3.4 Adding Mobility and Location Variable
After checking the accuracy of our model tting process, we would calculate infection rates for all the
counties. Then we want to better predict the case numbers with more data: mobility and geographic
information. Using Geographical Information And Mobility Data to Predict County Infection are necessary
for improving the accuracy of our model. In order to nd nearby counties, We used data provided by US
Census to nd out each counties' neighbors. In order to achieve a more accurate prediction, the direction of
mobility is necessary. Therefore, we initially set out four closest counties in west-north-east-south direction.

3.5 Accuracy
After getting the andD, we want to plug in these two values into an ODE model to check whether this
model can predicts infection numbers of that specic region. In theory, the curve of the ODE model should
t our training data.

At US country level (gure 6), the model is underestimating the number of cases. At state and county
level (Figure 7 and Figure 3), the model performs well predicting the number of cases.
5 Discussion
5.1 Reason For Inaccurate Predictions on Certain Counties
Fitted Epidemiology Models' predictions are either overestimating or underestimating. The predictions are
o because we are isolating the state from neighboring states, county from neighboring counties; there are
constant transmissions between neighboring regions.
We want to add another variable into our Epidemiology model, the mobility, how fast are people in an
area changing locations, which can be obtained from the mobility data-set at county level. This part will be
incorporated in Winter quarter.
Later we tried on a auto supervised learning model to see what we could learn from the performance from
the such model. However, because of the limitation of the time series data set, it failed to predict the data of
the later time after training on the earlier data set .
From the map above, we can see that the counties we have really ""inaccurate"" predictions are Imperial
County, Amadar County, Shasta County and Trinity County. The missing data for neighboring counties in
Arizona for the counties on edges/corners and low population can explain away some of the inaccuracy in
predictions for these counties.
Another issue needs to be investigated is the positive or negative percent dierence between actual cases
6and predicting cases of California on 3/2/2021.
5.2 Training Spatial Model For Better Beta and D estimation
Right now, the andDare derived from the implementation of Epidemiology Model itself, with out spatial
dynamics. However, for future research, andDcan be learned through Gradient Descent method in the
temporal-spatial model.
We would want to minimize the loss function, by setting the derivative of the loss function to zero and
solve the function to nd the , D and c to minimize the loss function.

12","The paper discusses the spatial-temporal prediction of COVID-19 case counts through an epidemiology model. The problem is to forecast the number of cases in order to allocate resources and understand the impact of protocols such as stay-at-home orders. The data used includes confirmed, death, and recovered cases from JHU's public COVID-19 GitHub repository, as well as mobility data from Descarted Lab. The methods involve using gradient descent to find infection rate and duration, inferring parameters, determining learning rate, and adding mobility and location variables. The results show predictions for specific counties in California on March 2, 2021, with a comparison to actual case counts. Some counties have accurate predictions while others are over or underestimating. The paper discusses reasons for inaccurate predictions and suggests training a spatial model for better estimation of parameters."

Political Analysis of Senatorial Twitter Accounts
Using Graph Machine Learning
1. Introduction/Abstract
The modern American political landscape often seems
void of bipartisanship. Nowhere is
this stark divide between red and blue more evident
than in the halls of the US Capitol, where the
Senate and House of Representatives convene to carry
out the duties of the legislative branch.
While us average Americans rarely watch the daily
proceedings of the Senate or House, Twitter
has given us a unique window into the debates and
discourse that shape our democracy . In fact,
the 1 16th Congress, which served from January 3, 2019
to January 3, 2021 broke records by
tweeting a total of 2.3 million tweets! As such, it
is clear that Twitter is quickly becoming a
digital public forum for American politicians. This
surplus of tweets from the 1 16th Congress
enables us to analyze the Twitter (following-follower)
relationships between politicians on and
across the two sides of the aisle. This project’ s
main inquiry is into whether there is a tangible
difference in the way that Democrat members of Congress
speak and interact on social media in
comparison to Republican members of Congress. If there
are such dif ferences, this project will
leverage them to train a suitable ML  model on this
data for node classification. That is to say ,
this project aims to determine a Senator ’s political
affiliation based of f of a) their Twitter
relationships to other Senators b) their speech patterns,
and c) other mine-able features on
Twitter . In order to truly utilize the complex implicit
relationships hidden in the Twitter graph,we can use models such as Graph Convolutional Networks, which apply the concept of
“convolutions” from CNNs to a graph network-oriented
framework. These GCNs learn feature
representations for each node in the Twitter graph
and utilize those representations to fuel the
aforementioned node classification task. However useful
the GCN may be, there is no shortage
of other graph ML  techniques that could lend themselves
to the prediction task at hand. Of
particular interest are inductive graph ML  techniques;
inductive Graph Networks are a new
assortment of Graph Networks that no longer need to
be trained on a whole graph to get feature
representations for all nodes in the dataset (transductive).
Instead, inductive techniques like
GraphSage peer into the structural composition of
all the nodes in a graph by building
neighborhood embeddings for each node. By using a
medley of networks on this dataset, we gain
deeper insight into what kind of graph we are working
with. In other words, if more complex
techniques like GraphSage outrank vanilla GCNs, it
would point to an equally complex structural
composition within the graph that only an inductive
technique like GraphSage would be able to
pinpoint. However , it is harder to train any network
without features. In the case of our analysis,
these features will be some text embedding of a politician's
tweets. Solutions like word2vec or
even a sentiment analysis metric that aggregate across
the hundreds of thousands of tweets
posted by the 1 16th Congress could prove quite useful
as features for the training of the
aforementioned models.
2. Datasets and Data Gathering
a.
handles.csv
This dataset is a definitive mapping of each Senator ’s
Name,
(Twitter)
Handle,
and
Party
b.
edges.csvThis dataset records Senatorial relationships on Twitter . For example, if Senator AK Lisa
Murkowski followed UT  Mitt Romney , this would be represented as “UT  Mitt Romney” in the
followed
column and “AK Lisa Murkowski” in the
following
column. It has 3824 rows and 2
columns with two columns:
followed
and
following.
This data was gathered using the
PhantomBuster Social Media Scraping API. The original
dataset encompassed all Twitter
accounts that each of these Senators followed, but
this data was then filtered down to only
Senator -Senator relationships.
c.
tweets.csv
This dataset contains all Senatorial tweets during
the 1 16th Congress (January 3, 2019 to
January 3, 2021). It has 103428 rows and 3 columns
:
Senator Name, T weet, Date T weeted
This data was scraped using Twint, a python library
for scraping from Twitter .
d.
voting_data.csv
This dataset contains Senatorial voting patterns during
the 1 16th Congress. This dataset
contains the 79 bills that were issued by the Senate
during their two years in session. It has 7900
rows and 3 columns:
Senator Name, Decision, Bill.
Each row represents how each Senator voted
on a specific bill. There are four possible decisions
for their vote: “Y ea”, “Nay , “Not Voting”,
“Absent”. This data was scraped from
https://www .senate.gov
using the python library
beautifulsoup4.
e.
voting_feature.csv
This dataset is created by ordinally encoding each
of the aforementioned 4 possible votes
and then pivoting the voting_data.csv . In this dataset,
the bills being voted on represent the
columns and each row represents how each Senator voted
on each of the 79 bills. In total, it has
100 rows and 79 columns.3. Exploratory Data Analysis
Figure 1: The visualization of edges.csv
Above is a visualization of the graph network scraped
from Twitter . It is immediately apparent
that the two political parties (Democrats being in
blue, Republicans in red) are almost perfectly
separated when visualized. This represents the very
tangible divide that bifurcates the US Senate
both in Twitter and in their voting patterns, as we
will see later . We can also see that more far left
members of the Senate, such as Senator Bernie Sanders,
are in the bottom right of our graph.
Meanwhile, Senator Josh Hawley , a Senator who openly
supported the overturn of the 2020
presidential election is the red node in the upper
left of the Figure. In this way , we can see that
the graph network manages to convey not only the separation
of the two parties, but also the
alignments of some of these Senate members along the
political spectrum. That is to say , the
closer that a Senator is to the center of the graph, the more likely they are to be a political
moderate. This assumption is further supported by
an analysis of the closeness centrality of each
of the nodes. Closeness centrality is a representation
of how central a node is to a graph. More
accurately , it is a sum of the shortest lengths between
any node and the rest of the nodes in the
graph. The node with the highest centrality would
then represent the member of the Senate that is
most connected with the opposite political party .
In the case of the following network, the
highest closeness centrality belongs to Democrat Senator
Joe Manchin from West Virginia. This
data makes sense in the context of the events following
the inauguration of President Joe Biden,
during which Manchin has repeatedly struck down proposals
for a $15 minimum wage and
ending the Senate filibuster (both of which are widely
endorsed Democrat policies). Other
Democrats who recently voted against the $15 minimum
wage bill, such as Senator Mar garent
Hassan and Kyrsten Sinema, also have notably high
centrality , which implies the relation
between centrality and moderate political views. It
is also worth noting that the average
centrality of all Democrats (0.534007) is slightly
higher than that of all Republicans (0.520566),
implying that Democrats are more likely to interact
with Republicans than vice-versa.
Figure 2: Basic statistics for the graph network
The graph contains 3823 edges. The average in degree
and out degree for the graph is 38.2300.
4. Methods
So far , we have implemented GCN and GraphSage as our cornerstone models for this
project. The majority of the underlying codebase for
these models is sourced from Yimei’ s
previous team: Group 2. Here is a brief detailing
of how these two models work:
We wrote these models in dif ferent .py files. The
GCN model is in GCN_model.py and
GraphSage is in graphsage.py . Our data is loaded from
separate, or ganized files inside our
project git. Our models and methods have demonstrated
high performances for our classification
task.
a.
Data Loader
Our data is manually scraped from the internet, with
the only automated portion being the
scraping of Twitter follower -following relationships.
The details of the datasets are already
explained above. However , before we were capable of
using this data, a great deal of cleaning
was required to ensure that the Senator Names in all
three tables matched (i.e. Solving
discrepancies such as “Joe Manchin the III” vs. “Joe
Manchin”) in order to ensure we could use
names as a reliable primary key across all tables.
After such cleaning, we created the three key
tables listed above in a format suitable for quick
use. Therefore, our data loader function is solely
designed to load the datasets as is with minimal adulteration.
This data loader , which accepts two
file addresses as ar guments, loads the feature dataset
and edges dataset respectively . One is the
address of the feature dataset, and another is the
edges dataset. The current feature dataset
(Voting Data) contains the matrix, which has 100 rows
and 80 columns. The only
transformations are 1) changing the label set from
a categorical feature space to an ordinal
feature space and 2) transforming the edges into an
adjacency matrix. As such, the structure ofthe Data Loader is simple to use. We only need to call get_data(), so that the function will load
the feature set, the label set and the adjacency matrix.
b.
Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)
GCN is one of our major models of our project. The
model is constructed by inner layer
and outer layer , which are written in dif ferent classes.
These two layers are linear . In terms of the
n_hidden_GCN class which is the inner layer , it contains
multiple parameters: feature matrix,
labels, adjacency matrix, the shape of feature matrix,
number of hidden neurons, the weights on
self-loops on neighbors. We directly put our features
matrix, labels, and adjacency matrix into
the inner layer . Specifically , calling the n_hidden_GCN
class will generate the process of model
building. Inside the n_hidden_GCN class, we transform
our feature matrix to be the matrix
which is in  the shape of (N, number of hidden neurons).
This is how to incorporate our feature
matrix with hidden neurons. In terms of the adjacency
matrix, we normalize the adjacency matrix
by using self_weight. Self_weight is designed to add
weight on the ef fect of self-loops to balance
the neighbor ef fect. And this is how to normalize
the adjacency matrix. In terms of the outer
layer , we further transform our feature matrix to
the shape of (N, number of class). We also
multiply our X with the transformed version of the
adjacency matrix.
c. GraphSage
GraphSage is another model used in our project. One
important aspect of the GraphSage
is the aggregating functions in the model. In our
project, we only support the mean aggregator .
The aggregating function makes the model become a
good inductive node embedding tool. We
incorporated the node features into the learning model
to obtain multiple dimensions of the
graph, like information about the neighborhoods. In
terms of the mean aggregator , it is verysimilar to the convolutional propagation rule in the GCN model. Since the GraphSage can be
seen as an inductive version of the transductive GCN
algorithm, the general structure of the
GraphSage is similar to GCN model. In terms of the
hyper -parameters in the model, length of
random walk, the learning rate, and the number of
neighbors are essential for tuning in order to
get higher accuracy . The length of random walk indicates
the number of steps it might take in the
process of random walk. The number of neighbors is
the number of neighbors each step of
random walk reaches.
d. Bag of Words
We used the bag of words on tweets by senators as
our feature to do the predictive task.
We extracted all Tweets sent by 100 Senators during
the 1 16th Congress. We measure the
popularity of words in Tweets to convert the text
into a matrix. Since the total lexicon size of the
complete Tweet dataset, we only used the top 1000
frequent words as measurement. For each
senator , we combine all the tweets and check the frequency
of the 1000 most frequent words.
This is how to convert the text into the matrix. In
our project, we combine the bag of words
matrix and the voting record as features to build
the model. Therefore, for each Senator , there are
1079 features, which are composed of 1000 popular
words and 79 voting records. Below , we will
further analyze how dif ferent features might af fect
the accuracy of the models we used.
5. Results and hyper -parameters
a.
GCN
Figure3: The function call for the model and dif ferent hyperparameters for GCN model
Based on our dataset, A is the adjacency matrix from
the edges.csv . The features
parameter is the features dif ferent features that
we created based on analysis of text from Tweets
and voting patterns. The labels parameter represent
the political leaning of each senator , which is
either democrat or republican. The rest are hyper -parameters
that can be tuned to reach higher
accuracy . Since we have already explained the meaning
of these hyper -parameters in section 4.b,
we will not further clarify them. The above screenshot
shows hyper parameters we need to tune.
The following table shows dif ferent outcomes of the
model by dif ferent features and
hyper -parameters. If we use the numerical format of
the text and the voting records as features,
there will be 1079 features for each senator . After
tuning the hyper -parameters, we finally get the
accuracy of 96%, with 150 hidden neurons, 0.3 test
size, 200 training epochs and 1e-4 learning
rate. Apart from that, we also try to incorporate
analysis on tweets and voting records separately
into the model. We can see from the table that the
accuracy of only using analysis from tweets as
features is 83% and the accuracy for only using voting
records is 100%. The 100% accuracy is
because we extracted how 1 16th senators vote for the
bills. Apparently , it is too easy for the
model to learn, since the feature information is too
straightforward. Therefore, we decided to
combine 1000 text features and 79 voting records together .
This will lower the weight of
importance of voting records in our task, and at the
same time, the bag of words also has good
performance.

GraphSAGE
Figure6: The way to call the model and dif ferent hyperparameter
for GraphSAGE model
Similar to the GCN model, A, features, labels represent
the adjacency matrix, features
like bag of words of Tweets and voting patterns, and
political leaning of each senator
respectively . And we choose to use the mean aggregator
for the GraphSAGE model. Other
hyper -parameters like len_walk, learning rate, num_neigh
are introduced in the 4c section.
The following table shows dif ferent outcomes of the
model by dif ferent features and
hyper -parameters. If we use the numerical format of
the text and the voting records as features,
there will be 1079 features for each senator . After
tuning the hyper -parameters, we finally get the
accuracy of 96%, with 150 length of random walk, 8 number of neighbors, 0.3 test size, 200
training epochs and 1e-4 learning rate. And we also
try to use features that only contain the
voting patterns only . And we found that the result
accuracy is pretty good, and can get 100%
after tuning the parameter . The 100% accuracy is because
we extracted how 1 16th senators vote
for the bills. Similar logic as GCN, this is caused
by the factors being too straightforward and is
not that meaningful to use such factors. So we decide
to use combined features as our primary
sources.

6. Conclusion
In this paper , we predicted the senator's political
party based on dif ferent features like
Tweets sent by them, and voting pattern. We compared
the existing graph embedding methods
GCN and GraphSAGE by using similar node classification
approaches. For both methods, we
use dif ferent features to predict the output. The
GraphSAGE model outperformed the GCN
model in some runs and can provide us a relatively
stable result for combined features of bag of
word and voting patterns. And features using voting
patterns also outperformed comparing with
natural language processing on Tweets or combined
features. A lot of potential improvements is
possible for future work, such as extending the dataset,
creating better visualization for the
output, and extending the models to multimodal graphs.
A further improvement could also
include sentiment analysis of these tweets And one
constraint we meet in this project is data
extraction. If this barrier can be removed, not only
the senator's political party can be predicted,
we can also use the model to predict each individual's
political leaning. And this will definitely
be an interesting direction that can be worked with
in the future improvement.

3D Points Clouds Classification with Graph Neural Network
 
1.
Abstract
 
This research focuses on 3D shape classification. Our goal is to predict the category of
 
shapes consisting of 3D data points. We aim to implement Graph Neural Network models and
 
compare the performances with the PointNet, a popular architecture for 3d points cloud
 
classification tasks. Not only will we compare standard metrics such as accuracy and confusion
 
matrix, we will also explore the model's resilience on data transformation. What’s more, we tried
 
combining PointNet with graph pooling layers. Our experiment shows that even though PointNet
 
has a higher accuracy overall, GCN has much more reasonable misclassification and is much
 
more robust to data augmentation.
 
 
 
2.   Introduction
 
Currently, 3d data has been widely used in a lot of industries’ fields such as
 
automatic-driving, virtual-reality,  gesture recognition, etc. There are two major structures to
 
represent 3d data: the first one is 3d grids and the second one is 3d points cloud. 3d grids are
 
created based on 2d images. Instead of using a 2d array to represent the pixel values in the 2d
 
grid, the 3d grid uses a 3d array to represent ‘true/false’ or pixel value in a specific location.
 
Since the similarities between the data structure, lots of researchers tried to apply Convolutional
 
Neural Network which originally developed on images on 3D grids. There are lots of successful
 
works. However, 3d grid is not a memory-efficient data structure for storing 3d shapes, and thus
 3d CNN also wastes a lot of time/memory if used for predicting the 3d shapes. For example, we
 
now only have 4 points {(100, 100), (100, -100), (-100, 100), (-100, -100)} representing a cube
 
in 3d space. If we want to use 3d grids representing this shape, we need to create a 100*100*100
 
arrays for storing information and 99.99% of the memory used are waste.
 
 
The 3d points cloud is created to save 3d shapes which solves the problem that 3d grids
 
have. That is the reason why most of the 3d radar in the industry use this structure, and why it is
 
so important to have models that make predictions based on it. The 3d point cloud is just a set of
 
3d points where all points are like (x,y,z). A famous model for 3d points cloud data is PointNet.
 
It is used for shapes classification, objects segmentation, and scene segmentations. It is a model
 
which is designed directly based on the set of the 3d points. However, 3d points cloud could also
 
be seen as a graph. The nodes are the points and the edges represent the connection between
 
points. In this project, we aim to use Graph Convolutional Network to predict 3d shapes based on
 
3d point cloud data. We will compare our results with our baseline model - PointNet and we will
 
also try to combine graph layers and Pointnet.
 
 
In this report, the Data section will discuss the dataset we used. The Graph Construct
 
section will talk about how we construct graphs on points clouds. The Model section will discuss
 
the models’ architecture we designed, and finally the Result section will discuss the running
 
outcomes and performance of our models. We also provide links for the code and the website in
 
the appendix.
 
 
 
3.    Data
 
In this project, we will mainly use the ModelNet40 as our dataset. This dataset contains
 
40 categories such as airplane, TV_stand, guitar, etc. Each category has around 500 samples and
 every sample contains 3k-80k points. Points are all in the format of euclidean space coordinates
 
(x,y,z). The range of the coordinates is not unified and varied a lot. Some samples may have
 
points all in the range in (-100, -100, -100) to (100, 100, 100) while some may have (-4000,
 
-4000, -4000) to (4000, 4000, 4000). This difference could result in imbalance models’
 
parameters training and thus we used min-max normalization to normalize all points in all
 
samples to range (0, 0, 0) to (1, 1, 1). Not only could normalization help us train a balance
 
model, but also it will be convenient for us with the graph construction. Since the fix-radius
 
graph construction needs a unique hyper-parameter r, instead of finding a best choice of r for all
 
samples, we could simply use one number if we normalized our data first.
 
Sampling is also a key procedure. Samples with categories like air_plane, cars, or guitar
 
usually have 60k+ points. Using 60k+ points will construct a graph with 60k+ nodes and
 
600k-1200k+ edges. The data dimension is too big to train the model efficiently and at the same
 
time, increase the running time for data-loading and graph-construction. Not to mention that
 
most of the points are unnecessary in model’s training. In lots of cases, datasets include the inner
 
points, which do not contribute to the determination of the category’s shape. What is matter are
 
those surface points which construct the shape of the sample. In our project, we decide to
 
randomly select 1000 points for all samples. Some may doubt that the size may be too small
 
while our baseline model PointNet shows that 1000 points are indeed sufficient. What’s more,
 
since we regularize the number of points, we do find implementing the model's architecture more
 
easily since we have a unified input shape.
 
 
Below are three images of the raw data, the normalized data, and the sampled normalized
 
data. We could see that even after the sampling process, we still could clearly tell the object’s
 
shape.
 
  
Graph 3.1: Raw data; “Car”
 
 
Graph 3.2: Normalized data; “Car”
  
Graph 3.3: Normalized and Sampled data; ‘Car’
 
After models-training, we also tested our model’s performance on a different dataset
 
ShapeNet. ShapeNet is a public 3d points cloud data and shares a lot of the same categories with
 
ModelNet40. Through testing on samples that models have not seen in the training process, we
 
could measure our model’s elasticity.
 
Data augmentation is also used in this project to improve the accuracy and measure
 
models’ resilience. Our goal is to train models predicting the shape of a point cloud. Therefore, if
 
the incoming points: 1. Globally translate with one direction; 2. Rotate a certain angle; 3. Stretch
 
or squeeze with a degree in certain ranges, our model should be able to predict the same result. In
 
this project, normalization will help us deal with transformation and we used the data
 
augmentation testing the left two.
 
 
 
4. Graph Construct
 In order to train a Graph Neural Network, we need first convert our dataset into a
 
collection of graphs. To be more specific, we need an adjacency matrix or adjacency list to
 
represent the edges’ information. In this project, we used two different ways to construct the
 
graph. The first one is the fixed-radius distance. We calculated the euclidean distance between
 
each node and set a threshold. Any node that is farther away from one node than this distance
 
will not be considered as one’s neighbor. For nodes that are the range of this distance, we will
 
store the distance either by a distance matrix or an adjacency list. The second method is using
 
k-nearest-neighbors to find k most nearest neighbors of one node. Then storing either the
 
distance or simply binary information as a matrix or adjacency list. The advantage of using
 
fix-radius is that for different nodes, we can have different connection density. Thus we could
 
distinguish nodes' popularity. For example, a node with lots of neighbors may be located right in
 
the center of the shape while a node with few neighbors is in the corner. From the model's
 
training perspective, this could help us aggregate the node’s features' information. The features
 
of nodes with more neighbors will be aggregated more often and thus play a more important role.
 
The drawback of fix-radius is that the value of the hyper-parameter ‘r’ is hard to define.
 
Different r values could result in a highly different graph and thus affect our model’s result. In
 
general, a higher value of r could result in a more dense graph while a smaller number could
 
result in a more sparse one. In our model’s comparison process, we will compare our models’
 
performance on datasets generated by different r values. Below are images of graphs that are
 
constructed based on the same data points but with different r values.
  
Graph 4.1: Graph constructed with r = 0.1
 
 
Graph 4.2: Graph constructed with r = 0.2
  
Graph 4.3: Graph constructed with r = 0.3
 
The advantage of using k-nearest neighbors is that we could have the same neighbors for
 
all points thus we do need to worry about the hyper-parameter setting in-class
 
influence.However, it is also the drawback since we could no longer apply the connectivity of
 
one node to others in our models. We will use both methods to create datasets and train our
 
models on each one. The comparison results will be discussed in the Result section.
 
 
 
5. Models
 
In this section we will discuss models’ implementation details. Graph Convolution
 
Network (GCN) is our main focus. PointNet is used as a baseline model. Since it is only used for
 
comparison, we designed it simply and similar with our GCN’s architecture. In the last part, we
 
will discuss the effects of combining graph pooling layers with PointNet. All three models are
 
predicting on a points set. Thus, all models should be invariant to permutation. In other words, if
 
we change the order in which we pass in our data points, the predicting results should always be
 the same. Thus, maintaining this speciality is an important key in implementation of models. We
 
will discuss the permutation invariance of the three models in the corresponding section.
 
 
 
5.1 PointNet
 
PointNet is a well known model’s architecture and widely-used in 3d points data machine
 
learning tasks. It fully used the Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP) and symmetric functions to
 
maintain the model’s permutation invariance. More specifically, MLP is a layer that is trained to
 
learn a function for all the points. Letting 
be the function MLP learned. For all points, the

parameters

are all the same. Thus, set

functions such as max-pooling or mean-pooling will help us to reduce the data dimension while
 
at the same time still keep the permutation invariance. After multiple blocks of MLP and pooling
 
layer, we transform our data points to a feature vector and use them to predict the class labels.
 
When implementing the code, we choose to use the convolution 1d layer to represent the MLP
 
layer. The full architecture is shown below:
  
Graph 5.1: PointNet Architecture
 
PointNet is only used as a baseline model in our project. Thus we only keep its core
 
layers and design it simply. The architecture is similar to the architecture of our Graph
 
Convolutional Network. We also implemented a Graph-Pooling-PointNet model in which we
 
added two graph pooling layers between the MLPs to reduce the dimension. The full architecture
 
is shown below:
  
Graph 5.2: Graph-Pool Pointnet
 
 
5.2 Graph Convolutional Network
 
The core component of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is the graph convolutional
 
layer. Traditional convolutional computation is based on matrix-shape data. Compared with
 
traditional convolution, graph convolution computation is based on graph architecture, to be
 
more specific, the edges. Either through multiply with adjacency matrix or one-by-one
 
aggregating through edge list, graph convolution extracting features for a node from its
 
neighbors. Similar to what we did in PointNet, we first transform our features to higher
 
dimensions (3 to 32 and to 64) using GCN layer. Then by down-sampling through the graph
 
pooling layer, we reduce the sample size. After pooling, we again use GCN layer to transform
 
our features space back to the class-size dimension for predicting. The model is ended with a
 softmax function to calculate the probability for each category. The full architecture is shown
 
below.
 
Graph is indeed a permutation-invariant structure. No matter what order we passed in the
 
points, we will always construct the same graph. What’s more, GCN layer and graph pooling
 
layer are all based on graph architecture. Through connecte them with non-linear layers, our
 
GCN model should be permutation invariant as a whole.
 
 
 
Graph 5.3: GCN
 
 
5.3 Future Direction: GCN-PointNet
 
One further potential model architecture that may boost the accuracy is combining MLP
 
layer with graph aggregation. To be more precise, after MLP learns a function that transforms all
 
points through a same function with the same weights and bias, multiply the outcome with an
 
adjacency matrix and distance matrix that was created from the graph construction method. This
 model’s architecture combines the advantages of GCN layer and PointNet layer and we expect it
 
will have better performance. This model is still in the WIP state and we will update to our code
 
repository.
 
 
 
6. Results
 
In this section, we are going to: 1. Compare the accuracy and confusion matrix of GCN
 
and PointNet; 2. Discuss hyper-parameters’ effects. 3. Discuss the use of pooling layers. 4.
 
Discuss GCN and PointNet’s resilience on data augmentation.
 
 
6.1 GCN vs PointNet:
 
In our experiment, the best accuracy we found using GCN on 10 categories classification
 
is 57%±2.7%. The deviation is caused by the sampling difference happening in the graph
 
construction process and as well as the model’s initiation values. The parameters used for this
 
result is {‘pool’: SAG, ‘ratio’: 0.4, ‘val_size’: 0.2, ‘lr’: 5e-4, ‘epoch’:30, ‘batch_size’: 32}.
 
PointNet, on the other hand, got a best accuracy 68% on the same dataset. Training both two
 
models on transformed 40-categories data will both get a much worse result - GCN will have a
 
best accuracy of 27% and PointNet will have 45%. The reason is that we used 1000-points
 
sampling to build our training dataset while in some categories, most of the samples could not
 
meet this threshold and thus create a highly imbalanced dataset. In general, PointNet seems to
 
have a better accuracy overall. Looking at the accuracy curve given below, we could find that
 
both two models converge really fast. The accuracies will not change much after 10 epochs.
 
  
Graph 6.1: Accuracy
 
 
Accuracy is a major metric used in classification tasks but it could not show everything.
 
We also plot two confusion matrices for each model. Below we provide the plots of each
 
confusion matrix.
 
  
 
Graph 6.2: CF-GCN
  
Graph 6.3: CF-PointNet
 
Through the confusion matrix for GCN (Graph 6.2), we could see that: 1. GCN has a best
 
performance on ‘airplane’ and ‘chair’ while has a bad prediction on ‘bookshelf’, ‘toilet’, and
 
‘vase’; 2. GCN tends to misclassify ‘toilet’ and ‘vase’ as ‘chair’, and misclassify ‘bookshelf’ as
 
‘bed’; 3. The misclassification is not caused by the imbalance numbers of training samples. This
 
is because GCN predicts the ‘monitor’ which contains less samples pretty well while doing a bad
 
job on ‘toilet’ and ‘vase’. Both of them contain a farewell number of samples. 4. Taking a look at
 the misclassified samples of GCN, we can see that the misclassification is reasonable and related
 
to the shapes of the data.
 
 
 
        
​
Original: Toilet; Predict: Chair                      Original: Vase; Predict: Chair                   Original: Bookshelf; Predict: Bed
 
Graph 6.4: Shapes
 
On the other hand, the confusion matrix for PointNet (Graph 6.3) shows that: 1.PointNet
 
predicts all 8 classes very well except the ‘chair’ and ‘monitor’. 2. PointNet tends to misclassify
 
‘monitor’ as ‘airplane’. In the training dataset, ‘airplane’ has the second most training samples
 
and ‘monitor’ has the third least training samples. This shows that PointNet’s misclassification is
 
more related to the number of samples instead of the shape itself. We could also see from Graph
 
6.5 that it is hard to tell that ‘airplane’ is similar with ‘monitor’.
 
 
 
 
Graph 6.5: Airplane and Monitor
 Putting it all together, we found that in general PointNet has a better accuracy than GCN
 
while GCN’s misclassification is more reasonable and more fit with the shape’s similarity. We
 
expect that if training on a more decent and large dataset, GCN could perform better than the
 
PointNet.
 
 
6.2 Hyper-parameters:
 
In this project, we used brute force to search the best parameters’ combination. Due to the
 
hardware and time limitations, we searched in a small range. However, we could still see some
 
general trends from the result.
 
The most significant parameter which affects the results a lot is which pooling layer to
 
use and the ratio used in the pooling layer. In this project, we tried SAG (Self-Attention Graph)
 
pooling layer and ASA (Adaptive Structure Aware) pooling layer. Both pooling layers are based
 
on graph architecture and they both use a hidden Graph Convolutional Layer (GCL) for scoring.
 
The difference is that SAG used GCL to score the importance of nodes within a cluster while
 
ASA used GCL to score the clusters. In other words, SAG is pooling nodes through all clusters
 
while ASA is pooling clusters. You can find two corresponding papers in the appendix section.
 
Our experiment shows that in our task, SAG pooling has a much better performance than ASA
 
pooling. From the graph 6.6, we could see that almost every combination using SAGPooling
 
performed better than ASAPooling. Also, the right graph shows that SAGPooling in general has
 
a 10% higher max-accuracy.
  
 
Graph 6.6: Pooling Layer
 
The parameter ‘ratio’ used in the pooling layer also plays an important role. In our
 
experiments, the result shows that compared with a slight larger pooling ratio (0.6 means after
 
pooling, the data size will be 0.6 of the original), a smaller ratio (0.4) could have a better
 
accuracy. This is shown through Graph 6.7.
 
 
 
Graph 6.7: Ratio
 
We also tried different settings of traditional hyper-parameters in deep learning such as
 
learning rate and batch size. It turns out that learning rate does not have much effect on final
 
results as long as it is smaller than 1e-3. Batch size, on the other hand, though did not have much
 
influence on the best accuracy, it has effects on the efficiency. In Graph 6.8, we could see that
 
with a larger batch size, the model converges much faster and reaches its best accuracy a few
 epochs before small batch size. This is reasonable since with a larger batch size, we updated our
 
weights with a larger batch data and thus have a more efficient training procedure.
 
 
 
Graph 6.8: Batch size
 
The last thing we want to talk about is the graph construct methods. We talked about two
 
graph construct methods fix_radius and KNN in the graph construction part. We tried four
 
different hyper-parameter settings (k and r) for each method. Through Graph 6.9, we could see
 
that KNN is generally better than the fix_raius. The reason, from our perspective, is that KNN
 
will construct a more balanced graph which basically will have zero disconnected nodes and
 
every node will have an equal number of edges.
 
  
Graph 6.9: Graph Construct
 
 
6.3 Pooling layers
 
In the model section, we mentioned that we will also train a Graph-Pooling-PointNet
 
model. However, this model has the worst result. The best accuracy is about 24% on
 
10-categories dataset. The reason why graph pooling works on GCN but not on pointnet is that
 
GCN model used graph convolutional layers ahead of graph pooling layers. The graph
 
convolutional layer will aggregate the information within a neighborhood/cluster. Thus when the
 
SAG pooling layer pools out nodes that are considered as less significant nodes in the cluster,
 their information will maintain in their neighbors. In other words, connecting graph
 
convolutional layers with graph pooling layers will not lose much information while at the same
 
time, reduce the sample size. However, MLPs in pointnet do not aggregate information within a
 
cluster. Thus, if we connect MLPs with graph pooling layers, we actually lose every nodes’
 
information we pool out. This also explains why the SAGpooling layer has a better result than
 
the ASApooling layer in our project. The reason is that the graph convolutional layer and the
 
SAGpooling layer make up for each other and have really good results.
 
 
The following graph shows the pooling results after the pooling layer.
 
 
Graph 6.10: Original-First Pooing-Second Pooling; Points
 
 
Graph 6.11: Original-First Pooing-Second Pooling; Graphs
 
 
6.4  Resistance on data augmentation
 
 Our models are trained to predict the shapes. Despite the permutation-invariance we
 
talked before, a good model should also be invariant to different data transformations such as
 
enlarge, shrink, and translation. In our project, we tried three different data augmentations and
 
used them to test GCN and PointNet’s resistance. The results is shown in the below table:
 
 
Table 6.1: Augmentation
 
We could see that PointNet has a much worse resistance than GCN. If the data is
 
stretched or shrunk, the pointnet will no longer recognize it anymore. On the other hand, GCN
 
model even did really badly on shrunk data, it did really well on translated data. The stretch
 
procedure is done by multiplying the original data with 100, the shrink procedure is done by
 
multiplying 1e-2, and the translate procedure is done though adding 0.1 to all points within a
 
sample. Three transformations could be seen through the following graph.
  
Top Left: Original; Top Right: Shrink;
 
Bottom Left: Enlarge; Bottom Right: Translate
 
7. Conclusion
 
All in all, our project shows that: 1. In general, PointNet has 11% higher accuracy than
 
GCN on ModelNet data. 2. GCN has more reasonable misclassification. 3. Pooling layers work
 
well in GCN while not in pointnet. The reason is graph convolutional layers make up the loss
 
information. 4. GCN has a much more robust resistance on data augmentation.

 ","This research focuses on 3D shape classification using Graph Neural Network models. The goal is to predict the category of shapes consisting of 3D data points. The performance of these models is compared with PointNet, a popular architecture for 3D points cloud classification tasks. The study also explores the resilience of the models to data transformation and combines PointNet with graph pooling layers. The experiment shows that while PointNet has higher overall accuracy, GCN has more reasonable misclassification and is more robust to data augmentation. The dataset used is ModelNet40, which contains 40 categories with each category having around 500 samples. The data is normalized and sampled to improve training efficiency. Two graph construction methods, fixed-radius distance and k-nearest neighbors, are used to create graphs for training the models. The models implemented include PointNet, GCN, and a combination of MLP layer with graph aggregation (GCN-PointNet). Results show that PointNet has higher accuracy but GCN has more reasonable misclassification. Hyper-parameter tuning reveals that SAG pooling performs better than ASAPooling and a smaller pooling ratio improves accuracy. Data augmentation experiments show that GCN is more resistant to transformations compared to PointNet. Overall, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of Graph Neural Networks for 3D shape classification tasks and highlights the advantages and limitations of different model architectures and techniques."

Graph-Based Product Recommendation
Abstract
Recommender
systems
are
important,
revenue-generating
technologies
in
many
of
the
services
today ,
providing
recommendations
for
social,
product,
and
other
networks.
However ,
the
majority
of
existing
recommender
system
methods
use
metrics
of
similarity
to
recommend
other
nodes
through
content-based
and
collaborative
filtering
approaches,
which
do
not
take
into
account
the
graph
structure
of
the
relationships
between
the
nodes.
A
graph-based
recommender
system
then
is
able
to
utilize
graph
relationships
to
improve
node
embeddings
for
recommendation
in
a
way
that
conventional
recommender
systems
cannot.
Inspired
by
GraphSAGE
[3]
and
PinSage
[1]
,
we
explore
two
unsupervised
graph-based
approaches
on
the
Amazon-Electronics
dataset
that
can
utilize
the
graph
relationships
of
product
and
user
data
in
order to generate accurate and robust embeddings for
product recommendation.
Intr oduction
Recommender
systems
are
responsible
for
large
revenues
and
consumer
satisfaction
in
many
of
the
services
used
today .
Widely-used
services,
such
as
Netflix,
Facebook,
Amazon,
and
LinkedIn,
use
recommender
systems
to
suggest
movies,
posts,
users,
and
products
to
their
consumers.
Traditional
recommender
system
methods
use
metrics
of
similarity
to
recommendother
products
through
content-based
and
collaborative
filtering
approaches.
However ,
product
data
can
be
expressed
in
a
non-Euclidean
graph
format
with
relationships,
such
as
products
bought
together
or
products
viewed
together .
Traditional
recommender
system
methods
do
not
take
into
account
the
graph
relationships
between
the
product
nodes
in
the
same
way
graph
neural
networks
do.
A
graph-based
approach
to
product
recommendation
is
able
to
fully
utilize
the
relationships
between
product
nodes
to
produce
improved
product
embeddings
that
can
represent the graph structures of product data.
Motivation
Recommender
systems
play
a
large
role
in
suggesting
products
in
online
marketplaces
or
connections
on
social
media
networks.
High
quality
recommendations
are
important
to
increase
consumer
satisfaction
and
boost
sales
revenues
and
user
interactions.
The
motivation
behind
our
project
is
to
apply
graph
neural
networks
to
the
complex
and
important
task
of
recommender
systems.
Though
traditional
recommender
system
approaches
take
into
account
product
features
and
user
reviews,
traditional
methods
do
not
address
the
inherent
graph
structure
between
products and users or between products themselves.

the

in
applying

to
work
in
an
unsupervised

context
to
generate
Amazon product embeddings, which take into account
the underlying graph structure.
Data
We
use
the
Amazon

from
Professor
Julian
McAuley .
We
use
the
Electronics
product
metadata
dataset,
Electronics
5-core

and
the

Electronics
product
image

The
5-core
reviews
dataset
represents
a
subset
of
Electronics
product
reviews,
in
which
every
product
has
at
least
5
product

and
every

has
written
at
least
5

Each

has
a

In
the
product
metadata
dataset,
the
products
are
identified
by
their
unique
Amazon
standard
identification
numbers,
or
ASINs.
We
first
dropped
all
rows
with
missing
data.
Then
we
filtered
out
our
data
to
keep
products
that
have
related
products
specifically
‘also_bought’,
which
reveals
all
ASINs
of
products
that
were
purchased
along
that
specific
product.
These
‘also_bought’
products
describe
our
target
nodes
in
our
edge
list.
After
that,
we
removed
all
‘also_bought’
products
that
do
not
exist
in
our
dataset.
Then
through
the
category
column
we
manipulate
it
into
another
column
to
get
its
sub-category
or
specified
niche
to
then
have
a
label
for
our
product
nodes.
Because
our
ASINs/Product
IDs
are
strings,
we
cannot
enter
it
into
our
model,
so
then
we
mapped
all
ASINs
in
our
dataset
to
a
unique
integer .
Then
we
formed
our
edge
list.
After
that
we
used
a
TF-IDF
Vectorizer
to
vectorize
the
title
text
features
of
the
product
to
serve
as
the
sole
product
node
feature.
After
extracting
our
node
labels
(niche
category),
node
features
(product
title),
and
edge
list,
we
began
constructing
our
graph,
and
then
inputting
the
graph and graph features into our model.
We
then
created
a
graph
of
all
nodes
and

and
then
divided
the

We
did
a

10%
of
the

were
located
in
the

and
90%
of
the

were
located
in
the

We
did
this
so
our

can
learn

We
drop
the
‘reviewerName’,
‘reviewT ime’,

‘reviewT ext’
columns,
then
dropping
all

with

We
process
the

by
the

to
get
a

filling
in

Using
the

we
read
in
the

only
keeping
the

that
appear
in
our

creating
a
final

of

with
both

We
then
read
in
the

and
filter
both
the

and
reviews
with
the
final

Missing

are
imputed
using
the

mean. At each step of our model, our model learns
through calculating the dot product of both
the source and tar get node and then applying that
feature onto an edge. As we have both positive
and negative edges describing true and false co-purchased
relationships between products, we
compared both edges to our model through a Dot Predictor
to then calculated our total loss
through binary cross entropy loss.
PinSage Model
Figure 6. Diagram of PinSage Algorithm
The
second
model
is
based
on
PinSage
[1]
and
learns
to
generate
node
embeddings
using
visual
features,
textual
features,
other
product
features,
and
graph
features.
Visual
features
are
image
embeddings
generated
by
passing
product
images
through
a
deep
convolutional
neural
network
[4]
.
Textual
features
are
processed
using
Pytorch’ s
TorchT ext
library
to
create
vocabularies
used
in
training
Bag
of
Words
models.
The
PinSage
model
takes
in
a
heterogeneous,
bipartite
graph
connecting
user
nodes
to
product
nodes
through
reviews.
Similar
to
the
GraphSAGE
algorithm,
the
PinSage
model
aggregates
neighboring
node
features
using
an
element-wise
aggregation
function,
concatenates
the
aggregated
neighborhood
representation
to
the
node’ s
current
representation
before
passing
the
entire
vector
through
a
neural
network
layer
and
normalized
to
get
a
final
representation.
This
final
node
embedding
represents
both
the
node
itself and its local graph neighborhood.
Figure 7. PinSage Embedding Algorithm
Unlike
the
GraphSAGE
algorithm,
PinSage
determines
which
neighboring
nodes
are
best
used
for
aggregation
for
the
best
representation.
The
PinSage
sampler
constructs
node
neighborhoods
by
performing
multiple
random
walks,
keeping
track
of
which
neighboring
nodes
are
visited
most
often.
The
most
visited
neighbors
are
considered
more
important
for
aggregation.
This
method
allows
the
model
to
aggregate
neighboring
nodes
based
on
a
factor
of
importance in an aggregation process called ‘importance
pooling’.
Figure 8. PinSage Sampling and Embedding Algorithm
Though the PinSage model is a supervised model based
on Pinterest data with ground
truth edge labels, we adapted our model to an unsupervised
context, where the model predicts
whether two products are reviewed by the same user .
Additionally , we add product node and user
node IDs as features to create learnable embeddings
for each node. However , this makes the
model transductive and can be excluded for inductive
applications.
We train the PinSage model using 10 random walks of
length 2 with a restart probability
of 50%. The model aggregates the top 3 neighboring
nodes, from 2 dif ferent SAGE
convolutional layers, to generate 64-length product
embeddings. The model was first trained for
200 epochs of 1024 batches per epoch at 32 batch size
and 3e-5 learning rate. Then it was trained
for 40 epochs of 5000 batches per epoch at 64 batch
size and 5e-4 learning rate.
Near est Neighbor Pr oduct Recommendation
By
combining
the
embedding
approaches
of
visual,
textual,
and
graph
features,
our
graph-based
approaches
can
generate
a
more
complete
and
robust
embedding
of
each
product.
To
generate
recommendations
given
a
product,
the
product
will
first
be
fed
through
the
model
to
generate
an
embedding.
Using
K-nearest
neighbor
methods,
we
find
the
closest
embedded
nodes
based
on
Euclidean
distance.
The
closest
node
embeddings
to
the
given
product
embedding
are
the
most
related
products.
The
K-closest
node
indices
are
then
converted
into
product
ASINs
for
recommendation.
Results
To evaluate the product recommendations of our models,
we used a metric called hit rate
for the top-K recommended products using K = 500.
Given an unseen product, the GraphSAGE
model generates the top-K closest embedded product
nodes to recommend. If at least one of the
recommended products is connected to the unseen product,
it is considered a hit. We calculate
the hit rate at K as the number of hits over the number
of unseen test products. Similarly , the
PinSage model generates the top-K closest embedded
product nodes to recommend for each user .
If at least one of the recommended products is reviewed
by the user in the test matrix, it is
considered a hit. We calculate the hit rate at K as
the number of hits over the number of users.

Discussion
Given the metrics of hit rate and loss, the unsupervised
GraphSAGE model slightly
performed better than the unsupervised PinSage model.
Though the results are not ‘state of the
art’, our results show us that product recommendation
can be accomplished using graph neural
networks. A reason the GraphSAGE model performs better
than the PinSage model can be
explained by the dif ferent product graphs used. Products
bought together may be more helpful in
product recommendation than products reviewed by the
same user because a user may review
many , completely dif ferent products that may not be
helpful for product recommendation.
Conclusion
We showed how graph convolutional networks can be
used in a recommender system
context and utilize graph data in addition to the
features considered by traditional approaches to
product recommendation. Using the Amazon Electronics
datasets, we explored two dif ferent
graphs and graph neural networks that can be used
for product recommendation. In one method,
we constructed a homogenous product graph with edges
between products bought together and
used an unsupervised GraphSAGE model. In another method,
we constructed a bipartite,
heterogeneous user -product graph with edges between
users and products they reviewed using an
unsupervised PinSage model. The GraphSAGE model slightly
outperformed the PinSage model,
but both models can be improved upon, as we did not achieve the results we had hoped for .
Future considerations may be to collect user features
or utilize more product features and review
features, such as product description, review text,
product brand, product category . Another
consideration is to utilize both product-product edges
and user -product edges in a unified graph
neural network model.

Project Pr oposal
Problem & Data
This
project
is
to
examine
recommender
systems
using
a
graph-based
learning
approach.
Recommender
systems
are
responsible
for
large
revenues
and
consumer
satisfaction
in
many
of
the
services
used
today .
Widely-used
services,
such
as
Netflix,
Facebook,
Amazon,
and
LinkedIn.
use
recommender
systems
to
suggest
movies,
posts,
users,
and
products
to
theirconsumers.
This
project
focuses
on
the
application
of
graph
learning
to
augment
product
recommendation.
Current
recommender
system
methods
use
metrics
of
similarity
to
recommend
other
products
through
content-based
and
collaborative
filtering
methods.
However ,
product
data
can
be
expressed
in
a
non-Euclidean
graph
format
with
relationships,
such
as
products
bought
together
or
products
in
similar
categories.
These
recommender
system
methods
do
not
take
into
account
the
relationships
between
the
product
nodes,
not
utilizing
the
graph
structure
of
data
to
improve
recommendations.
Graph-based
learning
can
take
advantage
of
the
relationships
between
product
nodes,
in
addition
to
the
product
text
and
image
features,
and
generate
more
accurate
and
robust
embeddings.
A
graph-based
recommender
system
then
is
able
to
utilize
improved
product
embeddings
to
recommend
products, utilizing graph data in a way that conventional
recommender systems cannot.
The
dataset
used
in
the
project
will
be
the
Amazon
Product
Reviews
dataset
from
Professor
Julian
McAuley
(https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html).
Each
product
has
image
and
CNN
features
that
can
be
used
as
node
features,
and
edges
are
provided
or
can
be
generated
using
spectral
clustering
techniques.
Edges
between
product
nodes
are
expressed
by
products
that
were
also
viewed
or
bought
by
users.
The
image
data
can
also
be
passed
through
a
CNN
to
generate
an
image
embedding
that
can
also
be
used
as
a
feature
in
graph
learning.
Once
we’ve
developed
a
graph
recommender
algorithm
for
Amazon
products
we
may
potentially
get
into
graph
classifications
concentrating
on
the
Amazon
user
and
their
features.
For
example,
our
dataset
contains
product
review
data
which
contains
data
on
both
the
product
and
the
user.
We
could
use
this
data
with
minor
data
ingestion
and
processing
techniques
to
create
nodes
on
users
with
node
features
such
as
products
reviewed,
productsviewed,
and
etc.
We
can
use
this
data
to
find
and
categorize
different
users
by
their
niche
interests
through
these
different
node
features.
In
this
case
we’d
be
creating
an
algorithm
similar
to
graph
classifications
on
social
media
networks,
but
on
Amazon
customers
and
their
products. Which would be a unique approach to user
graph classifications.
Methods
The
images
are
provided
within
the
dataset
as
URLs,
the
descriptions
and
other
text
features
are
also
provided
in
the
dataset,
and
the
graph
relationships
between
nodes
will
be
constructed
from
the
provided
IDs
of
products
also
bought
or
viewed
by
similar
users.
We
plan
to
utilize
a
convolutional
neural
network
to
generate
an
image
feature
embedding
from
the
product
image,
a
neural
network
model
like
word2vec
to
generate
a
text
feature
embedding,
and
a
graph
neural
network
like
graphSAGE
or
node2vec
to
generate
graph
embeddings.
By
combining
all
three
embedding
approaches,
we
can
get
a
more
complete
and
robust
embedding
of
the
product
for
recommendation.
The
closest
embeddings
to
the
generated embedding will be the most related products
and be recommended by model.
Project Output
The
output
of
the
project
will
be
a
report
that
describes
how
graph-based
learning
approaches
can
be
used
with
recommender
systems
and
include
comparisons
with
the
various
recommender
system
approaches
on
benchmark
datasets.
The
report
will
include
examples
of
the
recommendations
across
models
given
the
same
product
input.
An
optional
website
output
can
focus
on
returning
the
images
of
the
top
recommended
products
within
the
dataset
based on product information that the user submits.","This project report explores the use of graph-based learning approaches in recommender systems. Traditional recommender systems use similarity metrics to recommend products, but they do not take into account the graph structure of the relationships between products. Graph-based recommender systems can utilize these relationships to generate more accurate and robust embeddings for product recommendation. The report discusses two unsupervised graph-based approaches, GraphSAGE and PinSage, applied to the Amazon-Electronics dataset. The models utilize graph relationships, product features, and user reviews to generate embeddings for product recommendation. The results show that the GraphSAGE model outperformed the PinSage model in terms of hit rate. Future considerations include incorporating user features and utilizing both product-product and user-product edges in a unified model."

","The NBA faces challenges in making accurate predictions due to the many variables that can affect a team's performance over the course of a season. This study aims to produce accurate predictions by leveraging the natural structure of the NBA league and previous player stats. The analysis begins by identifying players on each roster to create an aggregated stat for each team. The team's schedule is then used to learn the unique performance of a team against every other team. Two models, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and GraphSAGE, are implemented to predict NBA seedings. The GCN model is initialized with the number of nodes, hidden layers, and classes, while the GraphSAGE model creates batches of neighborhoods and aggregates information from these neighborhoods into a new feature matrix. The models are tested using data from previous NBA seasons and compared for accuracy."

Abstract
In this project, we aim to produce a tool that will be able to predict the stock
movement of a company. The output will be a binary output where it will indi-
cated whether we are bullish or bearish on a stock. In our pursuit of making this
tool, we will incorporate graph convolutional networks to take advantage of the
interconnected features of stocks.
1 Introduction
Stock markets are important aspects of many economies and investors are constantly looking for
the most successful companies from which to buy and the least successful companies whose shares
should be sold. Stock market prediction is a certainly lucrative domain to which machine learning
methods can be applied, and recent advancements in the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence are heavily
aiding this prediction. Powerful new types of neural network models called graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) can effectively learn from data contained within a network structure [1]. GCNs
facilitate ML approaches on graphs similarly to the way traditional CNNs conveniently operate on
structured data like images. Whereas before one might derive features from the graph’s inherent
properties and use those for a machine learning task, one now has access to powerful algorithms
that can learn directly from the graph itself. Stock markets consist of highly self-dependent data and
have an inherent network structure that can be appropriately exploited using these techniques.
Human analysts typically employ either fundamental or technical analysis to make their market
predictions. Fundamental analysis assesses companies’ rate of growth through compiled metrics
like a price-to-earnings ratio; if a company is perhaps overvalued, sell it, as its stock price may
likely drop soon. Technical analysis tries to predict stock market movement through trends and
solely concerns stock price information; how did a market behave previously, and when might it
repeat this behavior? While human analysts will not be replaced by machines just yet, stock markets
are driven by many different complicated sources of information and are becoming too complex for
a single investor to fully understand. For instance, the 2008 ﬁnancial crash, the current ﬁnancial
crisis fueled by the pandemic, and the recent mania caused by Reddit’s r/wallstreetbets demonstrate
the ways intricate societal interactions heavily inﬂuence the stock market [9]. This complexity
makes it difﬁcult as well as time consuming to predict stock prices using only handcrafted technical
indicators and previous market data. Stock markets are also well known to be very noisy sources of
data, so much so that there is theory that stock asset prices are actually random walks themselves
[10]. A competing theory called the efﬁcient market hypothesis posits that markets actively reﬂect
all current information, and no knowledge about companies can yield a long-term advantage over
other investors [11]. Despite this seemingly difﬁcult task, several machine learning methods have
been employed to solve this problem.
Stock market prediction can be divided into two categories: price prediction and movement pre-
diction. Price prediction is a regression problem where a real number is predicted for each stock at
each day, while movement prediction is a binary classiﬁcation problem predicting whether a stock
moves up or down on each day. Movement prediction is more feasible than price prediction and is
the task on which we shall focus for this project.
1Previous approaches to this task use statistical models like ARIMA to make time series pre-
dictions, and traditional machine learning algorithms like logistic regression and support vector
machines were also utilized for classiﬁcation; more recent approaches use graph convolutional net-
works followed by a form of recurrent neural network, useful to model sequential data, to make
predictions [2].
2 Related Work
There exists multiple ways to construct a graph for the model based on stock data. A knowledge
graph can be constructed using extrinsic data about the stock market that models the type of knowl-
edge a professional investor might use in making predictions [2]. For example, one could make an
industry graph where the edges are 1 if the companies represented by the nodes are in the same in-
dustry and 0 otherwise. Ye et al. construct three knowledge graphs based on industry, shareholding,
and topicality information to incorporate relationships between companies in their model using a
GCN to learn informative features for corporations followed by a GRU that helps model the tem-
poral dependencies in the predictions [3]. Their methodology allows them to incorporate multiple
graphs and sources of information at once into their model for prediction. However, this involves the
collection of speciﬁc data that is not necessarily publicly available or easy to collect, so we forego
this approach in favor of using a correlation graph. The interdependence of the stock price move-
ments allows one to examine the cross correlation between the time series data and connect an edge
between two companies if the correlation exceeds a threshold value and provides a method to create
a graph modeling the stock market with more freely available and collectable stock price data [4, 5].
3 Methods
In order to model the stocks as a set of nodes and edges between them in a network, we construct a
graph based on the cross correlation between the time series data we collect for each stock’s closing
price. We deﬁne the cross correlation cijbetween stock price time series xiandxjas follows where
tranges from day 0 to day N-1:
cij=P
t[(xi(t) xi)(xj(t) xj)]pP
t(xi(t) xi)2pP
t(xj(t) xj)2(1)
wherexiandxjare the average values of the time series, and which corresponds to the sample
Pearson correlation coefﬁcient from our data [5]. An edge is formed between two stocks if their
correlation exceeds a threshold value, and after some experimentation on the effects the threshold
has on the sparsity of the graph, we use a threshold value of 0.4, which gives an average node degree
of about 5 [4].
Aij=
1;ifcij>0:4
0;otherwise(2)
Making one correlation graph over the entire period our data stretches could result in capturing
spurious correlations, so we difference the time series data once to get its increments ( Xt=St 
St 1) and apply a logarithm ( X0
t=log(Xt)) to reduce the effect of variance [4].
We use a graph convolutional neural network to make daily predictions on our data. The adjacency
matrix used in the GCN is usually preprocessed by adding an identity matrix to it to ensure that a
node’s own features are being included in the aggregation that becomes its features in the next
iteration; however, since each stock has perfect correlation with itself, the main diagonal of the
adjacency matrix of our correlation graph is guaranteed to be all ones and already contains self-
loops [1]. The representation of the graph is then normalized using the equation
^A=D 1=2AD 1=2(3)
where D is the diagonal node degree matrix of A [1]. Each day has four features (opening, low, and
high price, and trading amount), and stock movement on day iis predicted from these features from
the pastpdays, where p, a lag variable, is usually set to 5 as there are that many trading days within
a week. Therefore, our feature matrix Xis2Rn4pwherenis the number of stocks. Our target
labelsYare 1 if closing price is greater than that day’s opening price, and 0 otherwise. Two graph
2Figure 1: Graph of average node degree vs threshold
convolutional layers are used, followed by a fully connected layer, to obtain the probability of stock
increase for each stock on a particular day.
H(i+1)=(^AH(i)W);
H(0)=X;
^Y=(H(2)W)(4)
The network is trained using binary cross-entropy loss for 100 epochs using a learning rate of .001,
number of hidden units of 32, and Adam as the optimizer after some hyperparameter tuning. We
adapted Thomas Kipf’s Pytorch implementation of graph convolutional networks for our vanilla
GCN model [8].
4 Data
For this project, we collected stock price data from the 30 stocks that comprise the Dow Jones
Market Index over a 12-month period (127 trading days) ranging from January 2020 to January 2021
using Yahoo Finance’s API. We chose this data because we did not want to compare pre-pandemic
stock prices to post-pandemic prices, as market conditions varied drastically due to the pandemic,
but we still wanted to work with as much data as we possibly could given this constraint. Our model
features consist of opening price, low price, high price, and trading amount. The features are min-
max normalized to deal with discrepancies of scale between stock price (in the 100s) and trading
amount (in the 10000s). Our labels for each day will be 1 if closing price is greater than that day’s
opening price and 0 otherwise. We split the data into a 70-30 train-test split for prediction.

5 Results
We compare the results of our model using graph convolutional networks to two baseline models,
an ARIMA model and a fully connected network that does not incorporate a graph trained on the
same combination of hyperparameters as the GCN [7]. The ARIMA model performs well at 60%
accuracy over the test set. The fully connected network performs similarly to the GCN at 60%,
perhaps because our original graph was not of very good quality and doesn’t add too much to our
models’ ability to predict stock movement. This is also accuracy averaged over the days and stocks
4in our test set, and the average varied greatly between them. There may be certain days that have
harder prediction tasks than others.

6 Conclusion
Although our models performed similarly, we show that graph convolutional networks are one
method through which one can predict how stock markets move. If we had access to a better graph
than a correlation graph and more data over more stocks, the graph convolutional network would
perhaps use that to outperform the other two approaches.

1 Abstract
For our research on Political Popularity of Mis-
information, we want to research the inﬂuence
politicians have on Twitter, a well known social

ter that we are interested in will be grouped into
scientiﬁc information or misinformation. Politi-
cians can easily sway public opinion with a simple
tweet, therefore we wanted to analyze how much
they inﬂuence other Twitter users.
We gathered ten politicians who we considered

politicians who we considered to spread misinfor-
mation on Twitter. We analyze the two groups to
show how controversial a tweet appears. We do
this by looking at tweet engagement as well as a
popularity metrics to see growth over time.
The results of our investigation showed that
politicians who spread misinformation have a
higher ratio value on average and have less over-
all likes over their tweets. Our permutation tests
shows that our scientiﬁc group has been consis-
tentlygrowingandincreasingingrowthovertime.
In contrast, our misinformation group has grown
signiﬁcantly, but only in the more recent years.
Overall, our results show that a politician can ex-
perience the most growth through spreading non-
controversial, scientiﬁc information.2 Introduction

the retweets, likes, and comments of a speciﬁc

we used permutation tests in order to compare
our two sample groups to draw conclusions.

3 Data Collection
Our data consists of a collection of tweets for
each individual politician, also known as their
timeline. We obtain the tweet IDs that compose
our politicians’ timeline from George Washington
University’s TweetSets database. The TweetSets
database have datasets consisting of tweets for
research and archival purposes, covering a wide
range of topics such as climate change, the 2018
WinterOlympics,thetwomostrecentpresidential
elections as well as tweets made by politicians of
the 115th and 116th Congress.
Forouranalysis,wechosetofocusonpoliticians

resentatives of the 116th Congress and Congress:

datasets combined contain 2,756,042 tweet IDs
andwerecollectedbetweenJanuary27,2019and
May 7, 2020 from Twitter’s API using Social Feed
Manager. [2] The earliest tweet in this dataset
relevant to our project occurred on December 16,
2008 while the last tweet was made on May 5,
2020. It is worth noting that not all of the politi-
cians have tweets spanning all years. This is a
resultofsomepoliticianshavingjustbeenrecently
elected to Congress, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez whose ﬁrst term was the 116th Congress.
To start our data collection process, we ﬁrst
identiﬁed twenty politicians, ten of which we be-
lieve to spread misinformation during their time
in oﬃce and ten which we believe to spread sci-
entiﬁc information. In order to classify a politi-
cian as someone who spreads misinformation we
researched notable current politicians and justi-
ﬁed their classiﬁcation through reports and news
articles detailing their statements on topics rang-
ing from the coronavirus to the most recent elec-
tion. [3][4]Forexample,SenatorJoniErnst,who
falselyclaimedthathealthcareprovidersareinﬂat-
ing the number of coronavirus cases, or Represen-
tative Matt Gaetz, who falsely claimed that Antifa
members were part of the riots on Capitol Hill.
To classify a politician as scientiﬁc we identiﬁed
current politicians who often tweet out scientiﬁc
information such as Representative Lauren Under-
wood, a former nurse who regularly tweets and
retweets information about the coronavirus.
After identifying our politicians, we gathered
the user IDs for their Twitter accounts using an
onlinePythonlibraryTweepy,whichwethenused
toquerythetwoCongressionaldatasets. Weusea
politician’s user ID as opposed to their username
because a politician’s username may change over
time while their user ID remains constant. The
datasets also contain a ﬁle of the House and Sen-
atemembersalongwiththeiruserIDswhichisan
alternative way to obtain these IDs. To query the
datasets, for each politician, we selected either
the Representative or Senator dataset depending
on their position and inputted their user ID in the
“Contains any user id” box under the “Posted by”
section. This process gives us a text ﬁle of tweet
IDs for each politician which we then rehydrate
using Twarc which is a API used for accessing
archivedTwitterJSONdata. TheoutputisaJSON
ﬁle for each politician that contains tweet objects
returned by Twitter’s API. The average number of
tweets for our scientiﬁc politicians is 4,563 while
the average number of tweets for our misinforma-
tion politician is 5,446.
In order for us to calculate a tweet’s ratio, we
need to have information about the number of
times a tweet has been replied to. Unfortunately,
wearenotabletoaccessthereply_countattribute
on a Tweet object without the Premium or Enter-
prise tier of Twitter’s API. As an alternative, we
make cURL calls to the Twitter API’s Metrics ﬁeld,
which allows us to access engagement metrics for

4 Methods
For this section, we discuss the three diﬀerent
methods we use to analyze and draw conclusions
to our results. The three methods include the ra-
tio metric, popularity estimates, and permutation
tests.

a ratio metric. This method incorporates the num-
ber of likes, retweets, and comments a speciﬁed
tweet holds. We deﬁne an equation to measure
the amount of community engagement with the
given numbers from each tweet. A high ratio will
generally mean the Tweet has received a nega-
tive reaction whereas a low ratio would indicate
a positive or neutral reaction. We intend to track
the reaction of each tweet a politician tweets over
time to see the politician’s overall approval.
To analyze reception to a particular tweet, we
chose to use the concept of ratios or “getting
ratioed” on Twitter. This is the number of replies
compared to the number of likes and retweets a
tweet receives. Ratios allow for a quantitative
way to measure how controversial a tweet is, with
higher ratios signaling a more disputed tweet.

We decide to weigh comments negatively because
both the like and retweet function of a Tweet are
used as ways to indicate approval or agreement.
Althoughcommentscanalsocontainpositivefeed-
back, a large amount of comments compared to
a smaller number of likes and retweets generally
indicate that the Tweet was not well received.

for each politician in order to determine their av-
erage ratio. Each average ratio does not include
days where a politician does not tweet because
the ratio would result in an undeﬁned value since
the likes, comments, and retweets would be zero.
These tweets are removed from the other ratios in
order to prevent skewing of a politician’s average
ratio result.
4.1.1 Ratio Metric: Data Visualizations
In Figure 1, we graphed our ten politicians we
grouped as scientiﬁc. As we can see from the
graph, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney have the
highest ratios compared to our other eight politi-
cians grouped under scientiﬁc politicians. It is
interesting to note that these two politicians rep-
resent the Republican party, while our other eight
represent the Democratic Party.

diﬀerent way to estimate a politician’s following
andgrowth. Usingthelikesthatwegotfromeach
tweet for each politician, we created metrics as a
way to estimate the following that each politician
has and gains over time.
These metrics are tracked in two ways: over
time and over activity. Over time measures the
likes that a politician receives for each month. We
decided on the time frame of one month because
we believed that any smaller period of time would
not be a large enough time period to indicate any
signiﬁcantgrowthinfollowing. Overactivitymea-
sures the likes that each politician gets for each
tweet. It is important to note that the politicians
may have a diﬀerence in start date as well as a
diﬀerence in number of total tweets depending
on the frequency at which they Tweet at.
The metrics are further divided into either cu-
mulative or rolling. Cumulative builds on the pre-
vious amount of likes. This is useful to measure
the politician who generated the most following
to ﬁnd who may be the “most popular” politician.
Our rolling metrics take into account a period of
time or a number of tweets to aggregate on as a
way to see how popular politicians are at a given
moment of time while also taking into account
some recency. All rolling periods are trailing to
account for their recent tweets rather than future
ones.
Our rolling metrics can be split again into max
and average. Max will mark the max amount of
likes of a tweet over the trailing window. Aver-
age will take the average amount of likes for the
tweets over the window. The window size can be
adjusted for both our over time metrics and over
activity/tweets metrics.4.2.1 Popularity Metrics: Data Visualiza-
tions
For some graphs, the graphs analyze the likes of
tweets collected over time while others analyze
the likes collected over number of tweets. The
graphs showing tweets over time have a window
size of 4 months for their tweets. Depending on
the graph, the x-axis is tweets over time or total
number of tweets while the y-axis shows the av-
erage, max, or cumulative number of likes. Each
graph allows us to visualize trends and patterns
between each group. We are able to make inter-
esting ﬁndings between our two groups as well as
individuals.

had a much higher ratio trend for number of aver-

mation on Twitter.

4.3 Permutation Test
In order to actually see if the popularity of the
groups are changing over time, we run multiple
permutation tests. A permutation test takes in
two samples and determines the chance that
these samples come from the same population.
By running this test on our likes for our two
groups or politicians, we can see how similar in
popularity our groups are or if they are diﬀerent.
The distribution that we run our test on is the
normalized likes per year for both groups. Each
tweet’s likes in the current year that we are
looking at is subtracted and divided by the mean
likes of the previous year. This way we are able to
measure the growth rather than raw numbers.Our null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis
are as follows:
Null Hypothesis : The growth of likes for our
misinformation group is the same as the growth if
likes for our scientiﬁc group over each year.
Alternative Hypothesis : The growth of likes for our
misinformation group will be diﬀerent from our
scientiﬁc group over each year.
For this process, we normalize the growth of likes
foreachyearbycalculatingthepercentagegrowth
fromthe previous year. We run threemain permu-
tationteststodeterminecomparisonofgrowth. To
compare the scientiﬁc and misinformation groups,
we run a permutation test over each year compar-
ing the distribution of normalized likes for each
group. For example we compare Scientiﬁc 2015
vs Misinformation 2015 or Scientiﬁc 2016 vs Mis-
information 2016. This will allow us to see how
the growth of the two groups compare with each
other. After applying a Bonferroni correction due
to running multiple hypothesis tests which gives
an alpha of 0.05 / 8, we still ﬁnd that all years
show signiﬁcance except for 2017. This indicates
that the only year in which our scientiﬁc group
and misinformation group’s growth matched was
during 2017.
Figure 10: This graph shows our results for the scien-
tiﬁc versus misinformation groups for our
permutation test.
We then run two more permutation tests for
the two groups themselves. This test is on con-
secutive years and is meant to show us if growth
for each of the groups is increasing or stagnating.
ForexampleScientiﬁc2015vsScientiﬁc2016and
Misinformation 2015 vs Misinformation 2016.
For these tests, we ﬁnd that our scientiﬁc group
shows stagnated growth for the years 2013 to
2014. This indicates that the scientiﬁc group con-
sistently is growing more and more compared to
its previous years.
The misinformation group shows stagnated
years for 2013 to 2014, 2014 to 2015, and 2017
to 2018. Showing that they are not increasing in
following as often.

Figure 12: This graph shows our results for the misin-
formation group for our permutation test.
4.3.1 Permutation Test: Data Visualizations
For our permutation test data, we wanted to visu-
alize to see the growth over time as well as total
likes for each group. This allows us to see the
changes for each group from 2012 to 2020.
In graph 13, we compare our two groups by
analyzing the total number of likes per year. The
graphs indicate that our scientiﬁc group has sig-
niﬁcantly more total likes per year than our misin-
formation group. This has been a common trend
we see throughout our research.
Another important spike we see in our graphs
is in 2019. We can infer that there is a signiﬁcant
spike during this year because this is when the
COVID-19 pandemic started to be more spoken
about online. This pandemic was a major viral
disease which spread around the world, causing
many to become extremely ill. Our graph shows
that 2020 is much lower in total likes than 2019,
howeveritisimportanttonotethatour2020data

5 Results
As a result of our investigation, we found that
politicians who spread misinformation often have
ahigherratiovalueandlessoveralllikespertweet.
Thishigherratiovaluemeansthatthesepoliticians
are more likely to spread controversial informa-
tion on Twitter. This also shows that people who
are viewing their tweets on Twitter are engaging
in the politicians’ tweets by commenting more
compared to liking or retweeting.
In contrast, we see that politicians who spread
scientiﬁc information on Twitter have lower ra-
tios and signiﬁcantly more likes on their tweets.
This is interesting to note because it shows a clear

When comparing the two groups, we see that
our scientiﬁc group has been steadily increasing
ingrowthovertheyearswhileourmisinformation
group has only been growing signiﬁcantly in the
past recent years.
The overall result of our research shows that a
politician has the most growth through spreading
non-controversial, scientiﬁc information because
this yields a steady growth over time in compari-
son to spreading controversial information.
6 Conclusion
Twitter is one of the largest social media plat-
forms and as more politicians move to Twitter as
a means of sharing their political thoughts and
opinions, we see that their popularity and repu-
tation are strongly ampliﬁed. The digital world
can massively transform the growth of a politician
depending on the types of tweets they share.
Our ratio and popularity metrics show us that
a politician’s controversial tweets can heavily im-
pact their audience engagement. Scientiﬁc, non-
controversial tweets mainly spread by likes while
misinformation or controversial tweets spread by
havingmoreretweetsorcommentsaddressingthe
tweet.
The permutation test shows us that the growth
for politicians who share scientiﬁc information
has been more steady since they started tweeting,
whereas politicians sharing misinformation has
only recently started to see a rise in growth.
These distinct patterns show how a politician
can grow over time and the amount of inﬂuence
they have on their Twitter followers and audience
online.
The next envisioned steps of our analysis in-
clude collecting a larger sample size of politicians
in order to compare each politician to a larger
sample size. In addition to this, we would include
some former and current presidents such as Don-
aldTrumpandJoeBiden. Wemayalsoexpandon

Abstract:
Political tensions in the United States came to a
head in 2020 as the public responded to various major
events such as the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic
and the murder of George Floyd, as well as the 2020
presidential election. Here we investigate if there
is evidence of increasing polarization and negativity
in
regards to politics among the American public on social
media by analyzing Twitter data related to the
2016 and 2020 presidential elections. Using publicly
available datasets of tweets for each election, we
perform sentiment analysis on the text of tweets to
quantify their degrees of negativity and subjectivity.
We also identify political leanings of tweets by analyzing
their hashtag usage and identify “dialogue”
occurring between and amongst left- and right-leaning
users by analyzing the tweets’ user mentions. We
then conduct permutation testing on these various
groupings of tweets between the two years to determine
if there is statistical evidence of increased polarization
and negativity on social media surrounding the
U.S. presidential election from 2016 to 2020, both
generally and between and within political parties.
We
find that election-related tweets in 2020 generally
used less neutral language than in 2016 but were
not
conclusively more positive or negative in sentiment.
Introduction
:
The 2020 presidential election in the United States
was polarizing for the American people, perhaps even
historically so, as Americans grappled with casting
their votes for Joe Biden or President Donald Trump
in light of major events that took place in 2020,
including the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic at the
beginning of the year and the racial protests and
riots sparked by the murder of George Floyd in May.
Happenings such as these have led the American people
to regard the year 2020 as generally negative,
public discourse being rife with statements such as
“I just want 2020 to be over.” There is also talk
amongst the media and general public that, politically,
Americans are “more divided than ever,” largely in
reference to conflicting opinions about Donald Trump’s
controversial presidency. We are curious if there
is empirical evidence of Americans’ attitudes towards
politics becoming increasingly negative and
polarized as suggested by these common sentiments.
The aim of this investigation is to determine if there
is evidence of increasing polarization and negativity
in regard to politics in recent years among the American
public on social media, which we do by
performing sentiment analysis and permutation testing
on tweets related to the 2016 and 2020 presidential
elections. We choose to analyze Twitter data (tweets)
because Twitter has become a popular platform for
voters and candidates to express their beliefs and
sentiments. Social media has been the focus of many
studies on sentiment analysis in recent years given
its rise popularity as a medium for public discourse
and the unique nature of text on such platforms, with
its heavy use of slang, acronyms and abbreviations,
emoticons, etc. requiring a different analytical approach
from traditional text. Notably, in 2015
researchers at Georgia Tech developed a lexicon and
rule-based sentiment analysis tool named VADER
(for Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning)
that is specifically attuned to analyze social
media text with high accuracy, outperforming individual
human raters at classifying the sentiments oftweets, for example [1]. VADER is backed by a lexicon of 7,500 words, acronyms and emoticons
commonly used in microblogs that are scored on a scale
from “Extremely Positive” to “Extremely
Negative” assessed via a wisdom-of-the-crowd approach.
It also factors in textural features such as
exclamation points and capitalization to determine
the intensity of text snippets. We use VADER to
determine the sentiments of tweets in this investigation.
In terms of investigating politics on Twitter,
in
December 2019, Knight Foundation released a study
analyzing the political dynamics of 86 million tweets
from 2017 [2]. In this study, they binned Twitter
users into four political segments—extreme left, center
left, center right, and extreme right—and found
that the political spectrum on Twitter skews heavily
center left, with 10% of users falling in extreme
left
segment, 57% in the center left, 8% in the center
right, and 25% in the extreme right, also indicating
that
conservative representation in Twitter is dominated
by the far right. These are important considerations
to
factor into interpreting the results of our investigation.
Our work bears some similarity to Knight
Foundation’s in that it is also based on assigning
political leanings to users, however, our approach
refers
to tweets’ hashtag usage to do so, whereas Knight
Foundation’s assigns leanings to users based on the
type of well-known, politically involved users they
follow. Additionally, our investigation is focused
on
how polarization and negativity on Twitter may have
changed over time, which is not a factor of the
Knight Foundation study.
We use two different datasets of tweets in this investigation,
one for each election. The dataset of tweets
related to the 2016 election was compiled by researchers
at Harvard [3]. It was collected through
data-driven keyword search using Twitter’s API and
contains approximately 280 million ids of tweets
related to the 2016 presidential election from between
July 13, 2016, and November 10, 2016. These
tweet ids are further broken down into subcategories
based on different events: the election day, debates,
and conventions. Each tweet id maps to a unique tweet,
the full content of which we fetch (in a process
called “hydration”) using Twarc, a Python package
that is linked to Twitter’s API. Each hydrated tweet
contains data fields such as the full text of the
tweet, the hashtags it uses, the users it mentions,
if it was an
original tweet or retweet, etc., as well as information
about the Twitter user who authored the tweet. The
dataset for the 2020 election we use was compiled
by researchers at the University of Southern California
and contains over 800,000,000 tweet ids from May 12,
2020, through December 2020 [4]. The ids were
collected by tracking various election-related keywords
and tweets from politically-affiliated accounts
using Twitter’s API. We randomly sample from these
datasets and perform some additional filtering to
compile our own datasets of 414,713 tweets for 2016
and 500,000 tweets for 2020. Though the two
datasets we use were collected by different groups,
they both were collected through comprehensive,
unbiased keyword searches that would have captured
the majority of political discussion on Twitter
surrounding the two elections, making them appropriate
for our analyses here. We hypothesize that within
this data there will be a shift towards more negative
sentiment and less neutrality from 2016 to 2020.
Exploratory Data Analysis:
For our exploratory data analysis, we first found
the 50 most common hashtags for 2016 and for 2020.
For 2016 the most common hashtag used was trump, with
almost 8,000 occurrences (Figure 1). For 2020
the most common hashtag was again trump but with only
over 2,000 occurrences (Figure 2). We then
created a new column called baseline which contained
the baseline occurrence for each tweet in thedataset. We found it by dividing the number of occurrences of the hashtag by the total number of tweets in
our dataset. For the most common hashtag in 2016,
‘trump’, the baseline rate was 0.0189 (Figure 3).
In
2020, the most common hashtag, ‘trump’, has a baseline
occurrence rate of 0.002 (Figure 4). We then
plotted a histogram that showed the distribution of
the number of posts per user. For 2016, this
distribution was right-skewed with its largest spike
around 50 (Figure 5). For 2020, the distribution
was
also right skewed but with a spike around 40 (Figure
6). We then plotted two more histograms which
showed the distribution of the number of retweets
per user. For 2016 and 2020, the distributions are
right-skewed with spikes around 0.0 (Figures 7 & 8).

Methods:
Data downloading and cleaning process:
The 2016 and 2020 raw datasets consist of text files
of tweet ids, which we randomly sample from to get
datasets of workable sizes. For the 2016 dataset,
we sample 1 out of 300 tweet ids, and for the 2020
dataset, we sample 1 out of 30. We then use twarc
to “hydrate” the ids, fetching the content of their
corresponding tweets. To maintain uniformity for sentiment
analysis, we filter out tweets in languages
other than English. Additionally, the two datasets
were collected by different groups that used different
keyword searches to gather election-related tweets,
so for our analysis to not be affected by this, we
have
to unify them under a universal keyword search. The
keyword search used for the 2020 dataset was more
exhaustive and broad than that used for the 2016 dataset,
so we filter the 2020 dataset using the 2016
keywords, changing the names of the candidates to
align with the 2020 election. Our final datasets consist
of 414,713 tweets from 2016 and 500,000 tweets from
2020.
Left and right separation:
We assign political leanings to a subset of the tweets
that are authored by partisan news sources or
politicians or that use politically-charged hashtags.
We compile lists of right- and left-leaning Twitter
accounts of partisan news sources by selecting those
determined to be far-left or far-right by statistical
analysis of popular news outlets performed by
AllSides.com
.
We add to these lists the accounts of all of
the candidates listed on the 2016 and 2020 Democratic
and Republican Party presidential primaries’
Wikipedia pages. With this, we have (far from exhaustive)
lists of relatively influential Twitter users
whose political leanings are well-defined.
To otherwise identify left- and right-leaning tweets
among tweets, we refer to their hashtag usage. We
hand-pick clearly left- and clearly right-leaning
hashtags among commonly used hashtags within the sets
of tweets for both years. For 2016, for example, left-leaning
hashtags include ""voteblue"" and ""donthecon""
and right-leaning hashtags include ""maga"" and ""lockherup"".
We do not include hashtags such as “trump”
in our search because they could be used to speak
both favorably and unfavorably about their subjects.
Then, for a given year, we make left and right subsets
of tweets by selecting ones that include at least
one
hashtag from the respective lists, excluding those
that include hashtags from both lists. We then make
lists
of right- and left-leaning users by collecting the
screen-names from each subset. We remove the
intersection of users from these lists, interpreting
such users' political leanings to be inconclusive
considering they authored tweets that included both left- and right-leaning hashtags. With this, we now
have a list of screen names for each political leaning,
with no overlap between them. We combine these
with the respective lists of politicians and partisan
news sites accounts and then gather all of the tweets
from the dataset authored by these accounts to arrive
at our final left- and right-leaning subsets of the
following numbers of tweets:

Table 1: Counts of left- and right-leaning tweets
by year
Dialogue separation:
Having assigned political leanings to some of the
tweets, we can identify dialogue happening between
and
within the two political spheres by analyzing their
user mentions. For a given year, we gather the left-
and
right-leaning tweets that mention at least one user
and classify the dialogue occurring as either L-L,
L-R,
R-L, or R-R depending on the leaning of the author
of the tweet and that of the user(s) they mention.
For
example, if a tweet is authored by a left-leaning
user and mentions one or more right-leaning users,
it is
classified as L-R.  If the leaning of one or more
of the users mentioned is unknown, that is, they are
not
present in our lists of left- or right-leaning users,
the dialogue is not classified. Through this process,
we
identify the type of dialogue of the following numbers
of tweets:

Sentiment analysis:
In order to conduct our sentiment analysis on the
full text of tweets from 2016 and 2020, we used the
Vader Python library. Initially, we conducted sentiment
analysis using the Python library named Textblob.
Textblob references a lexicon library and assigns
polarity and subjectivity to all of those specific
words
and averages them to find the polarity/subjectivity
of the entire text. However, as will be discussed
further
in the discussion, upon further research and analysis
of our Textblob results, we decided to move forward
with a different library called Vader since it was
more appropriate for the specific social media data
that
we are analyzing. Vader uses a dictionary in order
to map lexical features to sentiment scores, which
are
emotion intensities. By summing up the intensity of
each word in a text, Vader can obtain the overall
text’s sentiment score. Vader is intuitive, in that
it understands the implications of capitalization
and
punctuation. It also will take the usage of negative
words such as “not” or “no” into account. Vader has
four classes of sentiments that it assigns these scores
to. These classes include
positive
,
negative
,
neutral
,
and
compound
. The compound class is an aggregated
score of the first three classes and it ranges from
-1.0 to +1.0. These compound scores can tell us whether
or not our text was expressing a positive,
negative, or neutral opinion. A text with an overall
positive sentiment would have a compound score ofgreater than 0.05. On the other hand, a text with an overall negative sentiment  would have a compound
score of less than -0.05. A neutral sentiment text
would have a compound score of somewhere in between.
Permutation testing:
We conducted permutation testing on the differences
in mean compound score and neutrality between
2020 and 2016 for different groupings of our data:
the data overall; the left and right subsets; and
the
left-left, left-right, right-left and right-right
dialogue subsets. We chose to perform permutation
tests to be
able to assess if the results of our sentiment analysis
and determine if the differences in these sentiments
between the two election cycles were statistically
significant. We stated that the null hypothesis was
that
there was no change in the compound score or neutrality
score between the two years. We chose to use the
mean as the test statistic as we concluded that using
the mean score would be a meaningful statistic to
represent the compound score and neutrality score
for each year and an effective way to compare the
two
distributions. To perform the permutation test, we
found the observed difference between the two
distributions (the difference in means) and randomly
sampled the two distributions without replacement.
We then found the p value as the proportion of sampled
differences greater than our observed difference
and used this p value to accept or reject our null
hypothesis.
Results:
Figures 1 and 2 show the results of the Compound scores
achieved via sentiment analysis of the full text
of tweets of the various subsets of data for 2016
and 2020, respectively. Recall that a Compound score
of
-1 indicates extreme negative sentiment and +1 indicates
extreme positive sentiment., with Vader
assigning a default score of 0.0 if it does not recognize
enough of the text to assign a polarity. Across all
subsets, a Compound score of 0.0 was most common.
Visually, there is a high degree of similarity
between the distributions for the two years. The most
noticeable difference is that L-R dialogue became
more left skewed in 2020, which would indicate an
increase in negative sentiment within this group.Figure 1: Distributions of 2016 Compound scores
Figure 2: Distributions of 2020 Compound scores
Similarly, Figures 3 and 4 show the results of the
Neutrality scores achieved via sentiment analysis
of the
full text of tweets of the various subsets of data
for 2016 and 2020. Recall that a Neutrality score
of 0
indicates that none of the text was neutral and 1.0
indicates that all of the text was neutral, which
is the
default score Vader outputs if it does not recognize
enough of the text to assign a polarity. Across all
subsets, a Neutrality score of 1.0 was most common.
Visually, there is a high degree of similarity between
the distributions for the two years, but there seems
to be a general trend of the data becoming slightly
more left skewed in 2020, indicating less use of neutral
text, a change that is particularly evident in the
L-R dialogue subset.

Figure 4: Distributions of 2020 Neutrality scores
For empirical evidence of change in sentiment of tweets
between the 2016 and 2020, we refer to the
results of permutation tests on the differences in
mean scores. Table 3 provides a breakdown of the
observed differences in means and the p-values attributed
to these differences as a result of the
permutation tests, with statistically insignificant
results based on a 95% confidence level highlighted
in
red. Figures 5 and 6 provide graphical representations
of these test results for the Compound and
Neutrality scores, respectively, with the observed
differences between the 2020 and 2016 mean scores
represented by dotted red lines. Aligning these results
with the language of our hypothesis, a negative
Compound difference indicates an increase in negativity
and a negative Neutrality difference indicates a
decrease in neutrality.

From these results, we can see that, overall, the
2020 tweets were overwhelmingly more positive and
less
neutral than the 2016 tweets. With the exception of
the L-L dialogue subset, for which the results are
inconclusive (p=0.052), tweets used less neutral language
in 2020 than in 2016 across all subsets.
Results for the Compound scores are less conclusive,
as the direction of change differs depending on the
subset. There is no detectable difference in Compound
score for left-leaning tweets (p=0.49), whereas
right-leaning tweets were conclusively more positive,
with a mean increase of 0.02678 in Compound
scores As for dialogue, L-L and R-L dialogue became
more positive from 2016 to 2020, with mean
increases in Compound scores of 0.07682 and 0.05880,
respectively, and L-R and R-R dialogue became
more negative, with mean decreases in Compound scores
of -0.10595 and -0.05066.
Discussion:
As determined by our results, we observed that in
terms of neutrality the 2020 tweets were actually
overwhelmingly more positive and less neutral when
compared to the 2016 tweets. In terms of the
compound score, right leaning tweets were more positive
while left-leaning tweets had no detectable
differences. This disproves our hypothesis which stated that between 2016 and 2020, there will be an
overall shift towards a more negative sentiment and
less neutrality. We observed that, although there
was
an overall decrease in neutrality, there was actually
a shift towards more positive sentiment on Twitter
between the two election cycles. This decrease in
neutrality was particularly evident when we analyzed
the dialogue between the left-leaning and right-leaning
users, indicating that users who are left-leaning
but mention right-leaning users used noticeably less
“neutral” language and became more polarized.
Although there was a general positive shift between
the cycles, we did notice that between these same
subsets of users there was actually an increase in
negative sentiment. We can conclude that users who
identified as left-leaning, but mentioned right-leaning
groups became more negative in their dialogue
between 2016 and 2020.  Thus, although we did notice
an overall positive shift in sentiment, this unique
subset provides us with insight into how the interactions
between groups of the two parties changed
between the two cycles; there seems to be an increase
in political polarization and negative feelings from
those who are left-identified to those who are right
identified and this is reflected in stronger and
more
politically-charged tweets. This could be a result
of the frustrations harbored during the 2016-2020
presidential cycle as well as the use of Twitter as
a platform to tweet opinions more openly and
aggressively towards users of opposing parties. Interestingly,
the dialogue between right-leaning users
who mention left-leaning users became more positive
between the two cycles, indicating that although
the
left-leaning users might have interacted with the
right more aggressively it is not the same vice versa.
In
addition, the dialogue within left users demonstrated
a more positive shift, but that within right users
became more negative, indicating that we can’t make
conclusive statements in terms of the sentiment shift
within a certain political party, but perhaps there
was more optimism within the left-leaning users with
the
new hope that came with the new election cycle, and
more worry / pessimism within the right. Thus,
although there was an overall positive shift of tweets
regarding the election between the two cycles, we
were able to gain interesting insights by examining
the dialogue between users and the two groups.
Our work was similar, but different to the prior work
completed about this topic. We cited an article where
researchers classified Twitter users into four segments
by assigning leanings to users based on the type
of
well-known, politically involved users they follow.
These researchers found that the overall conservative
representation on Twitter was dominated by the far
right. Our results were a little different as the
purpose
of our project was to use sentiment analysis to come
to conclusions about the change in sentiment
between different users in the two election cycles.
However, we used a similar approach to the researchers
of classifying Twitter users into left-leaning or
right-leaning, but we did so by identifying left-and
right-leaning hashtag
s.
Textblob
As mentioned in the methods portion, we initially
conducted our sentiment analysis using the Python
library Textblob. To do this, we created two functions:
sentiment_polarity and sentiment_subjectivity. The
first function finds the polarity of the text. This
polarity score is a float within the range [-1.0,
1.0]. A
negative score would mean that the text has mainly
negative connotations while a positive score means
the opposite. The second function finds the subjectivity
of the text and it returns a float within the range
[0.0, 1.0] with 0.0 is very objective and 1.0 is very
subjective. We applied these two functions to the
full_text column in the 2016 and 2020 dataset. For
the 2016 dataset, the mean polarity was 0.054 while
the mean subjectivity is 0.333. This means that the
tweets from 2016 have an overall positive polarity
while being more on the objective side. For 2020,
the mean polarity score is 0.056 while the subjectivity
is 0.340. This means that the tweets from 2020 also
are more objective with an overall positive polarity.Upon further analysis of these results and research into various methods of sentiment analysis for Twitter
data, we decided to use another library, Vader, so
we could compare our scores and results. In the end
we
decided to use Vader as the tool for conducting sentiment
analysis because it is geared towards social
media text specifically and it can understand slang
and emojis while Textblob was more commonly used
for general text.
One large limitation of our approach is the size of
the data that we used. After splitting our overall
dataset
into groups based on L-R, R-L, etc., some of these
smaller groups had only a fairly small number of
tweets left for us to analyze. For example, our 2016
L-R dialogue group only had 854 tweets which might
not be enough to draw a substantial conclusion. Also,
it is important to take the general demographics
of
Twitter into account when looking at our results.
While we assume that Twitter has an equal number of
people of all political leanings, this is not the
case. As of 2020, the largest age demographic that
is active
on Twitter is from 25-34 years old
1
, and it is also
important to note that more than 50% of people in
this
age category are generally left-leaning
2
. This would
mean that a majority of the tweets we find in our
dataset would be more left-leaning than right-leaning
but this is not necessarily representative of the
entire
United States population.  Another limitation in our
approach might come from the fact that our 2020 and
2016 datasets were considerably different, which required
us to filter it. The way in which we conducted
our filtering of the 2020 dataset in order for it
to be aligned with the 2016 dataset might have been
ineffective. Moreover, when we were filtering our
tweets into right and left leaning, those users whose
leaning was unknown were also not present in our subgroups
for sentiment analysis. These filtering
processes might have had us remove valuable tweets
that would have been helpful for us to draw
conclusions on.
There is a lot of room for expansion for our project.
In the future, it would be interesting to expand
our
dataset to include the political tweets from a longer
time period, such as over the entire four years
between 2016 to 2020, so we get a better idea of how
the public sentiment on Twitter changed over a
continuous time period. It might be interesting to
look at tweets over this entire time period due to
the fact
that it was very tumultuous in American history because
we had a controversial president. We could use
our methods of dividing the data into subsets depending
on political dialogue and then perform sentiment
analysis and permutation testing on these groups to
see if they uphold the same conclusions that we had.
It
might also be interesting to expand our analysis to
include classification. We could use logistic regression
in order to predict what group (L-L, L-R, R-R, R-L)
a user would fall in depending on the text of their
tweet and compound scores.

Social media companies have developed systems for preventing the further spread of misinformation. Most notably, some companies have begun placing flags that warn a user of the misinformative content of the post. Research has addressed a way to analyze Twitter users on how conservative versus liberal, moderate versus extreme, and pro-science versus anti-science they are based on their tweet history [2]. We detail a novel machine learning approach to classify users based on three similar dimensions. We then conduct an analysis comparing Twitter users who retweeted flagged tweets to those who retweeted unflagged tweets, with the tweets coming from high profile conservative Twitter users, such as Eric Trump. Results from the analysis suggest that users who are sharing these flagged tweets tend to be slightly more liberal and more moderate than the users who are sharing unflagged tweets. We propose possible explanations, as well as future work to better understand the impact of misinformation flags.  Introduction. ​The spread of misinformation among social networks is a critical problem facing societies today. The world has faced rapid and widespread dissemination of misinformation through social networks. Recently, users on social networks have sewn fear and mistrust regarding the US election process by spreading false information about the voting process [5]. As well, after the election, doubt was further spread about the validity of the election based on incorrect and intentionally misleading information [6]. With the threat that misinformation poses to societies, social networks, doubtlessly encouraged by public dismay, have sought to find ways to rein in the spread and prevalence of misinformation within their networks. Twitter, in particular, has developed a method of flagging tweets that contain potential misinformation as a way to inform users of the malicious content while deterring its continued spread. Current understanding of the effects of this system is not well understood, however, preliminary research has shown that there may be real benefits in deterring some types of misinformation [1]. There is a need to understand the effects these systems are having in order to improve upon them. Specifically, given flagged and unflagged tweets from the same users, are different types of users interacting with the flagged tweets compared to the unflagged tweets? By exploring this question, more work can be done to understand how to improve the effectiveness of misinformation prevention systems. We combine machine learning and a user's polarity, a quantitative measure of the users preferences for information, to give us comprehensive three dimensional polarity scores. We collect a sample of unflagged and flagged tweets coming from several different popular conservative Twitter users. We then conduct an analysis on the differences and similarities of a community of users that interacted with the unflagged tweets and a community that interacted with the flagged tweets. We are then able to better understand how misinformation flags change the makeup of the users who interact with flagged tweets.   Related Work. ​In  ​Echo Chambers Surrounding Misinformation on Twitter, ​researchers developed a methodology for calculating a user's polarization, i.e. whether they tend to like misinformation [3]. The researchers demonstrated that using an analysis of hashtags that are correlated with misinformation they can get a reasonable idea of whether a user, based on their use of hashtags, tends to like misinformation. First, they gathered a few hashtags that are indicative of misinformation amongst COVID-19 tweets, for instance #hoax. Second, they gathered hashtags indicative of scientific understandings of COVID-19 like #wearamask. Using these several marker hashtags they then defined a concept of hashtag polarity which describes how much a new hashtag tends to correspond with misinformation related hashtags or scientific ones. Using these hashtag polarities the team analyzed users' hashtag history in order to then describe the polarity of that user. This concept of polarity allowed the researchers to analyze echo chambers surrounding COVID-19 misinformation. While we found this methodology unstable for our analysis, it nonetheless helped lay the groundwork for understanding a user’s preferences from a polarity score.  Furthering the idea of user polarities, Rao et al. in ​Political Partisanship and Anti-Science Attitudes in Online Discussions about Covid-19 ​designed a methodology for giving a user a polarity score for three separate dimensions. In this study, the researchers, in order to quantify a user's attitudes, defined a three dimensional polarity score based on a user's attitudes regarding science, politics, and moderacy [2]. Each user was then defined based on their tweet history in regards to how pro-science versus anti-science, conservative versus liberal, and moderate versus extreme they are. Using these scores, the researchers were able to understand how polarized users in one dimension are related to those in another dimension. For instance, they found that users with politically moderate views tend to hold more pro-science views, while those with hardline views, on the left and right, tend to hold more anti-science views [2]. While Rao et al. use more extensive techniques in order to define polarities, we nonetheless adopt their three dimensional polarity score in our own methodology. We design a machine learning approach that uses a classifier to calculate the user’s polarities. We find that our approach works well and some results are able to be confirmed intuitively. Our dimensions change slightly, focusing instead on how conservative versus liberal, moderate versus extreme, and credible versus incredible a user’s preference for information is. Using these three dimensional polarity scores, we then conduct our analysis regarding the change of community characteristics between flagged tweets and unflagged tweets.  While there is doubt whether warning labels are sufficient enough to stop a user from spreading misinformation, there is evidence of their effectiveness from a study done by the China Media Project on the change in engagement with Twitter users that Twitter decided to label as state affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party. Essentially, Twitter made the decision that media profiles on Twitter that are state affiliated, discounting independent government sponsored organizations like the BBC in Britain and NPR in the U.S., should be flagged as state affiliated. Their choice was based on the idea that users have a right to know the context of the information that they are consuming. The study found that there was a dramatic decrease in terms of favorites and retweets with the users that had the label placed on them [1]. Furthermore, users with the flag noticed dramatic changes in the amount of new followers they were receiving. This may be a result of a change in Twitter’s algorithms so that flagged users no longer appear in the search bar when users type words related to their username. Interestingly to our study, this work demonstrates that although there is a change in engagement after a user has had a flag placed on them there is still a reduced community of users that are interacting with the flagged tweets. We suggest that this reduced community portrays a similar set of characteristics that can be partially understood along the three dimensions of polarity we defined. While this group’s work focused more on the effectiveness of misinformation flags in this particular context, we continue their work but with a focus on understanding the types of users that are ignoring misinformation flags. We also note the differences of their study with ours, as the state affiliated flags were attached to all tweets of a user, whereas misinformation flags are attached to only a small minority of tweets posted by even the most controversial users.  Modeling & Data. ​In order to conduct our analysis, we laid out a methodology for calculating the polarities of users that retweeted flagged and unflagged tweets. We first attempted to use a hashtag analysis approach, as was used in ​Echo Chambers Surrounding Misinformation on Twitter, ​but applied to three dimensions instead of one. However, this approach proved unstable as many users do not use the collection of popular hashtags that our analysis was conducted on. Moving forward, we designed a more robust and novel machine learning approach that allows us to categorize user’s polarities along a spectrum, giving us a more nuanced understanding of each user’s preferences. To train our models, we took advantage of the TweetSets data repository managed by the George Washington University which contains Twitter activity of many political and government related users, including news organizations. We curated a list of news organizations across the ideological spectrum and used the independent bias rating website Media Bias/Fact Check to assign scores regarding credibility, political bias, and moderacy for each news organization. See Figure 1 for an example of the rating system used by Media Bias/ Fact Check. For the political polarity dimension we assigned a political polarity score as follows: -3: Extreme Left, -2: Left, -1: Center Left, 0: Least Bias, 1: Center Right, 2: Right, and 3: Extreme Right. Likewise for the credibility dimension we assign a score using the factual reporting section of Media Bias/ Fact Check, as follows: 0: Very Low, 1: Low, 2: Mixed, 3: Mostly Factual, 4: Highly Factual, and 5: Very Highly Factual. Lastly, the moderacy score is calculated by: 0: Least Bias, 1: Left Center, Right Center, 2: Left, Right, and 3: Extreme. A breakdown of the scoring system is seen in Table 1. With these scores, we then get an accurate sense of how liberal or conservative, credible or not credible, and moderate or extreme a news organization is, which we will assume is reflected in the content of that organization’s tweets, which we had obtained from TweetSets.  
 
Figure 1.  
 Table 1.  Continuing the methodology, a tweet history for each news organization was downloaded from the TweetSets repository and then hydrated, a process in which you download a full tweet based MBFC Bias Rating Assigned Political Rating MBFC Factual Rating Assigned Credibility Rating MBFC Moderacy Rating Assigned Moderacy Rating Extreme Left -3 Very Low 0 Extreme Left 3 Left -2 Low 1 Left 2 Center Left -1 Mixed 2 Center Left 1 Center 0 Mostly Factual 3 Center 0 Center Right 1 High 4 Center Right 1 Right  2 Very High 5 Right 2 Extreme Right 3   Extreme Right 3 on an ID number. Once hydrated, every tweet from an organization is assigned a score for each of the three dimensions using the system we laid out above. We then extract only the tweet text for every tweet and we use every tweet as the instances making up our training set and the polarity scores being our three targets when training three separate classifiers. We split the dataset into training and validation portions and used a TF-IDF vector representation of every tweet’s text as the dependent variable. We then trained three separate Naive Bayes models for each dimension and achieved accuracy scores of 53%, 62%, and 62% for the political, credibility, and moderacy dimensions respectively. Note that while these scores do not appear very good, our task at hand more closely resembles a regression task, however, we found Naive Bayes to have the best performance in terms of mean average error (MAE). In this case, the MAE scores of the three dimensions were 1, .6, and .4, respectively. For each of the three dimensions these are relatively low errors and reflect well on the accuracy of our model. We must also mention that while the models perform well between the training and validation sets, we must assume that the distributions of tweets from normal users must be similar to the distributions of tweets from news organizations. Under this assumption the models should perform similarly when classifying users based on their tweet history, although we acknowledge the possibility that news organizations tweets are semantically different from those of regular users. We feel our assumption is credible. Since Twitter limits the amount of characters within its tweets it is likely our bag of words technique picked up on most words that are shared between both news organizations and users.   Our team then collected a sample of flagged and unflagged tweets from the users Tomi Lahren, Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr, Rudy Guiliani, Adam Laxalt, Maria Bartimoro, and Paduch. These users were chosen because they each have several flagged tweets surrounding the events of the January 6th riot at the U.S. Capitol and the 2020 U.S. election. We focus on these two events as they are relatively recent and Twitter was very active in flagging misinformation around the two events. However, we do note that the flagged tweets have a general right leaning skew due to the political nature of the two events. This is somewhat unavoidable as Twitter’s API does not have a property for detecting flagged tweets, thus it is difficult to construct a randomly sampled set of flagged tweets. For our initial study, using only the 7 users we outlined will be sufficient as it will still give us an understanding of whether there is a change in the type of user that is interacting between flagged tweets and unflagged tweets. Since we are focusing on users within a similar ideology, we assume that the change in the types of users engaging in flagged and unflagged tweets will be somewhat similar across the several different users. Our study is thus particularly focused on how flagged and unflagged right wing tweets differ in types of users that are retweeting the information.  Furthermore, for each flagged tweet selected we chose an unflagged tweet that was tweeted relatively close in time to the flagged tweet, i.e. within a few days, and from the same user. This is to prevent large changes in the makeup of the followers of the users that we selected above. We then collected up to 100 users, as permitted by the Twitter API, that retweeted the original tweets. This came out to be 669 users in total. Using Tweepy, we downloaded the history of their tweet timelines. We extracted only the text of their tweets and then ran every tweet through each of our respective models. For every user, we averaged each predicted polarity score for every one of their tweets from our three different models, thus giving us our three scores. The outcome of this can be seen in Figure 2, where every row is a user and the Flagged column indicates whether that user retweeted a flagged or unflagged tweet. Using this methodology we are able to get a more substantial and non-biased idea of a user’s scores along the political, credibility, and moderacy dimensions, thus allowing us to perform our analysis.   
 
Figure 2.  Results. ​Our analysis focused on detecting if there were any significant differences between the group of users who retweeted a flagged tweet and the group who retweeted unflagged tweets. We first do a simple exploratory analysis comparing the distributions of the two groups along each of the three dimensions. We then conduct a series of permutation tests to detect if there are statistically significant differences between the two groups. Beginning with analysis of the political polarization scores, note in Figure 3, that the distribution of polarization scores from the flagged group actually appears slightly more to the left, indicating a more liberal polarization score than the users who retweeted the unflagged tweets. We also note for the flagged distribution that there is a hump on the right side of the normal curve, indicating a still sizable amount of users with a more right leaning polarization score. Both plots show a long right tail stretching to the upper extreme right end of the polarization score, something we would expect given the right leaning nature of the tweets we are examining. The results of the permutation test, run between the two groups of users and their political polarization scores, confirms what we see in the graph. Specifically, that the political polarization of users retweeting the flagged posts are significantly more liberal than the group of users retweeting the unflagged posts. This result is unexpected, as the flagged tweets were all aligned with right wing talking points, such as claiming fraud regarding the 2020 election. The evidence suggests that flagging, at least right leaning tweets, has a more complicated outcome than just attracting further right wing users, an outcome we ourselves predicted. Possible explanations for this are explored more thoroughly in the Discussion section. 
 Figure 3.  In Figure 4, comparing the distributions of the moderacy scores, we note a similar trend to the political distributions. The group of users retweeting the flagged tweets show a tendency to be more moderate, rather than extreme. This is somewhat the opposite of the result we would expect. We would expect that only the most extreme users are the ones retweeting tweets that have been flagged. The visual trend is further validated with a permutation test indicating that the group of users retweeting the flagged tweets are indeed more moderate than those retweeting unflagged tweets. However, the users retweeting unflagged posts actually show a larger tail on the right side, indicating a larger share of extreme users are retweeting the unflagged tweets. We do not necessarily suggest that flagged posts are deterring the most extreme users, only that the evidence suggests they are attracting more moderate users. Combining the outcome of the permutation test for the political dimension with the outcome for the moderacy dimension paints a clearer picture of the effect of the flags. The data suggests that more moderate, center left to left wing users are retweeting flagged tweets from right wing political figures in larger proportions than unflagged tweets. However, we do not see this trend continue along the credibility dimension. For credibility, as can be seen in Figure 5, the two groups share very similar distributions of scores and a permutation test validates that suspicion. This outcome is worrying in and of itself as it possibly suggests that while flags are causing a difference in users along a political and moderacy dimension, users show no change in their preference for credible 
information, hinting that there may be some confusion among users as to what information is actually credible. Without speculating too far, we wonder whether this points to a greater crisis brewing on social media, a blurring of lines between credible information and misinformation. 
 
Figure 4. 
 
Figure 5.  Discussion & Future Work. ​With the data we have currently it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions, but we are nonetheless able to observe an effect of misinformation flags, specifically when placed on tweets of right wing Twitter users. Our analysis revealed that misinformation flags change the makeup of the users retweeting tweets compared to users retweeting similar tweets that are unflagged. With confidence, our data suggests that misinformation flags are attracting more liberal and moderate users that are then sharing these posts. This outcome is opposite of what we had predicted, that misinformation flags of the tweets we collected would attract more extreme and right wing users. A larger analysis would need to be done to understand whether, while more liberal and moderate users are attracted to these flagged tweets, there is a greater amount of extreme and right wing users as well. Since our study was limited by the Twitter API only allowing access to 100 retweeters of a tweet, we have to speculate whether our findings apply across the entirety of users retweeting the original flagged and unflagged tweets. We also must note that Twitter does not tell us how the 100 retweeters are collected. For instance, are they the last 100 retweeters? In this case it is very probable that the misinformation flag had already been placed on the tweet prior to users retweeting it. Or is the 100 retweeters a random sample of all retweeters? This would make it more difficult to understand the effects that the flag is actually having because we do not know whether users retweeted the posts before the flag was placed on it. Given the significant differences in the makeup of the users retweeting the flagged tweets versus the unflagged tweets, as well as the similar content of the flagged tweets and unflagged tweets, we assume that users must have been aware of the flag before they retweeted. Otherwise, we would expect almost no difference in the types of users retweeting these tweets.  We further suggest that the reason for the increase in liberal and more moderate users is not because they agree with the contents of the flagged tweets. Rather, given the controversial nature of tweets that are flagged, we suspect that these users were more likely to want to retweet what they viewed as outrageous in a mocking sense. A logical extension to our analysis would then be a sentiment analysis of any retweets that include a comment attached to it. Analyzing these sentiments for our two groups of users would help reveal whether the increase in more liberal and moderate users also corresponds to more negative replies to the original tweet itself, rather than positive and supportive replies as would be expected. Further analyzing changes in the community of users that are following the original users who posted the tweets being analyzed, would also be helpful in understanding more long lasting effects of misinformation flags. For instance, since the beginning of the placement of misinformation flags by Twitter, has the amount of moderate and liberal users following these profiles increased? This would then explain and further validate why there is an increase in left and moderate users who retweeted flagged tweets.   With the observed results it is difficult to say whether Twitter’s misinformation flags prove to be effective or not. Undoubtedly, more research needs to be done. However, we can say that if our findings can be extrapolated across the entirety of the unobserved retweeters that we could not access, then it is likely that the misinformation flags proved somewhat useful in breaking down echo chambers around right wing misinformation. The following assumption would need to be validated, for instance through the sentiment analysis we outlined above. We speculate that the more liberal and moderate users retweeting flagged tweets are most likely doing so in a ridiculing way. With this in mind, then the misinformative nature of the tweets is being shared among communities of users that are more skeptical and critical of the information they are viewing. Thus, it is likely that the flagged tweets sparked more debate and scrutiny compared to unflagged tweets, a positive outcome. We are hopeful that this increase of debate would help users who traditionally consume extreme information unchecked be prompted to have to defend their views, whether externally against other Twitter users or internally with themselves. We do not express the opinion that these misinformation flags are the end all for preventing the spread of misinformation, but we acknowledge that there is evidence suggesting misinformation flags can lead to the breakdown of echo chambers and hopefully greater dialogue between users of different polarizations. We thus hope our research helps better understand and contributes to the prevention of the spread of misinformation on social media.

TWITTER
March 11, 2021
1 Abstract
Many researches have tackled the alignment of political ideology of entities on social media. How-
ever, few have considered quantifying political ideology free of human heuristics. In this project we
will construct a geometric definition of the political spectrum for twitter accounts of major news
outlets using an unsupervised approach. W e model the political alignments of the outlets in terms
of pairwise political similarity among pairs of outlets using an undirected graph and embed the
graph onto a 1-d Euclidean space for result. W e will quantify pairwise similarity based on the
hashtags used by users who recently retweeted the outlets in question. Through this, we construct
a relative and unsupervised quantification of political alignment and produces consistent results
that coincide with traditional conception of political leaning of news outlets.
2 Introduction
F actual reporting is critical to the education of the general public on not only regular news, but
more importantly to provide information paramount to understanding and interpreting the political
atmosphere. Major news outlets have always played a key role in delivering important news and
information to the public in a predictable and concise manner tailored to their viewers. As a result
of this conformation to the preferences of their respective audiences, many news networks have
developed a tendency to report news with a bias in various aspects of reporting; most notably , the
most prevalent defining characteristic of a news network is its political aﬀiliation. This often leads
to skewed information motivated by viewership and rating results. This bias in reporting can often
lead to creating confirmation bias in viewers who already agree with the sentiments being reported.
An example of the bipartisan split in television news networks can be seen in the contrast between
CNN and F ox news. CNN is widely considered to be a left-leaning or democratic organization, while
F ox is catered to a republican audience. This polarization of news is often criticized as furthering
the tunnel vision in viewers by only showing them what they already agree with. Similar to “echo
chambers” in The Spread of Misinformation Online, Vicario et al.[1], this action of reporting biased
news creates isolated communities of viewers where information is often circulated within their own
groups.
Although most news media outlets already have a pretty well defined political alignment, our
analysis will involve further verifying this classification and comparing these news stations on
different spectrums other than political aﬀiliation. The question we want to answer is whether
or not the users who actively interact with various news outlets conform directly to the political
viewpoint of the outlet. Our goal in this project is to quantify the political inclination (pro-democrat
1vs pro-republic) on the users of nine news stations. In other words, we want to construct a political
spectrum and see how these new stations fall on the spectrum.
3 Data
3.1 Collection
Through use of the T witter API, we are able to gather any data that was made publicly available on
the T witter platform. Per the terms of this API, we are unable to access any tweet that is protected
by a private account or has been deleted. Although we are collecting tweet data from individual
users, we will only be analyzing aggregated values from hashtags and will not be releasing any
individual data points.
The eight news stations we chose were BBCW orld, BreitbartNews, CBS, CNN, F oxNews, MSNBC,
R T_America, nytimes, and washingtonpost. W e decided on these accounts as they are all relatively
well-known and we wanted to have a sample of media outlets that were distributed along the political
spectrum and therefore chose outlets that are left, neutral and right leaning. Since the goal of our
project is to analyze the users that actively interact with each news station, we needed to gather
a sizable sample of tweets to quantify the general trend of political aﬀiliation. Our steps were as
follows: sample the most recent tweets from each news outlet, gather all retweeters in each tweet,
and then finally examine the retweeters by collecting the counts of hashtags used in each retweeter’s
timeline.
The main portion of our data collection process was gathering the users that actively interact with
the T witter accounts of major news stations. W e looked at the most recent 100 posts from each
news outlet and collected every retweet and subsequently every user who retweeted the post. After
collecting these users, we randomly sampled 500 users from each news station and gathered the
most recent 1000 tweets from each user’s timeline. If a user did not have 1000 tweets, we simply
took their entire timeline. This resulted in a minimum of 400,000 tweets in our dataset as the
average user has less than 1000 tweets, we assume that the average lies around 100 per user.
F rom these tweets, we collected every hashtag used and took down the occurrence of each hashtag.
T o account for minor variations in hashtag spelling and syntax, we stored each hashtag in its
lowercase form. Each news outlet now has a list of hashtags along with a mapping of the respective
number of times used in a tweet. This information will be used as a hashtag vector in our graph
analysis elaborated further in the methodology section.
Our definition of a user that “actively interacts” with a news outlet is someone who has retweeted
one of the outlet’s tweets in the past 3 months. Although it may have been easier to collect users
from the news outlets’ follower lists, we wanted to ensure our users analyzed were active on their
T witter so that we can analyze how they interact with current political accounts and tweets.

3.2 Exploratory Data Analysis
As the end goal of our project is to utilize hashtag usage for comparison of news outlets, we
wanted to begin by looking at the most commonly used hashtags relative to each news outlet. W e
believed that the most noticeable difference in hashtag trends would be politically motivated as
the traditional consensus is that these eight news outlets all have some sort of political aﬀiliation
or bias in their reporting, attracting users of the same political alignment.

T o do this, we looked to aggregate hashtag frequencies and compare the distributions across each
news outlet. There were a few common hashtags found across all eight news stations such as
variations of “covid-19” and “trump” . These words have relatively neutral meaning in terms of
political leaning and therefore looked into the effect of removing them in our methodology .

3Our first visualization was a horizontal bar chart designed to display the most popular hashtags used
in each news outlet. W e hypothesized that there will be a quantifiable difference in the hashtags
used by users of each news outlet due to the difference in population of their active users.
A brief glimpse into the figures below shows that there is indeed a noticeable difference in hashtag
usage between users of each news outlet, more specifically with news outlets of differing political
alignments.. W e found that politically charged words are the most prevalent separation between
each collection of hashtags.

Predicting the political alignment of users on social media has always been a topic of interest for
many scholars and institutions to research. As social media grows in popularity , more and more
users will begin to upload information about their personal lives, and oftentimes their political
beliefs, into the public domain for others to interact with. With this ever growing plethora of
information, many new approaches have been developed to better understand the characteristics
of US voters as opposed to traditional census and polling practices. While our project focuses
exclusively on analyzing the hashtag usage of our gathered users compared to an existing dataset
of election related tweets, there are many other publications that investigate a user’s actions in
more detail.
In Predicting the Political Alignment of T witter Users, Conover, Goncalves, Ratkiewics, Flammini
and Menczer demonstrated several implementations of predicting the political stance of a T witter
user based on their tweets. The paper utilized the hashtags and tweet text to build a machine
learning model for predicting a user’s political stance. In a SVM model, the researchers were
able to achieve a higher accuracy through metadata on hashtags versus tweet text. This coinsigns
with our hypothesis that hashtags will provide the best viable separation in how users display
their political stance. Their analysis also showed clear clusters that represented the two respective
political groups, republicans and democrats. Whereas the researchers defined the political stance
of hashtags through Latent Semantic Analysis to discover political aﬀiliation of hashtags, our group
will be plotting the hashtag vectors of each news outlet as a whole to demonstrate the differences
of news outlets in terms of vector space.
5 Methodology
5.1 Overall Process
W e are adopting an unsupervised approach towards quantifying the concept of political spectrum.
In short, we define the political spectrum to be the 1-D Euclidean space where the news station lies
and where outlets with similar political inclination would be close to one another. T o transform
the news stations into said space, we plan to construct a complete graph among the news stations
- where the nodes are our news stations in question and the edges are weighted by our pairwise
similarity (to be defined in the next paragraph) measure - and maps the graph onto the euclidean
space through spectral embedding using Laplacian EigenMap. The resultant plot - of the nodes
lying in the euclidean space in a fashion relative to their pairwise similarity - would be the main
answer to our research question.
5.2 Defining Pairwise Similarity for Graph
W e formally define the concept of similarity between two news stations to be the
Σmin(X1iX2i)
Σmax(X1iX2i)
where X1andX2are feature vectors for the two news stations. The feature space of the vector
is the hashtags used in tweets in the election dataset and the value for each feature is the nor-
malized/unnormalized (dependent on configuration) number of occurrences of each hashtag in the
user timeline dataset for each news outlet. Aside from the aforementioned optional normalization
of count of occurrences, other configuration of the feature space includes removing overly neutral
9hashtags based on a set of pre-defined hashtags (such as Covid-19, coronavirus) in an attempt to
remove overwhelming hashtags with overly neutral net implication. This method is our attempt to
capture the similarity in political view between pairs of news stations in an unsupervised approach.
Fig.1
data pipeline for feature vector
5.3 Embedding Graph
The method we chose for graph embedding is Laplacian Eigenmap. The minimization goal of the
method, which is∑
ij(yi−yj)2Wij
(y denotes euclidean coordinate of a node and Wij denotes the edge weight between the two nodes),
rewards short pairwise euclidean distance based on edge weight. This largely coincides with our
definition of a political spectrum and therefore is a sensible option for embedding.
T o recap we define the position of news stations in a political spectrum as their relative position in
euclidean space embedded from a graph that stores pairwise similarity , characterized as a function
of two vectors of hashtags under the same feature space, as edge weights between vertices. There
are a few advantages and disadvantages ostensible upon its conception.
6 Results
Through reducing the graph to a 1-D euclidean space, we can observe the pairwise similarity between
the news stations. Again, it is important to note that the plot only captures the relative position
of the news stations from the higher dimension euclidean space that they reside in. However, the
relative distance between the news stations are still observable from the plot.
10Fig 2.1
Fig 2.1 presents the result for our chosen similarity parameter - normalized vector, removed certain
hashtags and case insensitive hashtag counting. The resultant order on the spectrum from left
to right is CNN and MSNBC (largely overlapped), NYT, CBS, W ashington, BBC, R T, FOX,
Breitbart.
7 Discussion
In general, the main takeaway is that the aggregation of relative pairwise distance does indeed
lead to a resultant overall order of data points that fits our expectation, that is - the likes of CNN
on one end of spectrum and the likes of Breitbart News on the other. T aking a look back at
the similarities of the news stations in Fig. 2.1, CNN, MSNBC, the NewY orkTimes, CBSNews,
and the W ashington Post fit in their own cluster. BBCW orld and R T America are distant from the
other news stations but considering the small similarity between them, R T America fits closer to the
cluster of F oxNews and BreitbartNews. These clusters fit the convention of the political leanings
of the news stations.
Fig 3.1 Media bias Rating from AllSides Fig 3.2 Ideological placement from Pew Research Center
1112T o contextualize the conventional conception of political leaning of news outlets, we compare our
results to existing results from other researches on the same topic. Both the media bias rating from
AllSides and the ideological placement from Pew Research Center utilizes heuristic approaches such
as surveys and editorial reviews in their methodology . The order of news stations displayed in our
spectrum is very similar to that of the two previous researches mentioned above, with CNN and
MSNBC on one extreme and F ox and Breitbart on the other.
However, the difference between these findings and the conventional wisdom is that these groupings
were based off of the viewer bases of the news stations. Another thing to note is the similarity in
what is considered to be left leaning news stations to be a lot more tighter than those considered
to be right leaning news stations. This could point to a difference between the general fields of
thought or further divisions within the right side of the political spectrum but could be caused by
the limited sample of news stations observed.
Additionally , aside from our chosen set of parameters, we also performed a grid search on combi-
nations of other parameters for the similarity function. The findings made above are still present
with little variation when testing other combinations of the parameters for the function. While
there lies variation in the relative distances, the clusterings and ordering of are present in all of
the combinations available. W e believe that this low variance in result serves as evidence to the
robustness of this method of quantifying the political leanings and underlying political spectrum.
13The distinction that the viewer base reflects the political leanings of the news networks they follow
brings further questions. This correlation of political division needs further analysis and a deeper
dive into the dynamics and understanding of politics. At this point, there seems to be a relationship
between the political bias of viewers and that of the content and framing that is present in the
news presented by the news stations; whether that be the viewers influencing the content being
presented or the viewers influenced by the bias in the news itself but most likely something much
more nuanced and complex.
8 Conclusions
Throughout this paper, we observed the political leaning of several news stations observed through
the lens of their viewer base. F rom this we managed to capture that the viewer base holds a
tight correlation with the political leaning of the news stations they subscribe to. There is a slight
discrepancy between the findings and what is expected but within reason of variance. While this
finding may not be surprising for someone who is aware of the current political climate in America,
it is further statistical evidence to the division that the country is facing. While the direction of
the relationship between news stations and their viewer base was not explored, this serves as a
starting point for the potential importance of news stations as a key player in influencing political
thought and conversation. Bias in news continues to be an issue in providing factual information
to the general public.

Abstract
The rise of social media has dominated every aspect of our daily lives.
In the height of the 2020 presidential election and as COVID-19 rampaged
throughout the world, it facilitated increased online discussion, as well as
the spread of information and misinformation. This paper investigates the
relationship that discussion on social media has with election outcomes. It
nds that in comparing two distinct presidential elections, both of which
took place as Twitter usage grew steadily, increased discussion levels were
present in a Democratic win of the election.
1 Introduction
1.1 Signicance
Social networks facilitate the rapid dissemination of information and content
throughout the world as a result of the rise of internet technologies. These plat-
forms allow a person to connect and dialogue with various people, of dierent
creeds, colors, race, sexual orientation, and political ideology. Social media plat-
forms also indirectly support the segregation of people with dierent viewpoints,
as individuals with particular views tend to gather in a cluster and speak more
with those that share the same standpoints. As information begins to spiral, it
begins to have an inuence on people's thoughts, beliefs, and ideologies.
This has become increasingly important in the recent era, most notably during
2016 and 2020 presidential elections. For example, in 2016, Russia was accused
of interfering with the election through campaigns on social media. Popular
social platforms such as Facebook and Twitter allowed information to spread.
According to Donald Trump, these actions denitely contributed to his success
in the presidential race. His statement was that without Twitter, he would likely
have not won the election. Such a statement was refuted by Twitter's CEO Jack
Dorsey, who claimed that Twitter does not have the ability to inuence elec-
tions. Hence, our study looks into the extent to which election outcome could be
inuenced by opinions and discussions through online social media platforms.
11.2 Goals
Our goal in this paper is to investigate whether or not social media platforms
such as Twitter can have an impact on large-scale national events such as the
presidential election in the United States. To do so, we will be comparing
activity and discussion levels between two distinct and controversial elections,
the 2016 and 2020 elections. The dierentiating factor between both of these
elections, both of which caused dissension within the country, was the party
that won. In 2016, Donald Trump of the Republican party won against Hillary
Clinton of the Democratic party and in 2020, Joe Biden of the Democratic party
won against Donald Trump of the Republican party who was running for re-
election. Thus, if Twitter were to have the ability to potentially impact the
outcomes of these elections, there would have been a dierence in the amount
of activity on Twitter in between the two elections { this investigation is the
purpose of this paper. To achieve this outcome, we would produce an interactive
visualization of sentiment and level of discussion across time towards the 2016
and 2020 presidential elections. Additionally, We would like to create a tweet-
map of the United States for which the user would be able to look at aggregate
statistics for states and cities.
2 Related Work
As this has come under scrutiny in recent years, there has been a lot of analysis
done on Twitter's ability to have an impact on the outcome of presidential elec-
tions. Some studies have researched whether or not social media usage enables
right-wing growth or stie conservative speech. One such study delved into the
2016 election and showed that social media usage on Twitter decreased Donald
Trump's vote share by 0.2 percentage points [3]. The study claimed that social
media users were typically young, more educated, and live in areas with higher
population density and as such, would favor the Democratic party more often
than not. This is in contradiction to Donald Trump's own statement, attribut-
ing his victory to a substantial level of interaction with constituents via Twitter.
On the other hand, another research paper analyzed sentiment on Twitter and
showed that Twitter sentiment favored Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton in
2016, showing that perhaps sentiment is more indicative of the outcome [4].
These two studies contradict each other. The former doesn't address the fact
that Donald Trump ended up winning in 2016 despite Twitter usage lowering
his vote share while the latter claims that since sentiment was positive, Donald
Trump, in retrospect, was the clear winner.
This discrepancy is what this paper shall be investigating. In doing so, we
will be analyzing the discussion levels on Twitter in both the 2016 and 2020
elections. These elections were similar in that they both had high levels of chat-
ter and discussion on social media platforms, negative stories for both parties,
and debated content. We will attempt to see whether or not this discussion
2favors the Democratic party or the Republican party in this investigation.
3 Methods
To gauge social media's inuence on the outcome of elections, we dened a
measure of the activity level on Twitter, which we will referred to as the \level
of discussion"". Since online interaction can be quantitatively evaluated with the
number of likes and retweets for each original tweet, we will use the summary
statistics from data collected with the Twitter API. To aggregate a total level
of discussion, we will use the following formula to measure activity levels:
discussion = ln(1 +likes +retweets )
This formula came from needing to deal with a skewed distribution. Daily
discussion levels were incredibly right skewed, so we decided to log-scale them
to eliminate skew in the distributions and make analysis easier. In doing so, we
needed to add a 1 to each term to ensure that we were not taking the natural
log of 0, on days which may have had zero discussion.
As there were numerous tweets per day, the number of likes and retweets
were aggregated across each individual day over the election period in 2016 and
2020. These sums were then placed into the above formula and evaluated across
time. In doing so, we are able to gauge the level of activity on each specic
day and attribute such discussion to related key events throughout the election
period.
4 Data
The data that we gathered were collected by two dierent sources. Our 2016
Presidential Election Tweet dataset originated from Harvard's Dataverse [2].
These tweet IDs were collected using candidate and key-election hashtags as the
search query in the Twitter API via the Social Feed Manager feature.
The 2020 election dataset was gathered by graduate students at the University
of Southern California [1]. This group recognized the importance of study-
ing chatter on social media leading up to important events such as democratic
elections. In order to ease the process of collecting the data for computational
research, the group gathered Tweet IDs for each day within the election time
frame using keywords and hashtags as their search query. It tracks political
trends, events, and key gures within a one year time span. These tweet ID
les are hosted on their GitHub repository, from which we downloaded the data
using a script that ran cURL commands.
Both of these datasets are integral to our research and this investigation. The
2016 dataset only had tweets collected from July 13, 2016 and November 10,
32016 whereas the 2020 dataset had tweets originating from December 1, 2019
to January 29, 2021. In order to ensure that our investigation wasn't biased, we
narrowed our time frame to that of the Harvard dataset so as to be investigating
the same window of time in both elections.
4.1 EDA and Sentiment Analysis
To further investigate in our data, we prepossessed the tweets by cleaning non-
text features, removing stopwords, and converting to lowercase. Next, we uti-
lized a sentiment analysis to discover how the online conversations related to
the election were engaged. We adopted the usage of VADER from the NLTK
library and assigned a score on a scale of -1 to 1, with 1 being the most positive
end. Finally, we trained this model with our set of original tweets for both the
2016 and 2020 data and the results are shown in g 1.
Figure 1: Comparison of Overall Sentiment
We observe a similar bi-modal distribution in both histograms as it is reason-
able that the message from each tweet indicates either a positive sentiment or a
negative sentiment. However, the distribution is rather normal during the 2016
election period, with the two peaks around -0.5 and 0.5. In the 2020 election
period, we observe a more spread out distribution on tweets with a negative
sentiment, and a right tailed distribution on tweets with a positive sentiment.
This outcome leads to further analysis to determine how dierent the level of
twitter sentiment was between the two election years and how has it created an
impact on the election outcome.
Another step we took was to create word clouds that resembled the popular
terms used throughout tweets. As shown in g 2, the most common words are
usually related to the candidates of the year - Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton
in 2016 and Donald Trump and Joe Biden in 2020. The second tier of common
words are generally election related, some of which include 'say', 'thank', 'poll',
and 'people', most of which have neutral or positive connotations. Notably in
2020, 'covid' is one of the popular terms, however, the other general terms are
similar across the two election years. Hence, our EDA suggests that there are
minimal hidden variables that might impact the validity of our model.
4Figure 2: Word Clouds
4.2 Daily Sentiment Investigations
After completing the initial EDA, we looked into a time-series sentiment analysis
for each of the election periods. During the time-frame of July 13 to November
10 of each year, we plotted the average daily sentiment on a scale of -1 to 1.
Figure 3: Comparison of Daily Sentiment
The daily sentiment comparison is based on original tweets posted every
day. Due to sampling, the number of tweets everyday could vary across time,
especially in the months before the election day. Hence, the sentiment score
is xed to a frame of -0.15 to 0.15, with a positive threshold set at 0.05 and a
negative threshold at -0.05. A moving average of 7 days is also added to capture
the sentiment trends as well as peaks and troughs directly.
5In the 2016 plot (g 3 top), the daily sentiment uctuates severely through
July and August, as discussions about the leaders heated up every once a while.
Though uctuations also exist in the 2020 plot (g 3 bottom), the magnitude
is smaller and generally lies between the positive and negative thresholds. As
we approach the election day, the daily sentiment in 2016 dips twice, each cor-
responding to the presidential debates that occurred in early to mid-October.
The days in October with a negative sentiment is likely due to higher levels of
online conversation and topical discussion. In the sentiment trend for 2020, a
slight dip occurred towards the end of September, matching the date of the rst
presidential debate in that election year.
As we approach November, the 2020 trend peaked twice, once on election day
and again on the day the day President Biden was elected. This diered from
the 2016 trend as the single peak occurred only after when the election results
were nalized. Hence, the sentiment peaks and troughs throughout the election
period has been interconnecting with key election events and the discussion
levels are likely to be more concentrated during these dates.
5 Results and Analysis
The initial question was to identify a possible impact that Twitter may have
had on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2016 and 2020. In order to
to identify if this is true, we tracked daily discussion levels on Twitter during
the time frame from July 13 to November 10. Here we plot these distributions.
Figure 4: 2016 (left) and 2020 (right) Discussion Levels
As one can see, there is a major discrepancy between the two election periods.
The daily discussion levels in the 2016 election were much more normally
distributed in comparison to the 2020 election discussion levels, which was heav-
ily left skewed. This is reected in their mean discussion levels as well, with the
2016 election having a mean discussion level of 10.68 whereas the 2020 election
had a mean discussion level of 12.04.
6Figure 5: Comparison of Discussion Levels
5.1 Signicance Test
As we have noted, the distributions of the discussion levels in 2016 and 2020
were quite dierent where the discussion levels in 2016 were much more normally
distributed than in 2020. However, in order to quantify this dierence and verify
that it was signicant, we conducted a Z test with a dierence of means in two
samples. To do so, we found the probability of detecting such a dierence or
greater using the formula:
Z=1 2q
2
1
n1+2
2
n2
The test resulted in a Z score of 3.9985 which gave us a p-value of 0.0001346.
This passes all signicance tests, at the 0.1, 0.05, and 0.05 levels, showing that
the dierence in distributions observed is extremely signicant. As such, we can
reject the hypothesis that discussion levels were similar in the two elections.
5.2 Discussion
This dierence in the distributions as well as large dierence in the means of
discussion levels between the 2016 and 2020 elections lead us to believe the
work of the Fujiwara et. al paper [3]. Their research showed that exposure to
Twitter lowered the Republican vote share in the 2016 election, despite winning,
which they claim is driven by moderate and and independent voters. Given our
ndings, we believe this to be true, as a drastic increase in discussion levels on
Twitter as our investigation showed was present in the 2020 presidential election
which resulted in a win for the Democratic candidate Joe Biden.
76 Conclusion
Due to the increase in online communication and the expansion of social media
platforms, connecting with people and discussing about topical issues has been
prevalent in the United States. Even the political candidates of each party use
social media as a form of connection to the public and thus leading to online
discussions about such national events.
Given our analysis results, it is clear that sentiment has been a factor that
describes the level of discussion on twitter. Moreover, we formulated a level of
discussion metric that summarizes the magnitude of discussion and compared
such results between the election years 2016 and 2020. Our ndings suggest
that the online discussion has been more extensive in 2020 and the positive
sentiment as we approached the election day also support the fact that online
discussion has been supportive of the Democratic win in this election.

The study analyzes the level of discussion on Twitter and its relationship with election outcomes. The findings suggest that increased discussion levels on Twitter were present in the Democratic win of the 2020 election. The paper also discusses related research on Twitter's influence on elections, including studies that show contradictory results. The methods used in the study include measuring activity levels on Twitter using likes and retweets, sentiment analysis, and analyzing daily sentiment trends. The data used for analysis were collected from two different sources: Harvard's Dataverse for the 2016 election and a dataset gathered by graduate students at the University of Southern California for the 2020 election. The results show a significant difference in discussion levels between the two elections, with higher levels observed in 2020. This suggests that Twitter may have had an impact on the outcome of the elections. Overall, this paper provides insights into the relationship between Twitter and elections and highlights the importance of social media platforms in shaping public opinion during political events."

Analyzing the the Diffusions of Various Forms of Misinformation on Reddit
 
In September 2020, Gallup surveyed over a thousand US adults regarding social media
 
and the spread of misinformation online. They had found that nearly three-quarters (74%) were
 
very concerned about the spread of misinformation online, which seems to be relatively stable
 
across party lines. They also estimated that 61% of news content on social media to contain at
 
least some misinformation.
​
1
​
 With the increased discourse that is readily taking place on social
 
media, misinformation has started to grow, and sometimes even thrive within these platforms.
 
Whether it is as simple as the sighting of an alien or something more complicated like the
 
accusation of a stolen election, the effects of misinformation online can be destructive. We are
 
just beginning to see examples of these kinds of consequences and their lasting effects.
 
 
We hope to look at the spread of misinformation online, specifically on Reddit. We hope
 
to compare two different kinds of misinformation: one about political information as well as
 
about urban myth legends, while comparing that with how scientific information may spread on
 
this platform. We hope to analyze the diffusion of these kinds of content on Reddit, looking into
 
their respective spread patterns.
 
 
Data Generation and EDA
 
To obtain data, we used Pushshift Reddit API. Initially, we had plans to use PRAW, the
 
API provided by Reddit themselves; however, we found that it did not have all the features we
 
were looking for. We decided on the Pushshift Reddit API because it allowed us to download
 
data for posts and comments that were either deleted or archived in addition to the posts that are
 
currently live on Reddit. This allowed us to get more data and create less biased data since posts
 
in the misinformation subreddits get deleted more often than in the science subreddits. We also
 
preferred the Pushshift Reddit API due to the fact that it had a higher rate limit.
 
 
Using the Pushshift API we gathered data about users and their posts across subreddits
 
relating to scientific, urban myths, and misinformation. We collected data of the username of the
 
poster, the date of the post, and the subreddit of the post. Using this information, we can
 
calculate user polarity and further analyze the existence of echo chambers.
 
We collected data from 33 subreddits (11 from each category) which is about 2.4 million
 
comments. In the Myth category, we gathered comments from a wide variety of subreddits such

 as UFOs, conspiracy, BigfootEncounters. For the science category, we collected comments from
 
subreddits such as publichealth, askscience, and COVID19. For the political category, we
 
collected data also from a wide range of topics including flatearthsociety, The_Donald, and
 
LockdownSkepticism.
 
 
As you can see in the charts above, there were about about 1 million rows collected for
 
the politics category, about 1.2 million comments collected from the science category, and only
 
about 185 thousand rows from the myth category. The data is heavily skewed towards the
 
politics and science categories but that is because the subreddits from these categories are much
 
more popular compared to the ones from myth.
 
For each of these 2.4 million rows, we collected data on the author, time, id, and
 
subreddit of each comment. The author is defined by the username of the poster. The time
 
created is the time of when the comment was posted in UTC time. ID is the unique identifier of
 
the comment which can be used to rehydrate the comments at a later time if we so choose to.
 
Finally, we also kept track of the subreddit in which the comment was collected from.
 
Methodology
 
Our analysis begins by selecting a set of subreddits that can reasonably be labelled as
 
“factual,” “politically misinformative,” and “myth.” Such subreddits include r/science (factual),
 
r/The_Donald (politically misinformative), and r/Bigfoot (myth). We collect usernames from
 
comments made between March 2020 and June 2020, at the start of the pandemic.
  
Each user will then be rated with a “user polarity”, a set of three metrics representing
 
how often they browse each category of subreddit. Each metric is the percentage of comments a
 
user has made in a certain category of subreddit. For instance, a user who frequents and
 
comments in mostly factual pages may have a polarity of {science: 99%,
 
political_misinformation: 1%, myth: 0%}. User polarity is calculated by the following formula:

For each user, all three subreddit polarities will add up to 1, and will tell us how “loyal” a
 
user is to a certain category. The closer the polarity is to 1, the more loyal a user.
 
 
 
To analyze variations in echo chambers, we will be studying how likely users are to
 
participate in and consume either factual, politically misinformative, or mythological
 
information. Observing the tendencies of any one subreddit’s user base will shed light on its
 
users’ general consumption patterns. Aggregated usernames and their associated subreddits,
 
therefore, will provide the basis for this analysis.
 
 
Fig 1. Histogram of the political polarity of users
 
 
Fig 2. Histogram of the myth polarity of users
  
Fig 3. Histogram of the scientific polarity of users
 
The three graphs above represent the political, myth, and science subreddits respectively.
 
These represent the user polarities of these subreddits, on a range from 0% to 100%, where 0%
 
would mean that a user has not posted any comments within the subreddit, while 100% would
 
mean that all of a user’s comments are within one subreddit. Somewhere in the middle of this
 
spectrum, like a 40% percentage of intersection in the myth subreddit, would represent that 40%
 
of a user’s past posts were in myth subreddits. The other 60% of their posts can be found
 
distributed between the political and scientific subreddits. Thus, all polarities within each
 
subreddit category will add up to 100%, or all of a user’s past posts. The political (
​
Fig 1
​
) and
 
myth (
​
Fig 2)
​
 subreddits are quite similar in terms of their trend- they have a majority 0%
 
intersection among users, which means that many Reddit users have not ever posted in the
 
subreddits before. This wasn’t too surprising for the myth subreddits, as it is somewhat a smaller
 
community among Reddit users, since we looked into topics like Sasquatch, Bigfoot, and aliens.
 
However, we had predicted the opposite for the political subreddits. Because we had pulled data
 
from the months of March - June 2020, which happened to be right before the November
 
presidential election, we thought there would be more political discussion happening on this
 
platform. Perhaps we had chosen political subreddits that weren’t as mainstream for political
 discussion, or maybe political discussion is kept to other social media platforms like Twitter or
 
Facebook.
 
 
Meanwhile, the science (
​
Fig 3
​
) subreddit had the most versatile user base. There are more
 
users that are very loyal to the science subreddits than myth or political users. There were also
 
more of a variety of users, as you can see in the slight bump in the 60% region. This finding was
 
also somewhat surprising, as we had previously hypothesized there to be more of a normal
 
distribution rather than a bimodal distribution we see here. We had initially thought that because
 
scientific findings shouldn’t be too polarizing, there would be a variety of different users that
 
frequent other subreddits other than science subreddits.
 
 
Once we have obtained the user polarities, our next step is to visualize the aggregated
 
browsing patterns of the users we have collected to detect an echo chamber. For each possible
 
combination of two subreddits, we will record both the count and average polarities of the subset
 
of users participating in both. By calculating these metrics and visualizing them in a heatmap, we
 
can obtain a general sense of how likely followers of a certain subreddit are apt to follow,
 
comment in, and spread potentially misinformative ideas in another. We hypothesize that users
 
are more likely to follow subreddits aligning with their currently existing beliefs, and, given the
 
social and political tensions of the 2020 presidential election, that political misinformation will
 
spread faster than myth.
 
 
To generate the heatmap of shared users, we took the number of shared users between
 
any two subreddits, and divided by the total number, or union, of users between said subreddits.
 
This helped to account for the large user bases within the science subreddits, as opposed to the
 
myth subreddits.

Results and Analysis
  
Fig 4. Heatmap of shared users between any two subreddits
 
 
The colormap of Figure 4 has been rescaled for visibility purposes, as most subreddit
 
combinations had less than 10% of the same users. Regardless, we are able to make out three red
 
squares along the diagonal, each square confined our established subreddit types. Participants of
 
science subreddits will often visit their similar subreddits, while mostly staying out of our other
 
categories. Our outlier is a result of our scientific COVID-19 related subreddits crossing into the
 
conspiracy COVID-19 related subreddits.
 
  
Fig 5. Heatmap of Average Myth Polarity vs. Average Science Polarity
  
Fig 6. Heatmap of Average Political Misinformation Polarity vs. Science Polarity
 
Myth polarities in Figure 5 appear to peak when observing the common users of two
 
myth subreddits. The polarities taper off when comparing the user bases of a myth subreddit and
 
a non-myth subreddit, and colors are significantly lighter. Polarities reach their lowest when a
 
myth subreddit is not at all involved. The shared users of two political misinformation
 
subreddits, interestingly enough, seem to harbor the most myth subreddit users, although not by
 
much. In that sense, myth subreddits appear to be incredibly niche -- user bases with no
 
association to a myth subreddit will have a low polarity.
 
 
Figure 6, on the other hand, shows how much more easily political misinformation
 
spreads into other subreddits. Generally, Figure 6 follows a similar trend to Figure 5. Our highest
 
average polarity occurs in the shared user bases of two political subreddits, and the concentration
 of these users tapers off as politics are less and less involved. However, the average polarity of
 
any two non-political subreddits is significantly higher than that of the myth subreddits. This
 
subset of users, despite the supposed lack of association with political misinformation, has had a
 
remarkably high exposure to politically misinformative content.
 
 
It is clear that users of any one subreddit grouping tend to stay within that grouping, with
 
the exception of subreddits closely related in subject matter (i.e. COVID-19 misinformation
 
subreddits permeating into other COVID-19 subreddits). When these users do venture into other
 
subreddits, however, their ideas meet with varying reception. Myth subreddit users seem to stay
 
within their own group, and most other users will almost never participate in a myth subreddit.
 
Political misinformation, on the other hand, is noticeably diffusing into other subreddits. Perhaps
 
the longevity of urban legends can be attributed to the small but dedicated group surviving these
 
stories. Meanwhile, as “populations beset by social change and economic inequality are uniquely
 
susceptible to end-of-times conspiracy theories” 
​

​
, our results confirm that the stresses of the
 
pandemic and election have enabled a greater spread of political misinformation.

media
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
becomes
a
huge
and
important
part
of
people’s
daily
lives.
It
provides
mobile
users
a
convenient
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
way
to
connect
to
each
other
around
the
world
and
acquire
updated
and
trending
information
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
about
the
topic
of
Covid-19.
Besides,
people
can
also
express
their
thoughts
and
feelings
toward
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
certain
topics
by
posting
on
social
media.
Throughout
the
studying
of
this
quarter,
we
noticed
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that
there
are
a
number
of
posts
in
our
Twitter
dataset
that
are
related
to
the
topic
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Covid-19having
some
strong
emotions
and
sentiments.
In
the
meantime,
a
previous
study[1]
has
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
shown
that
more
people
are
experiencing
negative
emotions
such
as
anxiety
and
panic
under
this
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pandemic
period.
Therefore,
we
are
interested
in
analyzing
the
posts
that
are
related
to
the
topic
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
Covid-19
on
social
media
and
investigating
the
emotions
of
the
results
implied
in
these
posts
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
will lead to.
 
 
 
We
start
our
investigation
using
the
“Covid-19
tweets”
dataset
obtained
from
the
Panacea
Lab[3]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by
performing
sentiment
analysis
on
the
tweet
text.
Sentiment
analysis
and
opinion
mining
are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
useful
in
the
sense
that
it
contributes
to
the
understanding
of
human
emotions
by
observing
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
people’s
engagement
in
social
platforms.
Using
social
media,
we
are
able
to
monitor
the
user’s
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
feed
with
sentiment
analysis.
For
the
purpose
of
this
project,
we
expect
that
the
results
can
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
answer
the
potential
investigating
question:
“How
is
the
trend
of
daily
sentiment
related
to
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
change
in
the
number
of
daily
Covid-19
cases?”.
The
motivation
behind
this
question
is
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tweet
sentiments
can
be
analyzed
in
real-time
with
relatively
minor
effort,
but
​
Covid-19
case
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
data
requires
huge
amounts
of
human
and
economic
resources
to
obtain.
​
Studying
the
correlation
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
between
daily
cases
and
sentiment
features
can
provide
useful
insights
into
Covid-19’s
impact
on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
social media.
  
 
2  Datasets
 
 
2.1  Data Collection
 
There
are
three
datasets
obtained
for
this
project.
First,
we
used
the
dataset
which
includes
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
daily
Tweets
IDs
which
can
regenerate
tweets
about
the
Covid-19
from
March
22
to
November
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
30
(inclusive)
in
the
year
2020,
collected
by
the
Panacea
Lab
at
Georgia
State.
Then
we
sampled
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
at
a
rate
of
one
out
of
360
tweet
IDs
per
day
for
convenience
purposes.
On
this
subsampled
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dataset,
we
performed
the
Twitter
collection
process
by
using
the
Twitter
API
function
“twarc”
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
rehydrate
which
requests
the
full
tweet
content
based
on
the
tweet
IDs,
and
then
got
all
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tweets about the Covid-19.
 
 
 
After
obtaining
all
the
tweets
about
Covid-19
in
the
subsampled
dataset,
a
training
dataset
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
includes
similar
tweet
contents
with
sentiment
labels
will
be
required
in
order
to
build
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
prediction
models
for
sentiment
analysis
in
the
Covid-19
tweets
dataset.
We
then
found
a
dataset
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that
contains
1.6
million
training
data,
and
each
row
in
the
dataset
contains
the
text
of
a
tweet
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
a
sentiment
label,
which
the
text
variable
can
be
extracted
as
the
feature
and
sentiment
label
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as the output result to make predictions to sentiment.
 
 
In
order
to
observe
and
determine
the
significant
correlation
between
the
sentiment
in
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Covid-19
related
social
media
posts
and
the
numbers
of
disease
daily
cases,
we
obtained
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dataset
that
contains
daily
new
positive
cases
and
death
cases
all
over
the
world,
which
is
from
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Our World in Data
​
[4].
 
 
 
2.2  Data Processing and Cleaning
 
In
the
tweets
content
dataset
which
is
about
Covid-19,
we
extracted
“tweet_id”,
“text”,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“location”,
“retweeted_status”,
“hashtag”,
“follower_count”,
“date”,
and
“language”
from
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
raw
dataset,
and
we
also
adjusted
all
columns
to
a
suitable
format
and
saved
them
as
csv
files.
In
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
addition,
in
order
to
have
a
cleaner
version
of
the
tweet
text,
we
have
converted
all
the
text
into
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lowercase and removed all the punctuations, stopwords, and usernames contained in the tweets.
 
 
 
In
the
trained
sentiment
dataset,
we
only
extracted
“text”
and
“sentiment”
from
the
original
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dataset,
and
we
also
made
text
lowercase,
which
can
avoid
standardizing
the
same
words
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
different
formats.
Furthermore,
we
used
“-1”
to
represent
“negative”
sentiment
and
“1”
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“positive”,
which
is
easier
for
us
to
calculate
the
total
sentiment
score
during
the
14-day
period.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In
the
daily
cases
dataset,
we
extracted
cases
and
dates
and
removed
all
other
unrelated
columns.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In
addition,
in
the
Covid-19
daily
cases
dataset,
since
it
is
relatively
difficult
to
specify
the
region
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that
the
tweet
users
come
from,
we
then
summed
up
all
the
numbers
of
new
cases
around
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
world for 200 countries per day.

3  Data Analysis
 
3.1  Text Analysis
 
After
cleaning
the
text
in
the
Twitter
dataset,
we
have
performed
an
exploratory
data
analysis
on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
it.
By
calculating
the
term
frequency
and
Tf-Idf
throughout
these
Twitter
posts,
the
tables
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
frequencies
were
acquired
respectively.
We
noticed
that
these
two
vectorizers
gave
out
similar
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
results;
for
example,
the
three
most
frequent
terms
in
both
tables
are
“covid19”,
“coronavirus”,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
“trump”.
In
order
to
visually
compare
the
results,
a
graph
of
the
word
cloud
for
both
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vectorizers was generated as shown in Figures 1 and 2 below.

To
compare
the
daily
term
frequencies
and
the
counts
of
daily
​
Covid-19
cases,
we
tried
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
visualize
the
difference
between
trends
by
drawing
the
frequencies
of
specific
terms
by
dates
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
overlaid
the
plot
of
Covid-19
case
numbers.
After
intuitively
preselecting
the
words
“great”
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“sick”
(two
words
that
represent
positive
and
negative
sentiment),
two
graphs
are
generated
by
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
plotting
the
normalized
counts
of
terms
per
day
and
daily
case
numbers
from
March
22
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
November
30.
As
shown
in
Figures
3
and
4,
we
observed
that
there
are
no
direct
or
obvious
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
correlations between the trend of selected terms and the count of daily new cases.

4  Methodology and Result
 
4.1  Baseline Model: BERT Tokenizer & Logistic regression
 
Before
building
models,
we
need
to
tokenize
all
text
data
into
​
smaller
units
​
,
so
we
are
going
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
use
BERT
tokenizer
to
convert
the
whole
text
into
numerical
arrays.[1]
By
importing
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transformers
package,
we
used
the
“tokenizer”
function
to
convert
the
text
to
arrays
of
numbers
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
then
pad
different
arrays
to
the
max
length
and
convert
it
to
the
parse
matrix.
Then,
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
decided to use the logistic regression model as our baseline model to predict the sentiment of the
  
text
in
the
​
Covid-19
tweets
dataset,
and
we
first
got
a
base
accuracy
of
0.53,
which
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
well-grounded.
 
 
4.2  Advanced Model: CountVectorizer and SVC
 
Although
the
accuracy
of
the
baseline
logistic
regression
model
is
acceptable,
it
is
imprecise
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
us
to
predict
sentiment
for
the
​
Covid-19
tweets
dataset.
Therefore,
we
decided
to
build
the
SVC
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
model
as
the
advanced
model.
We
are
going
to
use
the
sklearn
function
“countvectorizer”
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
convert
text
to
a
vector
of
tokens,
which
can
help
us
to
use
the
resulting
matrix
as
input
to
put
it
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
into
the
model.
Then,
when
we
trained
an
SVC
model
with
default
parameter
values,
we
got
an
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
accuracy
of
0.56,
which
hasn't
reached
our
goal
yet.
Therefore,
in
order
to
improve
the
accuracy,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
we
did
some
parameter
tuning
to
the
SVC
model.
First,
we
loop
through
different
kernels
which
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
are
linear,
polynomial,
and
rbf.
From
figure
5,
we
find
that
the
SVC
model
using
linear
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hyperplane
achieves
over
75%
accuracy,
but
SVC
models
using
rbf
and
polynomial
hyperplane’s
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
accuracy
are
only
near
to
0.5.
Second,
we
also
loop
through
different
c
values
​
(the
penalty
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
parameter
of
the
error
term)
​
which
are
0.01,
0.1
and
1,
and
from
Figure
6,
we
can
find
that
when
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
c
value
equals
to
0.1,
the
model
reaches
the
highest
accuracy
which
is
0.7782.
Therefore,
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
decide
to
choose
the
SVC
model
with
linear
hyperplane
and
the
c
value
equals
0.1
as
the
final
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
advanced model which we will use to predict the sentiment for the 
​
Covid-19
​
 tweets dataset.

4.3  Analyzing Seasonality in Daily New Cases and Daily Tweet Sentiment
 
Our
first
step
is
to
detrend
the
daily
case
data.
As
we
can
see
in
the
graph,
the
daily
case
data
has
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
upward
mobility
which
is
the
result
of
multiple
factors
such
as
exponential
transmitting
rate.
Our
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sentiment
score
does
not
have
a
trend
in
the
long
run.
However,
both
of
the
data
have
a
seasonal
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
component
which
could
be
correlated.
To
detrend
the
data,
we
used
the
seasonal
decompose
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
module
to
locate
the
trends
and
use
regression
of
order
3
to
fit
the
shape
of
the
curve.
We
then
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subtracted
the
composition
from
the
original
data
to
obtain
a
flat
version
of
daily
cases
with
only
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the seasonality.
 
 
 
Figure 7: Daily Cases with Detrended Daily Cases
 
  
By
plotting
the
sentiment
data
with
the
detrended
data
we
can
see
that
they
do
have
similar
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fluctuations
in
the
first
three
months,
the
crest
and
trough
of
the
data
roughly
align
with
one
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
another.
Along
the
horizontal
axis,
we
noticed
that
the
time
series
match
less
and
less.
One
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
possible
reason
for
the
irregularities
in
later
periods
is
that
our
detrended
cases
daily
did
not
take
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
into
account
how
the
upward
trend
affect
the
magnitude
of
the
fluctuations.
With
the
increase
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cases
per
day,
the
scale
of
fluctuation
also
increases.
​
On
the
other
hand,
the
magnitude
of
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
seasonality in sentiment does not vary significantly[4].
 
 
 
Figure 8: Sentiment Score with Detrended Daily Cases
 
 
Due
to
the
nature
of
time-series
data,
we
are
not
exploring
the
causality
of
these
two
variables
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
since
they
can
easily
be
correlated
to
the
same
set
of
exogenous
factors
which
results
in
omitted
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
variable
problems.
Instead,
we
study
the
correlation
of
them
to
gain
insight
into
how
people's
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
moods
are
represented
by
social
media
affected
by
the
daily
COVID
cases.
We
first
calculated
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
Pearson
correlation
of
the
time
series
data
and
got
a
result
of
0.073.
The
cointegration
test
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a
statistical
technique
that
examines
if
two
time
series
are
integrated
together
at
a
specified
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
degree[5].
To
perform
this
test,
we
first
tested
the
stationarity
of
sentiment
score
and
detrended
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cases
using
the
Augmented
Dickey-Fuller
unit
root
test.
Both
of
them
produce
a
p-value
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
almost 0.
 
 
4.4  Frequency Decomposition
 
In
addition,
we
analyzed
the
seasonal
frequency
of
the
time
series.
Fourier
transformation
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
decomposes
a
function
of
time
into
temporal
frequencies.
We
performed
the
transformation
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
plotted
the
frequencies
for
two
separate
time
series.
Comparing
the
two
plots,
we
found
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Daily
cases
have
a
dominant
frequency
at
around
0.14.
Converting
to
days,
0.14
represents
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
approximately 7 days which suggests daily cases mainly oscillate weekly.

5  Result Summary and Discussion
 
After
model
evaluation
and
parameter
tuning,
we
adopted
the
SVC
model(c
=
0.1,
kernel
=
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
‘linear’)
with
an
accuracy
of
0.7782
and
used
it
to
predict
the
daily
sentiment
score
on
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Panacea dataset.
 
  
To
compare
the
time
series
of
daily
sentiment
scores
and
detrended
daily
cases,
we
plotted
them
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on
the
same
graph.
Although
we
observe
some
initial
correspondence
between
the
two
variables,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in
order
to
make
sure
they
are
statistically
significant,
we
conducted
multiple
tests
including
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pearson
Correlation,
​
Augmented
Dickey-Fuller
unit
root
test,
and
Fourier
transform.
We
used
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pearson
Correlation
to
get
an
approximate
idea
of
the
overall
correspondence
between
sentiment
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
daily
cases
since
the
test
is
subject
to
the
effect
of
noise
in
time
series.
A
score
of
0.073
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
would
suggest
a
weakly
positive
relationship
in
an
independent
context.
In
this
case,
both
of
our
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
data
are
dependent
on
time
which
makes
the
interpretation
subtle.
We
can
only
deduce
that
there
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is
no
strong
linear
relationship
between
Sentiment
Score
and
Detrended
Daily
Cases.
After
that,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
we
performed
cointegration
tests
which
check
whether
two
time
series
are
integrated
in
a
way
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that
does
not
change
in
the
long
run.
The
Augmented
Dickey-Fuller
unit
root
test
gives
both
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
time
series
a
near
0
p-value
which
suggests
that
we
should
reject
the
null
hypothesis
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
there
is
non-stationarity
in
the
data.
We
accept
the
alternative
hypothesis
that
our
data
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
stationary.
This
effectively
states
that
there
is
no
cointegration
between
the
two
since
both
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
them are stationary time series while cointegration only exists on non-stationary data.
 
 
Since
the
previous
two
tests
ruled
out
observable
relationships
between
our
variables.
We
studied
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
features
that
differentiate
them
by
using
Fourier
Transformation
which
decomposes
temporal
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
frequencies
out
of
time
series.
By
plotting
the
frequencies,
we
noticed
that
sentiment
score
has
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
no
dominant
frequency
while
daily
cases
have
one
at
0.14
which
corresponds
to
a
period
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
roughly
7
days.
This
could
explain
why
the
first
two
tests
do
not
find
a
strong
relationship
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
between
them.
If
the
frequency
of
the
two
does
not
coincide
with
each
other,
these
two
time
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
series
are
constantly
out
of
phase
which
results
in
low
statistical
significance
in
correlation.
The
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
weekly
period
of
the
daily
cases
is
likely
connected
to
the
reporting
mechanism.
For
example,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
some
facilities
may
choose
to
report
their
weekly
cases
on
Monday
instead
of
reporting
daily
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which
may
result
in
a
high
volume
of
cases
at
the
start
of
the
week.
The
sentiment
score
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
calculated
on
a
continuous
daily
basis,
the
discrepancy
resulted
in
different
oscillating
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
frequencies of the seasonality in daily cases and sentiment.
 
 
6  Conclusion
 
Covid-19,
as
one
of
the
biggest
problems
facing
humans
in
this
century,
has
affected
all
aspects
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
people’s
lives,
from
the
way
people
interact,
people’s
lifestyles,
to
social
media.
In
this
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
project,
we
investigated
the
relationship
between
tweet
sentiment
and
daily
cases.
Although
there
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is
an
observable
correspondence
between
sentiment
and
daily
cases
during
the
initial
phase
of
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pandemic.
Using
statistics
tools,
we
found
no
testable
statistically
significant
correlation
between
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sentiment
score
and
daily
cases.
Further
analysis
suggests
that
different
oscillating
frequency
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the seasonality between the two is one of the reasons for low correlation.

Abstract
 
There are “wars” going on every day online, but instead of cities, they are defending their
 
options and perspects. This phenomenon is especially common on the Wikipedia platform where
 
users are free to edit others' revisions. In fact, there are “about 12% of discussions are devoted to
 
reverts and vandalism, suggesting that the WP development process is highly contentious.”
 
(Robert 1) As Wikipedia has become a trusted source of information and knowledge which is
 
freely accessible, It is important to investigate how editors collaborate and controvert each other
 
in such a platform. This paper will discuss a new method of measuring controvisality in
 
Wikipedia articles. We have found out that controversiality is highly related to the number of
 
revert edits, the sentiment level among one article comments, and the view counts of that article.
 
Thus we developed a weighted sum formula, which combines those three factors to accurately
 
measure the controversy level within articles in Wikipedia.

Introduction
 
Wikipedia is now a trusted source of information and knowledge which is freely accessible.
 
Since it has become such an important resource, its information quality needs to be monitored for
 
providing more accurate sources to readers. Thus, it is important to look at how Wikipedia
 
information is generated and how people make changes to Wikipedia information. Investigating
 
this allows us to gage the trustworthiness of Wikipedia articles and allows for the discovery of
 
methods to collaborate more efficiently.
 
 
 
Our project is built on a previous paper called
​
 
​
Edit wars in Wikipedia
​
 which investigates a
 
similar topic. The paper believes that analyzing revisions is a good way to build an
 
understanding of an article's controversy 
​
since a reversion erases the work of a user and mutually
 
doing it between editors is a good indicator that they disagree enough not to be able to work this
 
problem out through other channels. Their measurement of controversy, known as the
 
“M-statistic”, is calculated in the following way: for every revision, check to see if there is a
 
revert. For each revert, they take the min amount of user edits out of the following 2 categories:
 
1) the person that reverted the article 2) the person that was reverted. This min amount is then
 
summed across all reverts (excluding the top 2 users). This amount is multiplied by the number
 
of users. However, we found out that M-statistics fails to reflect the controversy level accurately
 
within non-popular articles, which consists nearly 95% of all the articles in Wikipedia. In fact,
 
we found out 99% of articles have a 0 M statistic, which means either there is no evidence of
 
controversy at all or the M-score cannot detect the controversy in those articles. According to our
 
analysis, the shortcomes of M statistic are as follows:
 
  
Xingyu, Xiangchen, Hengyu 4
 
First, M statistics does not look deeper into each revert. For example, a revert could be made
 
because the reverted edit is wrong, or because of vandalism, or even could be an outcome by
 
bots’ routine work. M statistic will tread a revert equally regardless of its reason. Secondly, by
 
only using the number of mutual reverts and the number of people who make mutual reverts as a
 
way to evaluate the controversy, it misses a lot of parts in Wikipedia articles that may also
 
contain some contents that can directly show you this article has a high level of controversy,
 
such as some negative revision content, pageview counts for articles and etc.
 
 
 
Thus it inspires us to generate a more accurate weighted sum formula by including M statistic,
 
sentiment analysis of comments, article pageview counts to evaluate the controversy of
 
Wikipedia articles. By including these additional factors, we wish our final formula could
 
perform better within non-popular articles (where M statistic is 0), and largely maintain the
 
accuracy of controversy level within popular articles.
 
 
 
Background
 
 
Wikipedia articles are a great free accessible data source that people use to find information they
 
need. And this feature also lets Wikipedia articles become a source for letting people make
 
research. For example, there is research that is trying to explore areas of collaboration that result
 
in quality content, Shane Greenstein and Feng Zhu, authors of “
​
Do Experts or Crowd- based
 
Models Produce More Bias?
​
”, 
​
looked at the differences between “expert” opinions and
 
Wikipedia articles bias
​
, found that articles with more revisions tended to be more neutral;
 
however, it’s effect on bias is not strong and many articles do not undergo that many revisions.
 
Also, there is another research that is related to the Wikipedia article and the result from Shane
  
Xingyu, Xiangchen, Hengyu 5
 
Greenstein and Feng Zhu’s paper. In Kittur and Kraunt’s paper, “Harnessing the Wisdom of
 
Crowds in Wikipedia: Quality Through Coordination”, they used people’s evaluations of quality
 
(through mechanical turks) and Wikipedia’s own article assessment project as a measurement,
 
and they found that more editors working with certain amounts of implicit coordination led to the
 
most quality results (however, just adding more editors did not necessarily mean an increase in
 
quality). We also think it is pretty interesting to make analysis on Wikipedia articles, which lets
 
us generate the idea to analyze the controversy of Wikipedia articles.
 
 
Datasets and Methods
 
Raw Edit History Dump:
 
The first dataset is an edit with comments dump file, we get this dataset from the raw XML file.
 
The data looks like this:
 
 
Figure 1: 
​
detailed information about edit with comments dump file
 
  
Xingyu, Xiangchen, Hengyu 6
 
In this dataset, it contains the commenter names, titles of articles that they make comments on,
 
and the time for them to make any comments in Wikipedia articles. Besides those columns, it
 
also contains a column named “
​
comment
​
”, which is the content of those commenters’ comments.
 
For this dataset, we mainly want to get the 
​
comment 
​
column, which we will use in our sentiment
 
analysis part to analyze the sentiment score for each comment. Later on, we will discuss how to
 
use comments to detect the level of controversy within one article. Overall we believe that
 
sentiment score can be an important factor in our weighted sum formula to calculate the extent of
 
controversy for Wikipedia articles. Also, we generate both columns named as “
​
commentator
​
”
 
and “
​
time
​
” for merging this dataset with the English Light Dump file.
 
 
 
Note that the entire edit history for all Wikipedia articles is huge and beyond our parse ability.
 
This project will only use 2600 articles and their entire edit history (around 30GB). Our data
 
processing pipeline will automatically download the selected bz2 file and read the xml line by
 
line to extract the necessary data fields (Contributor name, comments, etc.).
 
 
 
English Light Dump:
 
The second dataset is English light Dump file, we get this dataset from 
​
WikiWarMonitor
​
. The
 
dataset looks like this:
 
  
Xingyu, Xiangchen, Hengyu 7
 
 
Figure 2: 
​
detailed information about English Light Dump dataset
 
 
This dataset is generated to calculate M statistic which contains 
​
“date”, “linelabel”,
 
“revised_time”, “commentor”, “article”
​
 columns. For the “
​
linelabel”
​
 column (we will call it
 
“
​
revert
​
” later), it shows whether some parts of the article are reverted by others. And for the
 
revised_time
​
 column, it shows the number of revisions for the article. We use this dataframe to
 
merge with the edit with comment dataset and get a dataframe that contains all of their
 
information. Also, we use this dataframe to get an 
​
M-score
​
 for each article, because we think
 
although the 
​
M-score
​
 is not so accurate, it is still an important part of our weighted sum formula.
 
 
 
Pageview API:
 
The third dataset we are using is a dataset generated from the Pageview API. The dataset looks
 
like the following figure:
 
  
Xingyu, Xiangchen, Hengyu 8
 
 
Figure 3: 
​
detailed information about Pageview dataset
 
 
This dataset only contains two columns: For the 
​
“title”
​
 column, it contains the name for each
 
Wikipedia article. The 
​
“view”
​
 column is generated by “title” columns by getting the raw
 
description number of views from the article’s start date to January 1st, 2021 from the Pageview
 
API. The reason for us to generate such a dataset is we think pageview counts can be related with
 
the controversy of Wikipedia articles. In other words, we think if an article has large pageview
 
counts, it should have a higher level of controversy.
 
 
 
Sentiment Analysis on Comments
 
When we examine the entire edit history of one article, We noticed every time an editor gives a
 
revision, he may leave a comment on what is being revised, which is also a perfect place to
 
defend his edit or attack others (figure 4). In order to get the general sentiment statistic for a
 
certain article, we need to run sentiment analysis on every edit comment of one article. Then we
  
Xingyu, Xiangchen, Hengyu 9
 
hypothesize that: Bringing in sentiment score could balance M’s performance in lower M score
 
range.
 
 
Figure 4:
​
 
​
Example of an edit comment
 
 
Here is an example that shows the importance of adding sentiment analysis into our controversy
 
measurement. We had found an article “Wooster, Ohio”, who has 0 M statistic, but we still
 
detect heavy sentiment inside its comments (see figure 5). This histograms shows even if its M
 
statistic is 0 (leftmost bar), half of its comments consists of a certain degree of sentiment
​
1
​
. That
 
shows some validity of why sentiment analysis should be considered when measuring
 
controversy.
 
 
 
1
 The sentiment score for each comment is within [-1,1]. Here we take the absolute value of each score to
 
measure the intensity level of sentiment.
 
  
Xingyu, Xiangchen, Hengyu 10
 
Figure 5:
​
 Sentiment distribution of 
​
Wooster, Ohio
 
Next, we apply this analysis with all our available data
​
2
​
. We plot the scatter plot (figure 6) where
 
its x-axis is the log scaled M statistic and y-axis is the mean sentiment score. If we ignore the
 
dots in the green circle, we will notice there is a good positive correlation between M and
 
sentiment score, which prove that sentiment score and M are both good reflections of
 
controversy in the range. However, when we look at the dots in the green circle, we found that
 
even if they are low in M score, they still vary in sentiment level. This is why we want to use
 
sentiment scores to compensate for M's performance in low M region.
 
 
 
Figure 6: 
​
M and Sentiment Score
 
 
Note that in this graph, we use the mean absolute sentiment score instead of the total absolute
 
sentiment score of each article to reflect the overall sentiment intensity among all the edits.
 
However, we noticed some articles which should be considered as more controversial (such as
 
the 
​
Republican Party
​
) have an usual average sentiment. This is due to the large amount of edits
 
2
 Our dataset consists of a total of 2600 articles with their entire edit history, most of which are related to
 
Ohio State.
 
  
Xingyu, Xiangchen, Hengyu 11
 
as a denominator that makes the mean much smaller. Thus sentiment score will only perform
 
well when that article’s corresponding M is small.
 
 
 
Pageview Count and Controversy
 
The view count of an article normally decides the popularity of that article: The higher view
 
counts means higher popularity. Thus we further hypothesize that may be higher view counts
 
could also mean that the article is more controversial. We decided to use our two existing factors
 
to validate this hypothesis: Sentiment score and M statistic.
 
 
 
Because articles with 0 M statistics consist of 90% of our dataset, we remove all these articles to
 
make the trend more visible. We also log scaled our M statistic and view counts
 
 
 
Figure 7:
​
 View Counts and M Statistic
Figure 8: 
​
View Counts and Sentiment Score
 
 
From figure 7, we can see there is positive correlation between the view counts and M statistic,
 
which validates our hypothesis. However, as for the correlation between sentiment score and
 
view couts (figure 8), although there is a positive correlation shown in the graph, we should note
 
that x-axis is the sum of the sentiment score of all comments instead of the average sentiment
 
score. This is because the problem of unusual edits counts when the article is very popular.
 
However, this is just to validate the hypothesis for view counts. When generating the final
  
Xingyu, Xiangchen, Hengyu 12
 
measurement (The weighted sum formula), we still use the mean sentiment score because we try
 
to make the sentiment score perform better in the low M region.
 
 
 
Weighted Sum Formula
 
After the above analysis, we generate our final weighted sum formula:
 
 
The level of controversiality = (Mean revert + Mean sentiment score)*log(View counts) +
 
Log(M statistic)
 
 
Using this formula, we plot and compare the statistic line with the original measurement (M
 
statistic), and find out
​
 the most improvement is we successfully make the slope smoother
​
 (see
 
figure 9
​
3
​
). Although there is still a steep decrease within top 5% articles, we considered this more
 
likely to be a feature in Wikipedia that most articles are relatively “boring” than a drawback of
 
our measurement.
 
 
 
Figure 10,9:
​
 Comparison of old (left) and new (right) measurements
 
We can see a better version of measurement for controversiality has successfully been generated.

 Consider these two figures are one-dimensional, because the x-axis has no real meaning which just
 
shows articles’ ID in descending order by level of controversy.
 
  
Xingyu, Xiangchen, Hengyu 13
 
Ours successfully detects controversy among “boring” articles while maintaining the M’s
 
performance within popular articles.
 
 
 
Conclusion and Constraint
 
 
Overall our biggest success is to smooth the statistic line to make the controversy level for
 
“boring” articles also visible and comparable. We first hypothesize and prove the validity of
 
sentiment score, pageview and revert’s correlation with the real controversy level. Then we
 
combine those factors to weigh the controversy accurately in both popular articles and relatively
 
low controversial articles.
 
 
 
However, there are also constraints within those factors. First we use the “Vader“ sentiment
 
model to measure the sentiment in each comment, but that model is not specifically built for the
 
Wikipedia platform. Words such as “revert” ,”touch” are not detected as negative words as they
 
should. Second, there is a small percentage of overlap between mean reverts and M, because M
 
is calculated by the number of “mutual reverts”, which is a subset of all reverts. Yet we have not
 
considered the influence of counting the intersection twice.
 
 
 
Future work
 
 
Looking through our project, you can get a new calculation method on defining the controversy
 
of Wikipedia articles. After making those analyses on our weighted sum formula, it lets us know
 
that there are still more things we can do in the future to let our work become better.
 
 
  
Xingyu, Xiangchen, Hengyu 14
 
Firstly, we use limited data sources to finish our research. Specifically, the website called
 
Wikimedia Data Archives contains all the edit history of Wikipedia
​
. However, because of our
 
limited hardware ability and the efficiency of our codes, we can only use 5 files in such large
 
size. This may reduce the accuracy of our weighted sum formula. So, in the future, we want to
 
get all of the edits with comments dump files from Wikimedia Data Archives to improve our
 
analysis. With such support of having all edits with comments dump files, it can let us have more
 
articles and more data related to those articles to make analysis. For example, our sentiment
 
score for each article will be more accurate because each article will have all the comments they
 
should have. So by doing this improvement in the future, it will let our weighted sum formula
 
become more accurate for the articles in English Wikipedia area.
 
 
 
Secondly, besides just looking at the English Wikipedia articles, we can let our weighted sum
 
formula become more adaptive for other Wikipedia articles. In other words, for each Wikipedia
 
source, we can generate a weighted sum formula for that. And finally, we can have multiple
 
formulas for detecting the controversy of articles in different sources. This may help us when we
 
want to analyze other Wikipedia sources.
 
 
 
Third, there are also many possible EDAs (Exploratory Data Analysis) we should do to fully test
 
the performance of our new formula. For example, we could split the score into a vector and
 
aggregate articles by each factor to see each factor’s performance and compare the difference in
 
each article group. Such EDAs are going to help us further understand and improve the formula
 
in the future.

Abstract
 
 
Fan
communities
exist
within
every
industry,
and
there
has
been
little
study
on
understanding
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
their
scale
and
how
they
influence
the
media
and
their
industries.
As
technology
and
social
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
media
have
made
it
easier
than
ever
for
fans
to
connect
with
their
favorite
influencers
and
find
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
like-minded
fans,
we’ve
seen
a
rise
in
fan
culture
or
“fandom”.
These
individuals
form
fan
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
groups
and
communities,
which
have
become
increasingly
popular
online
and
have
rallied
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
behind
their
favorite
artists
for
different
causes.
In
recent
years,
K-pop
has
taken
the
music
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
industry
by
storm,
quickly
rising
to
global
significance
and
gathering
some
of
the
most
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dedicated fanbases in the world.
 
 
We
explore
the
similarities
and
differences
in
collaboration
efforts
among
fans
of
three
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
popular
artists,
BTS,
Taylor
Swift,
and
Justin
Bieber
on
two
primary
online
social
platforms,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Twitter
and
Wikipedia.
We
present
a
new
method
to
quantify
the
strength
and
influence
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
online
fan
communities—with
a
focus
on
the
BTS
fanbase—and
how
this
online
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
collaboration affects outside audiences.

Introduction
 
 
The
digital
age
has
completely
transformed
the
accessibility
of
information,
allowing
people
from
every
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
walk
of
life
to
find
online
communities
for
any
topic
of
inquiry.
With
the
internet
available
at
everyone’s
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fingertips,
sharing
information
with
people
you
otherwise
may
never
have
connected
with
is
easier
than
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ever. This helps lead to levels of collaboration that surpass prior non-digital efforts.
 
 
Historically,
there
have
been
a
number
of
social
movements
centered
around
music
that
have
gone
on
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
influence
large-scale
political
and
societal
change
through
extensive
collaboration
by
fan
communities.
In
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
1960s,
we
saw
the
rise
of
counterculture
and
the
use
of
music
as
a
mode
of
protest
and
organization.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
With
the
1980s
came
the
rise
of
punk
rock
and
punk
culture,
a
subculture
that
united
the
working
class
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
under
music
to
fight
against
establishment
inequality.
In
today’s
high-tech
world,
we
expect
the
presence
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and power of such motivated communities to be magnified.
 
 
This
is
evident
in
one
of
the
largest,
most
visible
fanbases
today,
the
Korean
pop
(K-pop)
fandom—a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
super
community
composed
of
fans
of
numerous
K-pop
groups
such
as
BTS,
Blackpink,
and
Girl’s
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Generation.
It
is
estimated
that
the
K-pop
stan
community
has
roughly
100
million
people,
with
BTS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ARMY,
fans
of
BTS,
the
most
popular
K-pop
group,
making
up
50
million
alone
[1].
It’s
an
international
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
phenomenon
how
a
singular
K-pop
group
is
able
to
unite
all
their
fans
across
multiple
countries,
language
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
barriers, and age differences.
 
 
1.1
Background: K-pop as an Online Community and “Hashtag Takeovers”
 
 One
of
the
most
notable
demonstrations
of
the
influence
of
the
K-pop
fanbase
occurred
on
Twitter
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
early
June
2020
after
the
police
killing
of
George
Floyd
and
the
nationwide
Black
Lives
Matter
protests.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The
hashtag
#WhiteLivesMatter,
a
phrase
popularized
by
white
supremacist
groups
such
as
the
Ku
Klux
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Klan
and
the
Aryan
Renaissance
Society,
was
trending
as
a
counter-response
to
the
Black
Lives
Matter
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
movement, attempting to sideline the discussion on police brutality and instead promote a culture of hate.
 
 
K-pop
fans
discovered
the
hateful
posts
and
weaponized
their
enormous
social
media
presence
to
flood
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
#WhiteLivesMatter
as
well
police
report
app
iWatch
Dallas,
which
had
requested
Twitter
users
submit
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“video
of
illegal
activity
from
the
[Black
Lives
Matter]
protests”,
with
“fancams”,
fan-edits
of
their
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
favorite
artists,
to
drown
out
racist
content
in
support
of
Black
Lives
Matter
[2].
Within
hours,
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
#WhiteLivesMatter
hashtag
and
the
Dallas
Police
Department
iWatch
Dallas
app
was
flooded
with
K-pop
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
content in order to protest white supremacy and police brutality [3].
 
 
To
further
explore
this,
we
scraped
public
tweets
posted
between
May
31,
2020
and
June
6,
2020
tagged
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with
#WhiteLivesMatter.
Due
to
rate
limitations,
we
were
only
able
to
collect
6,000
tweets,
about
a
10%
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sample
of
the
total
tweets
using
the
hashtag.
In
our
initial
manual
review,
we
noticed
that
posts
by
non
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
White
Lives
Matter
supporters
tended
to
include
media
such
as
the
aforementioned
“fancams”
or
other
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
content
unrelated
to
the
hashtag.
We
then
cross-checked
the
following
lists
of
each
user
who
had
posted
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
using
#WhiteLivesMatter
to
see
if
they
were
following
any
K-pop
related
accounts,
such
as
the
BTS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
official Twitter.
 
 
 
From
this,
we
plotted
the
distribution
of
tweets
containing
#WhiteLivesMatter
posted
by
K-pop
followers
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
against
the
total
number
of
tweets
using
the
hashtag
and
the
number
of
tweets
with
both
the
hashtag
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
media content.

 #WhiteLivesMatter Tweet Distribution of Sample Tweets
 
 
More
recently,
K-pop
fans
have
utilized
their
fan
network
once
again
to
take
over
hashtags
in
a
similar
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fashion,
such
as
#ImpeachBidenNow
and
#AOCLied
hashtags
in
the
first
two
months
of
2021.
The
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 continued
efforts
of
these
fans
demonstrate
how
the
K-pop
community
and
their
dedication
to
both
their
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
idols and social justice are here to stay.
 
 
Two
days
after
President
Biden’s
inauguration
on
January
20,
2021,
Republican
Representative
Marjorie
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Green
announced
that
she
had
filed
articles
of
impeachment
on
President
Biden,
sparking
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
#ImpeachBidenNow.
Though
the
hashtag
was
trending
with
nearly
100,000
tweets,
examining
the
tweets
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
revealed
that
the
hashtag
had
been
taken
over
by
K-pop
fans
and
flooded
with
K-pop
content.
Roughly
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
one
week
later,
on
February
1st,
detractors
created
#AOCLied,
a
targeted
harassment
campaign
against
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Representative
Alexandria
Oscasio-Cortez,
better
known
as
AOC.
The
K-pop
community
was
quick
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
retaliate,
overwhelming
the
hashtag
within
the
day
with
photos
of
their
pets
and
favorite
icons
as
well
as
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
messages of support for AOC.
 
 
In
their
article
regarding
the
#ImpeachBidenNow
takeover,
Variety
Magazine
commented
“Apparently,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
GOP
still
has
not
learned
what
many
web
editors
know
all
too
well
from
experience:
K-pop
fans
do
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
not
play
around.”,
reiterating
the
scale
and
impact
that
the
K-pop
fandom
has
online
and
affirming
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
their
presence
is
well-known
and
acknowledged
by
the
media
and
other
online
communities.
According
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a
K-pop
fan
on
Twitter,
“when
[fans]
don’t
like
what
a
tag
is
trending
for,
we
unite
and
purposely
spam
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
overtake it”.
 
 
 
K-pop’s
remarkable
rise
and
global
impact
bring
up
the
questions
of:
how
can
we
effectively
quantify
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compare
collaboration
among
fan
groups
on
different
online
platforms?
What
distinguishes
K-pop
fans’
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
collaborative movements from others?
 
 
1.2
Hypothesis
 
 
As
a
whole,
online
platforms
have
enabled
the
quick
spread
of
information
among
its
users
across
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
globe.
This
allows
social
media
platforms
such
as
Twitter
to
utilize
their
network
of
users
to
organize
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
endogenous
attempts
of
collaboration.
However,
perhaps
these
large-scale,
unusual
collaborative
products
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conducted
by
K-pop
fans
on
Twitter
don’t
happen
in
other
collaboration-driven
platforms,
such
as
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Wikipedia.
Collaborative
edits
on
Wikipedia
are
often
driven
by
external
factors
and
events,
and
thus
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
capture a very different type of collaboration as compared to Twitter.
 
 
How
does
the
degree
of
collaboration
among
K-pop
fans
compare
with
that
of
other
fanbases?
To
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
understand
the
strength
and
scale
of
the
K-pop
fanbase,
we
will
quantify
online
fan
participation
on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Twitter
and
Wikipedia,
and
compare
them
to
participation
by
other
fanbases,
such
as
Swifties,
during
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
album release periods.
 
 
In
2020
and
the
first
two
months
of
2021,
we’ve
seen
the
online
K-pop
community
unite
to
accomplish
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
common
goal,
from
activism
to
getting
their
favorite
group’s
new
song
to
the
Billboard
100,
K-pop
fans
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have
made
themselves
a
well-known
internet
force.
Given
what
we
know
about
K-pop
fans
and
their
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
numerous
collaborative
efforts,
we
expect
to
see
that
​
K-pop
fans’
participation
in
online
collaborative
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
efforts
largely
outscales
other
music
industry
fan
participation,
masterfully

Background and Data
 
 
We
primarily
explored
the
online
presence
and
activity
of
BTS
fans
compared
to
that
of
two
popular
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Western
artists,
Taylor
Swift
and
Justin
Bieber.
Over
the
years,
both
Swift
and
Bieber
have
developed
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
devoted
fanbases,
who
identify
themselves
as
Swifties
and
Beliebers
respectively.
For
the
purposes
of
this
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
analysis,
we
used
BTS
fans
as
a
proxy
for
K-pop
fans
in
general
as
BTS
ARMY
are
the
largest
subgroup
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of the K-pop community at 50 million strong.
 
 
BTS
is
the
youngest
musically
of
the
three
artists,
debuting
in
2013
with
their
album
release
in
2014.
In
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
comparison,
Swift
and
Bieber
released
their
first
albums
in
2006
and
2010
respectively.
Before
BTS
even
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
began
to
emerge,
Swift
and
Bieber
had
already
established
well-known
and
dedicated
fanbases.
By
2014,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Swift
had
already
released
four
albums,
with
her
fifth
album
​
1989
releasing
that
year,
and
Bieber
had
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
released
three
albums.
Despite
this,
BTS
has
quickly
risen
to
worldwide
significance,
drawing
756,000
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
viewers
for
a
paid
virtual
concert
in
June
2020
[6]
breaking
a
world
record
for
online
concert
attendance,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
again
in
October
2020
with
an
audience
size
of
approximately
993,000
for
their
two
day
digital
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concert
series
[6;
7].
We
expect
to
see
more
extensive
fan
participation
and
collaboration
from
BTS
fans,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
especially for their latest album.
 
 
We
specifically
focused
on
the
period
prior
to
and
following
an
album
release
due
to
increased
fan
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
participation
from
new
content.
Fans
can
share
their
first
impressions
of
the
new
album
and
spread
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
word
about
new
music,
hoping
to
push
their
artist’s
music
to
popular
record
charts
such
as
the
Billboard
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hot
100
Song.
To
account
for
technical
and
social
developments,
such
as
the
rise
of
Twitter’s
popularity,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
we
chose
albums
from
each
artist
that
were
released
roughly
around
the
same
time.
By
comparing
these
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
three
artists
and
fan
participation
levels
during
three
of
their
releases,
we
gain
a
more
quantified
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
understanding of the social impact of musical fanbases online.
 
 
We
started
with
the
first
album
released
by
BTS,
​
Dark
&
Wild
​
,
in
2014
and
then
chose
alternating
albums
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
account
for
fanbase
growth
and
artist
maturity.
For
BTS,
we
only
selected
their
Korean
language
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
albums due to their popularity over BTS’s Japanese language albums.

Data Sources
 
 
For
a
wider
scope
of
fan
activity
and
artist
popularity,
we
explored
three
different
online
platforms:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Google
Trends,
Twitter,
and
Wikipedia
​
.
To
collect
data,
we
set
a
timeframe
of
two
days
prior
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
twelve
days
following
each
album
release
to
help
visualize
the
climate
leading
up
to
and
following
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
release and scraped data for each platform and time period.
 
 
Google
Trends
was
our
baseline
platform;
from
this,
we
were
able
to
gauge
the
general
interest
the
public
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
had
regarding
each
album
at
the
time
of
its
release.
Unlike
the
other
platforms,
engaging
with
Google
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Trends requires no additional active effort, giving us an overview of interest from fans and non-fans alike.
 
 
Our
first
platform
for
collaboration,
Twitter,
is
perhaps
the
most
actively
collaborative
social
platform
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
today.
By
pulling
together
tweets
at
the
time
of
each
album
release,
we
were
able
to
obtain
metrics
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
multiple
levels
of
collaboration:
likes,
retweets,
replies,
and
original
tweets,
listed
in
the
order
of
the
level
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of effort required to engage in from least to most.
 
 
To
analyze
an
even
greater
investment
for
collaboration,
we
reviewed
Wikipedia
revision
history.
Unlike
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Twitter,
which
requires
a
more
casual
level
of
effort
for
participation,
fans
who
edit
on
Wikipedia
have
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enough interest and extensive domain knowledge to contribute to an encyclopedia article for their artist.
 
 
These
data
sources
give
us
multiple
facets
for
collaboration
to
compare
with
varying
levels
of
required
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
commitment, from easiest (Twitter likes) to hardest (Wikipedia revisions).

Methods and Analyses
 
 
 
3.1
Google Trends
 
 
Google
Trends,
a
website
by
Google,
analyzes
the
popularity
of
search
queries
inputted
into
Google’s
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
search
engine
over
a
given
period
of
time
for
various
locations
and
languages.
The
data
is
an
unbiased
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sample
of
Google
search
data
that
is
anonymized,
categorized,
normalized,
and
aggregated
to
the
time
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
location
of
a
query.
Google
Trends
can
be
filtered
into
five
different
search
types:
web,
image,
news,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Google
Shopping,
and
YouTube.
For
our
purposes,
we
will
focus
on
web
search
due
to
its
larger
scale
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
more
inclusive
nature.
Additionally,
search
data
can
be
filtered
by
category,
such
as
“Arts
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Entertainment”
and
“News”.
To
count
for
potential
spam,
the
Google
Trends
algorithm
filters
out
specific
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
types of searches such as repeated searches by the same person over a short time period.
 
 
Google
Trends
then
computes
and
outputs
a
scaled
popularity
score
on
a
range
of
0
to
100,
with
100
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
being
the
maximum
possible
search
interest,
by
comparing
the
volume
of
the
term’s
searches
to
the

Changes
 
February 14, 2020
 overall
volume
of
site
searches
for
the
set
period
and
geography.
The
search
data
is
indexed
depending
on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
time
period,
and
a
term’s
relative
popularity
might
change
as
a
result.
Similarly,
the
interest
statistics
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
are
also
dependent
on
how
the
search
is
section;
a
general
search
may
produce
different
results
than
an
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Arts and Entertainment related search.
 
 
When
we
see
a
“spike”
in
popularity,
this
means
that
we
see
a
rapid
increase
in
search
interest
of
a
given
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
term
compared
to
previous
interest.
To
understand
the
actual
scale
of
a
term’s
popularity,
we
use
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
additional terms, in this case, two other artists, to add context to the interest levels.
 
 
We
first
explored
data
using
the
web-based
dashboard
to
get
a
basic
overview
of
search
trend
popularity
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for
our
albums
and
artists
and
later
utilized
the
Python
API
​
pytrends
​
to
automate
report
downloads.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For
our
search
terms,
we
specifically
used
the
artist
topic
to
include
all
search
terms
related
to
our
artists
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
set
the
region
to
worldwide
to
see
the
artists’
global
relevance,
especially
as
two
are
Western
artists
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
the
third
is
a
K-pop
artist.
Originally,
we
narrowed
our
search
to
the
“Arts
and
Entertainment”
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
category, but later expanded to all categories as a whole, our “general search”.
 
 
First,
we
examined
the
interest
over
time
for
each
artist
since
2004
for
both
our
Arts
and
Entertainment
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
search
and
our
general
search.
Our
search
data
is
indexed
monthly;
the
popularity
of
an
artist
is
averaged
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for
each
month
from
January
2004
to
March
2021.
March
2021
is
incomplete
due
to
the
ongoing
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
collection of search data throughout the month. The data used included information up to March 3, 2021.
 
 
When
plotting
both
our
Arts
and
Entertainment
and
general
search,
we
see
that
BTS
has
had
a
steadier
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
increase
in
interest
compared
to
Swift
or
Bieber,
who
became
“overnight
sensations”
and
had
a
large
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
spike
in
interest
during
their
early
career.
On
our
Arts
and
Entertainment
plot,
it
appears
that
Taylor
Swift
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
Justin
Bieber
are
on
a
downtrend
in
popularity,
with
interest
spikes
during
album
releases,
after
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
peaking
in
the
early-mid
2000/2010s,
with
BTS
overtaking
Bieber
in
popularity
around
August
2018.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Currently,
all
three
artists
have
approximately
the
same
level
of
Arts
and
Entertainment
interest,
with
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Swift having a slight lead over BTS and Bieber at the bottom of the three.
 
 
 
Figure 3:
​
 Monthly Google Trends Arts and Entertainment Search Interest since 2004
  
Our
general
search
plot
shows
a
lower
general
interest
rate
for
Taylor
Swift
and
an
increased
interest
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Justin
Bieber
and
BTS.
However,
this
plot
shows
a
sharper
decline
in
popularity
for
Bieber
and
higher
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
increase
for
BTS
in
comparison
to
the
Arts
and
Entertainment
trends.
In
general
trends,
BTS
passed
Swift
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
Bieber
in
search
interest
around
September
2016
and
November
2017
respectively
and
is
continuing
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
rise.
Despite
Swift
and
Bieber’s
established
popularity,
newcomer
BTS
was
able
to
unseat
both
of
these
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
popular Western artists in general search interest before the release of their second album.
 
 
 
Figure 4:
​
 Monthly Google Trends General Search Interest since 2004
 
 
In
the
category-specific
approach,
we
see
that
both
Western
artists
have
more
search
interest
on
average
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in
relation
to
all
Arts
and
Entertainment
searches.
This
establishes
Swift
as
the
most
relevant
artist,
with
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
an
average
interest
of
25.8,
with
Bieber
following
behind
at
18.17
and
BTS
with
a
notably
lower
average
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
at
3.64.
In
contrast,
when
we
examine
the
general
search,
Bieber
leads
in
interest
with
an
average
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
popularity
of
23.35
compared
to
BTS’s
13.74
and
Swift’s
13.12.
Interestingly,
experimenting
with
other
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
categories,
such
as
the
more
specific
“Music
&
Audio”
or
the
general
“News”,
gives
us
different
results
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for the same artists during the same time periods.

Alongside
search
popularity,
Google
Trends
also
provides
the
top
related
search
terms
and
topics.
We
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
analyzed
all
related
queries
since
2004,
tokenizing
each
word
from
each
term
and
removing
stop
words.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
From
this,
we
found
that
BTS
related
searches
most
commonly
reference
album
titles,
song
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lyrics/translations,
and
music
awards;
Taylor
Swift
related

reference
album
titles
and

lyrics,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
Justin

reference
song
lyrics
and
other
individuals,
most
notably
Selena

and James Corden.

Twitter
 
 
 
Twitter
is
a
popular
social
networking
service,
known
for
its
titular
“tweets”,
short
250
character
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
messages
that
users
can
post,
share
and
interact
with
through
likes,
retweets,
and
replies.
To
obtain
our
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Twitter
data,
we
used
the
Python
API
​
twint
to
scrape
tweets
without
the
limitations
of
the
official
API,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which
only
allows
for
scraping
up
to
seven
days
before
the
usage
date.
We
determined
“relevant”
tweets
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
during
the
aforementioned
time
periods
by
scraping
Twitter
for
two
hashtags
per
album:
the
most
popular
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
artist
hashtag
and
the
most
popular
album
hashtag.
For
example,
for
BTS’s
first
album
​
Dark
&
Wild
​
,
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
scraped all tweets that contained the “query” hashtags 
​
#BTS 
​
and 
​
#DarkAndWild 
​
during the time period.
 
 
 
From
​
twint
​
,
we
are
only
able
to
scrape
original
tweets;
we
unfortunately
cannot
access
retweets
or
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
replies
to
tweets

 Summary Statistics of Twitter Album Data
 
 
At
the
time
of
their
first
album
release,
BTS
already
had
a
fanbase
of
255k
strong,
though
it
is
an
entire
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
two
orders
of
magnitude
smaller
than
the
more
established
Taylor
Swift
and
Justin
Bieber
fanbases.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Though
BTS’s
followers
have
grown
to
the
scale
of
the
other
two
artists
as
of
their
most
recent
album
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
release,
they
still
have
far
less
followers,
from
⅓
to
less
than
¼
the
size
of
the
other
two
artists.
Despite
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this
disadvantage,
the
number
of
tweets,
retweets,
and
unique
users
actively
engaging
during
BTS
album
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
release periods completely dominates the numbers for both Swift and Bieber.
 
 
 
By
sheer
numbers,
BTS
Twitter
fans
appear
to
carry
more
weight
per
individual
which
more
than
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compensates
for
their
lower
overall
size
throughout
the
three
albums.
These
values
give
us
a
good
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
indication
of
the
size
and
power
of
these
fanbases.
By
the
third
album,
there
are
about
1.1
total
tweets
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(including
replies)
per
follower
for
BTS
in
that
time
period,
while
Taylor
Swift
and
Justin
Bieber
average
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
0.020
and
0.0035
tweets
per
follower.
Though
BTS
has
a
relatively
smaller
fanbase
size
as
defined
by
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
number of followers, its members are far and beyond more actively engaging on Twitter.
 
 
 
However,
sheer
numbers
alone
do
not
conclusively
indicate
collaboration.
It
is
possible
that
the
original
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tweets
in
our
dataset
could
largely
be
independent
individuals
tweeting
about
their
favorite
artists/albums.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As
a
specialty
of
fandom
Twitter—not
counting
artist
and
public
relations
(PR)
tweet
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
contributions—there
are
two
main
subsets
of
users:
content
generators
and
amplifiers.
We
define
content
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
generators
as
users
that
account
for
the
majority
of
non-artist/non-PR
engagement
(since
naturally,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
artist/PR
users
account
for
the
majority),
users
such
as
dedicated
fan-pages
or
prominent
figures,
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
define
amplifiers
as
users
that
primarily
engaging
with
content
on
Twitter
(liking,
retweeting,
replying).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Content
generators
are
interesting
to
study
because
many
(if
not
all)
Twitter
movements
are
started
by
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
small
group
of
content
generators
that
encourage
their
fellow
fans
to
promote
some
cause,
whether
that
be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mobilizing a hashtag takeover or spreading the publicity of an album at the time of an album release.
 
 
 
Naturally,
content
generators
make
up
a
very
small
portion
of
total
Twitter
users
(
​
Figure
9
​
),
but
account
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for
the
majority
of
engagement.
With
the
amount
of
engagement
the
content
they
push
out
receives,
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
consider
them
a
primary
driving
force
behind
Twitter
collaboration,
since
they
enable
mutual
engagement
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from
their
posts.
For
example,
if
a
content
generator
posts
a
tweet
asking
for
fans
to
report
to
spread
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
release
of
an
album
for
more
people
to
listen
to
it,
fans
collaborate
by
liking
(increasing
visibility),
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
retweeting
(sharing),
and
replying
(adding
their
own
content).
So,
by
studying
these
content
generators,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
we
are
better
able
to
study
the
mechanisms
behind
collaboration
on
Twitter,
opposed
to
just
looking
at
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
raw numbers and assuming collaboration.

To
fairly
compare
the
role
and
power
of
content
generators
across
the
three
artists
and
their
albums,
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
normalized
each
of
the
albums
to
compare
how
the
fanbases
changed
over
the
years.
Since
there
is
no
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
simple
way
of
classifying
content
generator
users,
we
chose
to
analyze
a
curve
borrowing
the
concept
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
​
Lorenz
Curve
to
calculate
and
visualize
the
​
A
​
percentage
of
these
few
users
(content
generators)
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
account for 
​

Before
studying
these
albums
separately,
we
needed
to
understand
the
baseline
statistics
for
the
metrics
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
we
were
studying.
We
created
a
sample
dataset
composed
of
100k
tweets
evenly
sampled
from
these
nine
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
datasets
as
an
approximation
of
what
Fandom
Twitter
looks
like
around
the
time
of
an
album
release,
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
computed
our
metrics
on
it.
By
evenly
sampling
from
each
of
our
nine
datasets,
we
are
effectively
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“bootstrapping”
our
data,
with
each
sample
from
each
dataset
representing
a
possible
album
release
at
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
certain point in time of a hypothetical artist’s fandom maturity.
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 10: 
​
Basic Statistics of Baseline Sample
 
 
To
apply
the
Lorenz
Curve
concept,
we
looked
at
original
tweets,
since
content
generator
tweets
are
all
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
original
tweets
by
definition.
Visualizing
and
analyzing
curves
through
that
range
allows
us
to
effectively
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
envision what content generator impact looks like.

Figure 11:  
​
Plots for 0-5% of Users Accounting for B% Engagement for the Baseline Sample
 
 
 
These
baseline
values
give
us
an
idea
of
what
collaboration
might
generally
look
like
for
fandom
Twitter.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In
​
Figure
11
​
,
we
see
that
the
majority
of
engagement
accounted
for
is
by
a
very
small
percentage
of
users
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with
only
0.5%
of
users
accounting
for
90.65%
of
all
retweets
in
our
dataset.
We
will
compare
these
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
metrics
across
the
artists
and
albums
to
see
if
there
truly
is
a
significantly
higher
level
of
collaboration
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enabled
from
BTS
content
generators.
Furthermore,
we
will
also
explore
how
and
if
other
non-query
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hashtags
co-appeared.
This
is
a
possible
indication
of
internal
content
generator
collaboration
to
circulate
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
other
hashtags,
since
hashtags
spread
tweet
publicity,
and
they
are
often
used
to
connect
otherwise
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
separate conversations on Twitter.
 
 
3.3
Wikipedia
 
 
 
To
obtain
our
Wikipedia
revision
history,
we
used
the
MediaWiki
API
to
scrape
the
complete
revision
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
history
in
XML
format
of
relevant
articles,
including
their
Talk
pages.
We
scraped
the
main
pages
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
each
artist
and
the
pages
for
the
albums
of
interest.
In
addition,
we
used
the
MediaWiki
API
to
collect
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Wikipedia pageviews, which contain information about how many people viewed a certain page.
 
 
After
downloading
the
full
revision
history,
we
converted
the
data
into
a
much
smaller
“light
dump”
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
format,
similar
to
the
methods
of
Sumi
et
al
[10].
An
article’s
light
dump
contains
the
article
title,
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
timestamp
of
each
revision,
the
index
of
each
revision,
whether
or
not
each
revision
was
a
revert
of
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
previous revision, the length of each revision, and the registered username or the IP address of the editor.

One
of
the
easiest
ways
to
measure
collaboration
is
by
the
amount
of
revisions
per
article;
from
this,
it’s
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
evident
that
collaboration
among
editors
for
the
Taylor
Swift
and
Justin
Bieber
pages
outscale
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
collaboration
among
BTS’s
editors.
There
are
also
more
editors
on
average
on
Taylor
Swift
pages
than
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
others,
which
speaks
to
the
scale
of
collaboration
on
Wikipedia.
Reverts
are
another
way
to
easily
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
distinguish
collaboration--
more
reverts
lead
to
more
conflict,
which
indicates
less
effective
collaboration.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Justin
Bieber’s
pages
lead
in
the
number
of
reverts
per
month.
Among
all
the
editors,
there
are
a
small
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
number
of
bots
that
edit
these
pages.
However,
since
we
are
primarily
interested
in
human
fan-based
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
collaboration,
we’ve
eliminated
bot
activity
in
the
rest
of
our
analysis.
Additionally,
the
article’s
Talk
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pages,
where
users
are
able
to
discuss
open
issues
and
changes
on
the
main
Wikipedia
page,
has
less
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
activity
overall
when
compared
to
revisions
on
the
main
page,
suggesting
that
editors
usually
make
edits
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
directly instead of discussing it through the Talk page.
 
 
It’s
important
to
note
that
the
time
that
these
Wikipedia
articles
have
been
active
may
play
a
factor
in
how
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
much
traction
they
received.
Overall,
the
amount
of
edits
on
Wikipedia
has
been
decreasing,
with
a
6.90%
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
decrease
from
2019-2020
alone
[11].
Taylor
Swift’s
article
was
created
on
June
4th,
2006;
Justin
Bieber’s
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on
April
22nd,
2008;
and
BTS’s
following
their
debut
on
July
4th,
2013.
To
account
for
these
differences,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
we
normalized
by
the
number
of
months
since
the
article
was
released
in
​
Figure
12
to
accurately
compare
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the three articles.
 
 
 
For
context,
during
the
month
of
February
2021,
the
entirety
of
English
Wikipedia
received
a
total
of
22
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
billion
page
views
and
46
million
edits
on
its
52
million
pages.
Though
there
exists
a
multitude
of
pages
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that are never viewed and edited, the pages that we are studying are consistently active [11].
 
 
Figure 13:
​
 Wikipedia Pageviews per Month since 2015
 
 On
average,
the
number
of
users
who
viewed
the
Taylor
Swift
and
Justin
Bieber
Wikipedia
pages
each
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
month
stay
between
400k
to
800k,
with
obvious
occasional
spikes.
However,
interest
in
BTS’s
Wikipedia
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
page
remained
low
until
March
of
2020
when
the
number
of
views
became
comparable
to
that
of
Taylor
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Swift
and
Justin
Bieber’s
Wikipedia
pages.
Overall,
it
appears
that
the
trend
in
Wikipedia
page
views
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
stays
relatively
constant
with
regular
spikes.
Notably,
these
large
spikes
can
be
correlated
with
recent
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
album releases or other major career developments.
 
 
For Taylor Swift, the obvious spikes in the pageviews correspond to the following events:
 
-
August 2017: Release of studio album ‘Reputation’
 
-
August 2019: Release of studio album ‘Lover’
 
-
December 2020: Release of studio album ‘Evermore’
 
 
For
Justin
Bieber,
the
two
biggest
spikes
correspond
to
the
release
of
‘Despacito’
in
April
2017
and
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
release
of
“No
Brainer”
in
July
of
2018.
For
BTS,
the
growth
in
pageviews
began
in
2020,
when
their
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
singles “Dynamite”  and “Life Goes On” reached number one on US Billboard Hot 100.

an
insight
into
how
many
people
browsed
the

they
don’t
give
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
us
a

of
collaboration.
Revisions
on

idea
about
overall
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
collaboration on the platform.
 
 
 
As
shown
in
​
Figure

​
,
the
number
of
revisions
made
on
a
Wikipedia

per

has
much
less
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
activity
compared
to
an
article’s
page
views.
However,
spikes
are
common
in
both
page
views
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
number
of

Taylor

has
larger

compared
to

quickly
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
catches
up
in
revisions
over
time
after
their
article
was
created
in
2013.
Based
on
revisions
alone,
it
seems
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that
editors
who
revise
Taylor
Swift’s
Wikipedia
page
participate
in
a
larger
scale
of
collaboration
than
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
other
editors.
On
a
whole,
the
number
of
revisions
per
month
stays
usually
within
0
to
150
revisions,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
but there is a rare spike in the data where the number of revisions reaches over 600.
 
  
Figure 14:
​
 Wikipedia Page Revisions per Month since Article Creation
 
 
Since
the
data
is
binned
by
month,
it’s
difficult
to
correlate
specific
events
to
the
spikes.
We
theorize
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Taylor Swift’s first spikes in page revisions are correlated with the following events:
 
-
Late 2007: Her singles “Our Song” and “Should’ve Said No” reached number one on iTunes
 
-
Early 2012: Swift receives 2 Grammy awards at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards
 
 
With
much
rarer
spikes
in
the
data,
it’s
difficult
to
attribute
major
album
release
dates
with
more
revisions
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on
Wikipedia.
Instead,
we
speculate
that
collaboration
in
the
form
of
revisions
most
likely
happens
after
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
an event that hasn’t been pre-announced occurs (for example, winning a Grammy’s award).
 
 
Revision
length
also
gives
us
a
deeper
understanding
into
the
rate
of
collaboration
within
each
revision.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall,
the
data
from
​
Figure
15
(below)
​
forms
lines
with
many
sudden
dips
and
incremental
increases
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
revision
length.
Taylor
Swift’s
Wikipedia
page
is
overall
longer
than
the
other
artists,
and
there
is
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
noticeable
period
of
dramatic
increase
in
revision
length
during
2012.
There’s
also
a
sharp
decrease
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
length,
which
may
signify
a
period
of
dispute
between
editors
during
2016.
The
decrease
in
Taylor
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Swift’s
page’s
revision
length
history
is
rare
because
other
dips
in
the
chart
recover
almost
instantly,
but
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this
particular
decrease
in
content
remained
that
way
until
editors
slowly
continued
revising
the
article.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Justin
Bieber’s
revision
length
history
has
noticeably
more
sudden
dips,
which
might
hint
that
editors
are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
having
more
disagreements
and
thus
need
to
delete
each
other’s
work.
BTS’s
revision
length
history
has
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
fastest
growth
of
the
three
artists’
pages,
suggesting
that
editors
on
BTS’s
Wikipedia
page
collaborate
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on
a
faster
timeline,
contributing
to
more
page
content
in
a
shorter
amount
of
time
than
that
of
Taylor
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Swift’s or Justin Bieber’s.

Editors
on
Wikipedia
typically
don’t
edit
many
pages,
as
​
Figure

suggests.
Most
editors
in
an

in

and
Justin
Bieber’s
editor
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
contributions.
However,
when
plotted
on
the

scale,
there
are
much
more
editors
on
Taylor
Swift’s

Results
 
 
To
explore
the
differences
between
fan
participation
for
our
three
artists,
we
specifically
analyzed
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
visualized
the
time
frames
surrounding
three
chosen
album
releases
for
each
artist.
First,
we
utilized
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Google
Trends
to
estimate
a
baseline
popularity
level
for
all
three
artists;
unlike
Twitter
or
Wikipedia,
this
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
measures
no
collaboration,
only
search
interest.
We
then
used
various
Twitter
metrics
to
quantify
lower
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mid-effort
collaboration
and
Wikipedia
to
examine
high-effort
fan
participation,
as
Wikipedia
has
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
highest effort required for collaboration.
 
 From
our
previous
data
analysis,
we
found
that
there
were
consistent
engagement
and
popularity
spikes
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
during
the
period
surrounding
album
releases
such
as
increased
search
interest
on
Google
Trends,
original
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
posts
on
Twitter,
and
revisions
and
pageviews
on
Wikipedia.
As
such,
we
focused
our
efforts
on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
examining fan participation in these previously set album release periods.
 
 
4.1
Google Trends
 
 
For
our
album-specific
trend
analysis,
we
examined
both
Arts
and
Entertainment
related
and
general
trend
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
data
to
eliminate
any
possible
misclassifications
and
attempt
to
understand
the
relative
interest
in
our
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
three
musical
artists
in
relation
to
the
entertainment
industry
as
well
as
general
topics.
Interest
is
defined
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
daily
rather
than
monthly
as
in
our
previous
historical
search.
Note
that
each
time
period
is
indexed
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
differently
based
on
the
volume
of
searches
during
that
specific
period,
meaning
that
trends
that
appear
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
our
biweekly
data
may
not
be
evident
in
monthly
or
yearly
data.
Again,
we
also
see
different
trends
based
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on
how
the
category
is
set
(specific
or
all).
Additionally,
since
the
artists
do
not
share
common
release
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dates,
their
represented
interest
popularity
is
relative
to
the
search
trends
during
those
individual
album
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
release periods.
 
 
 
Figure 17:
​
 Google Trends Arts and Entertainment  (left) and General (right) Search Data for each Artist
 
for First (top), Second (middle), and Third (bottom) Albums
 
 
For
all
artists
across
each
album,
outside
of
BTS
for
their
first
album,
we
see
a
spike
in
search
interest
on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
album
release
though
the
size
of
the
spike
varies.
During
the
release
of
their
first
album,
interest
in
BTS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
was
close
to
zero,
even
on
release
day.
This
may
be
due
to
the
recency
of
BTS’s
debut
and
their
lack
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
presence
outside
of
Asia
as
a
result.
For
album
one,
Swift
and
Bieber
have
similar
general
popularity
at
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
72.87 and 83.27 on average, with Swift seeing a larger spike despite having lower average interest.
 
 
 
Surprisingly,
Bieber
has
higher
general
and
Arts
and
Entertainment
related
interest
for
album
one
despite
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this
album
being
his
second,
not
including
his
Christmas
album,
while
album
one
is
Swift’s
fifth
album.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In
contrast
to
Swift
and
Bieber,
BTS
only
averages
11.07
for
our
general
search,
with
their
peak
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
popularity
during
this
period
at
a
mere
8,
which
is
significantly
lower
than
Swift
and
Bieber’s
general
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
minimums
of
53
and
71
respectively.
At
this
point
in
time,
Western
artists
are
much
more
likely
to
be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
searched than K-pop group, BTS.
 
 
 
Figure 18:
​
 Summary Statistics of General Search for the First Albums
 
 
With
the
second
albums,
we
begin
to
see
the
rise
of
BTS’s
popularity
four
years
following
their
first
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
release,
with
over
a
50
point
jump
to
a
65.6
average
general
interest.
In
contrast,
Bieber
maintained
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
similar
average
interest
of
81.53,
a
small
two-point
decrease,
while
Swift
fell
roughly
30
points
to
an
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
average
of
41.73.
During
the
second
album
period,
Bieber
continued
to
lead
in
both
Arts
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Entertainment
and
general
search
interest
while
Swift
sees
the
largest
spike
on
album
release
day
as
well
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as
the
sharpest
fall
in
interest
following
the
increase.
In
comparison,
BTS
and
Bieber
see
more
sustained
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“hype”
as
interest
remains
higher
at
or
above
interest
prior
to
the
album
with
a
more
steady
decline
from
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the peak.
 
 
 
Figure 19:
​

[Appendix]
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
but
rises
above
Swift
by
day
three
of
the
Arts
and
Entertainment
related
search
and
both
Swift
and
Bieber
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on
day
three
of
the
general
search,
before
stabilizing
at
a
level
above
Taylor
Swift
a
few
days
after
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
release.
Interestingly,
Bieber
again
experiences
a
notable
spike
in
interest
about
10
days
following
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
release
of
​
Purpose
​
.
This
may
be
due
to
his
performance
at
the
2015
American
Music
Awards
on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
November 22, 2015.
 
 
By
the
third
albums,
BTS
has
become
the
most
searched
of
the
three
artists
with
an
average
general
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
interest
of
64.33
against
Swift’s
28.6
and
Bieber’s
28.33.
Though
BTS
has
increased
this
average
by
over
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
50
points
since
their
debut,
they
have
yet
to
reach
the
same
popularity
of
Swift
and
Bieber
during
their
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
prime.
In
addition,
the
average
general
search
popularity
for
BTS
decreased
by
about
one
point
between
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
albums
two
and
three.
Bieber
has
a
similar
level
of
interest
during
this
time
period
for
the
Arts
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Entertainment
search
but
his
general
interest
is
significantly
lower
than
BTS,
and
less
than
Swift
prior
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
release
day
and
four
days
after.
Both
BTS
and
Swift
jump
to
the
maximum
possible
interest
level
on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
release
day
while
Bieber
falls
short
at
approximately
85
in
the
Arts
and
Entertainment
search
and
45
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
general
search.
Throughout
all
three
releases,
Swift
experiences
a
quick
peak
for
the
actual
album
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
release,
though
this
is
more
evident
in
albums
two
and
three,
​
Reputation
and
​
Folklore
​
,
before
steeply
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dropping, often returning to roughly pre-album levels by the end of the 12 days following.
 
 
 
 
Figure 20:
​
 Summary Statistics of General Search for the Third Albums
 
 
These
plots
show
the
growth
of
the
BTS
fanbase
and
significance
as
they
become
more
searched
than
two
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
more
established
Western
artists,
as
we
expected.
As
we
progress
through
the
albums,
it
is
evident
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
interest
in
BTS
is
rising
while
interest
in
Swift
and
Bieber
has
generally
decreased
in
comparison
to
their
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
earlier
releases.
This
is
consistent
with
the
overall
interest
over
time
for
all
three
artists
as
discussed
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
above.
 
 
 
4.2
Twitter
 
 
 
As
previously
mentioned,
our
Twitter
analysis
primarily
focused
on
identifying
dedicated
content
creators
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
responsible
for
the
promotion
and
encouragement
of
Twitter
engagement
and
subsequent
collaboration
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
during
album
releases.
Prior
to
analyzing
engagement
content,
we
plotted
the
number
of
original
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(non-retweet) tweets per day during the album release periods to visualize the general creation trends.
 
 
  
Figure 21: 
​
Original Tweets per Day for Each Album
 
 
From
these
plots,
we
see
an
expected
trend:
the
number
of
tweets
per
day
increases
until
peaks
around
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
time
of
the
album
release
before
declining
throughout
the
week
following.
These
time-series
give
us
an
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
additional
look
at
the
sheer
volume
of
tweets
BTS
fans
are
pumping
out
compared
to
Taylor
Swift
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Justin Bieber fans.
 
 
4.2.1
Content Generator Engagement
 
 
In
our
content
generator
engagement
analysis,
we
are
looking
to
see
which
fanbase
has
the
greatest
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
percentage
of
content
generators
relative
to
the
total
engagement.
If
this
percentage
is
larger
for
a
specific
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fanbase,
we
can
say
that
that
fanbase’s
content
generators
are
responsible
for
more
of
the
collaboration
on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Twitter.
From
applying
the
content
generator
analysis
across
the
three
album
releases
for
each
artist,
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
are
able
to
estimate
and
plot
the
percentage
of
the
total
amount
of
likes,
retweets,
and
replies
that
were
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
accounted for by them for each of the three albums.
 
 
Figure 22: 
​
Plots for 0-5% of Users Accounting for B% Engagement for the First Albums
 
 
The
plots
in
​
Figure
22
​
show
the
percentages
of
likes,
retweets,
and
replies
that
content
generators
were
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
accounted
for
for
each
of
their
first
albums
we
analyzed.
During
this
time
period,
BTS
had
roughly
255k
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 followers
compared
to
the
tens
of
millions
that
Taylor
Swift
and
Justin
Bieber
had.
Despite
this,
there
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were
still
a
similar
amount
of
unique
tweets
during
the
time
period
as
seen
in
​
Figure
21
​
.
Presumably
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
since
the
K-pop
online
fandom
outside
of
BTS
had
already
been
long
established,
and
content
generators
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were
already
influential
and
pushing
content
since
the
beginning,
BTS
largely
comes
out
on
top
of
all
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
three
artists
in
these
curves,
meaning
that
their
content
generators
were
responsible
for
more
of
their
total
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
engagement, and thus promoted more collaboration.
 
 
 
 
Figure 23: 
​
Plots for 0-5% of Users Accounting for B% Engagement for the Second Albums
 
 
For
the
second
albums,
we
see
that
BTS
has
begun
to
pull
away,
notably
leading
in
both
likes
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
retweets.
It’s
particularly
interesting
that
at
this
point
in
time,
and
later
during
the
third
album,
BTS
has
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
far
higher
Twitter
engagement
specifically
for
original
tweets.
From
​
Figure
23
​
,
we
see
that
there
are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
significantly
more
BTS-related
tweets
per
day,
up
to
double
to
triple
the
amount
for
Swift
or
Bieber.
With
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this
observation,
we
expect
the
denominator
for
our
content
generator
percentage
calculation
to
be
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
much
larger
since
there
are
many
more
original
tweets
to
be
engaged
with,
even
if
the
average
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
engagement
per
tweet
is
low.
However,
BTS
content
generators
still
consistently
account
for
a
higher
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
majority of engagement than the other two artists.
 
  
Figure 24: 
​
Plots for 0-5% of Users Accounting for B% Engagement for the First Albums
 
 
By
the
time
we
reach
the
third
album,
we
again
see
that
the
sheer
number
of
original
tweets
per
day
about
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
BTS
has
reached
an
entire
order
of
magnitude
higher
than
totals
for
either
Taylor
Swift
or
Justin
Bieber
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Figure
21)
​
.
As
aforementioned,
this
means
the
denominator
for
our
percentage
calculation
is
that
much
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
greater.
Despite
this,
BTS
content
generators
still
outperform
the
other
artists’
content
generators
across
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
board
for
our
percentage
ranges.
Through
our
analyses
for
these
three
periods
of
time,
we
see
that
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
numbers
support
our
hypothesis:
BTS
content
generators
make
up
more
of
the
total
engagement
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
better enable collaboration between members of the fanbase on Twitter.
 
 
4.2.2
Hashtags
 
 
As
aforementioned,
hashtags
are
interesting
to
study
because
they
connect
otherwise
potentially
separate
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conversations
on
Twitter.
In
a
study
performed
by
Agorapulse,
researchers
found
that
tweets
with
4-5
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hashtags
averaged
about
27%
more
impressions
(or
tweet
views)
than
tweets
with
2-3
hashtags
[8].
In
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
other words, it generally appears that the more hashtags a tweet contains, the more reach that tweet has.
 
 
 
 
 Figure 25: 
​
Average Number of Hashtags per Tweet over the Three Albums
 
 
In
​
Figure
25
​
,
we
see
that
across
all
three
albums,
BTS
tweets
have
more
hashtags
per
tweet
on
average.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It’s
possible
that
this
simple
statistic
is
another
mechanism
behind
the
incredible
volume
of
collaboration
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
we
see
from
BTS
fans
online.
To
further
explore
this,
we
analyzed
how
often
other
non-query
hashtags
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
co-appeared
within
our
dataset
by
calculating
the
percentage
of
tweets
each
hashtag
appears
in.
We
chose
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to analyze hashtags as a case study, and only selected the third albums for each of the artists to compare.
 
 
 
 
Figure 26: 
​
Top 20 Hashtags that Appear in Third Album Tweets
 
 
 
As
expected,
the
top
two
hashtags
for
each
of
the
three
artists
are
the
query
hashtags:
the
primary
artist
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hashtag
and
the
primary
album
hashtag.
Beyond
that,
we
see
that
across
all
three
albums,
there
are
many
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
additional
album
related
hashtags
such
as
song
names
from
those
albums
(
​
#lifegoeson
​
,
​
#cardigan
​
,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
#yummy
​
).
These
hashtags
don’t
tell
us
much
about
collaboration,
since
tweets
containing
these
hashtags
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
could very well just be fans sharing their favorite songs from the album.
 
 
 
Another
category
of
hashtags
that
we
primarily
see
with
BTS
is
music
award
promotion
hashtags
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(
​
#mamavote
​
,
​
#2020mama
​
,
#
​
bousnidstars2020
​
),
which
are
hashtags
fans
use
to
encourage
their
fellow
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fans
to
vote
for
their
favorite
artist.
Though
the
usage
of
these
hashtags
would
be
interesting
to
study
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
collaboration,
it
may
be
that
these
hashtags
are
prominent
in
BTS-related
tweets
due
to
outside
timing;
it’s
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
possible that there were no major award events taking place close to Swift and Bieber’s album releases.
 
 
To
continue
our
case
study
and
to
fairly
compare
hashtag
collaboration,
we
looked
at
the
most
commonly
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
appearing
hashtag
for
each
of
the
albums
that
didn’t
fall
into
that
do
not
fall
into
either
of
these
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
categories,
​
#army
​
(referencing
the
BTS
fanbase
“BTS
Army,”
not
the
military
“army”),
​
#proudoftaylor
​
,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 #bieber2020
​
.
Since
they
are
not
connected
to
other
forces
(either
albums
or
award
shows),
the
spread
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
these hashtags throughout Twitter is likely from the work of content generators.
 
 
 
 
Figure 27: 
​
Statistics on Three Chosen Hashtags
 
 
As
expected
from
the
volume
of
BTS
​
Be
​
original
tweets,
there
are
far
more
tweets
that
contain
​
#army
​
.
As
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a
result,
high
outliers
do
not
impact
the
average
as
much
as
they
would
for
the
​
#proudoftaylor
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
#bieber2020
​
.
Additionally,
tweets
that
contain
​
#army
have
a
higher
number
of
hashtags
per
tweet
on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
average than the other two hashtags.
 
 
 
Figure 28:
​
 Average Engagement Numbers per Tweet for Tweets with Chosen Hashtags
 
 
For
the
average
engagement
of
tweets
containing
these
hashtags,
we
also
see
that
BTS
fan
engagement
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
likes
and
retweets
outstandingly
outnumbers
that
of
Taylor
Swift
and
Justin
Bieber.
Overall,
we
see
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
BTS
content
generators
are
consistently
more
effective
than
Taylor
Swift
and
Justin
Bieber
content
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
generators at facilitating Twitter collaboration.

Using
our
Wikipedia
data,
we
looked
into
the
number
of
page
views,
number
of
revisions,
and
revision
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
length during days that were close to album release dates.
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 29:
​
 Album Comparisons for Wikipedia Pageviews during Album Release
 
 
We
began
our
comparisons
with
albums
that
released
after
2015,
which
is
when
the
MediaWiki
API
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
began
to
collect
page
view
data.
We
see
that
for
our
album
two
comparisons,
the
Taylor
Swift
and
Justin
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bieber
album
pages
lead
in
views
each
day.
However,
there’s
a
general
trend
where
the
number
of
views
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
increases
prior
to
album
release,
peaks
at
album
release,
and
decreases
in
the
days
after.
Similarly,
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
same
trend
can
be
seen
in
our
album
three
comparisons.
However,
Taylor
Swift’s
page
views
on
her
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
album
pages
have
quadrupled
that
of
BTS’s,
suggesting
that
interest
in
her
album,
at
least
on
Wikipedia,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
significantly outweighs the interest in BTS’s album and Justin Bieber’s album.
 
 
 
 
Figure 30:
​
 Album Comparisons for Wikipedia Revisions during Album Release
 
 
Figure
30
(above)
compares
the
number
of
revisions
for
albums
released
during
a
similar
time
period
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
three
artists:
BTS,
Taylor
Swift,
and
Justin
Bieber.
We
see
that
the
first
albums
(left)
all
have
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 relatively
low
revision
numbers
due
to
the
artists’
low
career
age.
During
this
period,
revisions
each
day
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ranged
from
0
to
25,
and
there
is
no
noticeable
difference
between
the
days
prior
and
after
album
release.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For
the
second
album,
after
some
time,
the
artists
have
all
gained
some
popularity
and
released
a
few
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
studio
albums.
Here,
we
see
a
greater
number
of
revisions
as
compared
to
album
one,
with
more
revisions
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on
the
individual
album
pages.
By
the
third
album
periods
in
2020,
all
three
artists
gained
a
notable
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
amount
of
popularity
and
became
relevant
in
mainstream
US
media.
Although
we
expected
more
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
collaboration
on
the
BTS
wikipedia
page
from
our
Twitter
analysis,
the
results
actually
show
the
opposite.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Taylor
Swift’s
album
page
leads
in
the
number
of
revisions,
especially
on
the
day
of
the
album
release.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Revisions
on
Justin
Bieber’s
album
page
show
a
similar
pattern,
peaking
on
the
day
of
his
album
release
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
slowly
decreases
as
time
goes
on.
This
trend
doesn’t
appear
with
BTS’s
album
page
as
the
number
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
revisions stays low throughout the 12 day interval.
 
 
 
Figure 31:
​
 Album Comparisons for Wikipedia Revision Length during Album Release
 
 
In
addition,
we
also
explored
how
the
revision
length
changed
over
time
for
these
album
pages.
For
album
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
one,
the
length
of
the
revisions
for
all
artists
stayed
mostly
the
same,
excluding
the
album
page
for
BTS’s
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dark
&
Wild,
which
had
no
revisions
during
that
time
period.
For
album
two,
the
revision
length
seems
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be
slowly
increasing
for
all
three
album
pages.
The
same
upward
slope
is
seen
in
both
BTS
and
Justin
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bieber’s
album
pages
for
album
three
(right),
suggesting
a
slow
but
steady
effort
in
collaboration
among
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Wikipedia
editors.
However,
the
article
for
Taylor
Swift’s
Folklore
has
a
much
steeper
upward
slope
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
revision
length,
suggesting
that
editors
in
Taylor
Swift’s
Folklore
page
were
contributing
more
content
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with each revision.
 
 
 
4.4
Summary
 
 
By
exploring
how
fanbases
participate
in
fandom
online
through
Twitter
and
Wikipedia
engagement,
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
found
that
BTS
has
far
greater
collaboration
online
compared
to
others
despite
their
smaller
social
media
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
following.
On
average,
individuals
part
of
BTS
Army
engage
more
per
fan
compared
to
Swifties
or
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Beilebers,
resulting
in
a
great
online
presence.
This
is
further
amplified
as
BTS
has
broken
into
Western
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mainstream
media;
their
fans
have
made
a
name
for
themselves
as
one
of
the
most
devoted
fan
groups
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
across
any
industry.
Compared
to
the
explored
Western
fanbases,
K-pop
fans
are
more
actively
engaged
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 in
fandom
rather
than
casually
following
an
artist’s
career
and
ending
there.
This
is
the
power
of
BTS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Army
and
the
K-pop
fandom;
though
their
numbers
might
be
smaller
than
those
of
other
artists,
they
are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
extremely
dedicated
and
exceptionally
vocal
about
it.
It’s
no
doubt
that
in
spite
of
their
seemingly
smaller
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
size,
the
K-pop
fanbase
is
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with.
Their
overall
online
presence
and
collaboration
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
speaks
volumes
over
the
rest,
compensating
for
their
numbers
with
unwavering
commitment
to
their
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
idols.
 
 
5
Limitations and Constraints, Future Directions
 
 
The
conflict
and
collaboration
of
online
fanbases
is
a
currently
evolving
topic,
and
as
such
is
not
fully
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
explored
or
understood
yet.
However,
due
to
this,
it
is
difficult
to
create
a
perfect
measure
of
fan
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
engagement
and
their
influence
on
different
events.
While
we
examined
multiple
platforms
and
looked
at

Conclusion
 
 
Through
our
exploration
of
fan
behavior
online,
we
found
that
BTS,
and
perhaps
K-pop
as
a
whole,
boast
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
most
actively
engaged
fanbase
through
our
analysis
of
Twitter
and
Wikipedia
participation.
From
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Google
Trends,
we
were
able
to
estimate
the
general
popularity
of
our
three
artists,
BTS,
Taylor
Swift,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
Justin
Bieber,
across
three
different
albums
and
visualize
their
growth
since
2004.
BTS
has
risen
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
global
prominence
since
their
debut
in
2011,
quickly
gaining
popularity
over
two
well-established
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Western artists by 2018.
 
 
 
As
we
initially
predicted,
K-pop
fan
interaction
and
collaboration
on
Twitter
overshadows
that
of
Swifties
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or
Beliebers
in
spite
of
their
smaller
overall
size.
On
Twitter,
a
platform
known
for
its
quick,
short
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
interaction
style,
BTS
fans
reign
supreme,
boasting
greater
interaction
per
individual
compared
to
our
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
other
two
artists,
especially
in
regards
to
likes
and
retweets.
However,
the
impact
of
BTS
Army
falls
short
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on
Wikipedia,
a
platform
that
requires
a
higher
level
of
effort
and
domain
knowledge
for
participation
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 collaboration.
Though
page
views
for
BTS
pages
have
increased
since
2015,
BTS
pages
generally
have
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
less
revisions
with
shorter
revision
lengths
compared
to
Taylor
Swift
and
Justin
Bieber
articles,
especially
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
former.
Despite
this,
BTS
fan
participation
on
Wikipedia
is
not
non-existent;
as
of
their
most
recent
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
album, 
​
Be
​
, revision lengths of BTS-related pages is significantly greater than that of Swift or Bieber.
 
 
 
Overall,
though
the
BTS
fanbase
may
not
have
the
unparalleled
impact
we
initially
predicted,
their
scale
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
power
are
greater
than
their
numbers
may
suggest,
especially
on
Twitter.
As
evident
through
our
data
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
analysis,
there’s
no
doubt
that
we’re
seeing
an
increased
interest
in
K-pop
as
more
groups
break
into
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
global markets and social media helps promote fans’ favorite idols; this is only the start.

 ","The paper by Darren Liu, Casey Duong, and Kylee Peng from the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute at the University of California, San Diego, investigates the scale and influence of online fan communities (fandoms) on media and industries. The study focuses on fan groups' collaborative efforts on social media platforms like Twitter and Wikipedia, using BTS (a K-pop group), Taylor Swift, and Justin Bieber as case studies.

Key findings include:
- Fan communities are highly active online and can rally behind causes or promote their favorite artists.
- K-pop fandoms, particularly BTS's ""ARMY,"" are notable for their large-scale collaborative presence online.
- The research presents a new method to quantify the strength and influence of online fan communities.
- Analysis of Twitter data revealed that K-pop fans effectively use social media to organize around social justice causes (e.g., Black Lives Matter protests).
- The study also explores how fans collaborate differently across platforms like Twitter and Wikipedia.

The authors conclude that despite having a smaller following compared to Western artists like Swift and Bieber, BTS's fanbase is more actively engaged online. This demonstrates the power of dedicated fandoms in shaping media presence and influencing industry trends. The paper suggests further research into fan community behaviors across different platforms and industries for a more comprehensive understanding."

Wikipedia’s Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic
Abstract
Through collaborative efforts online,
Wikipedia has always been at the forefront of
providing information to the public on almost
any topic, including a pandemic. Covid-19 has
been one of the most relevant topics of 2020 and
still remains so as of right now, therefore
gathering as much information as possible is
essential for the world to combat such a virus.
Many official health sources online provide such
knowledge with the resources that they have, but
false or outdated information can spread quickly.
In this article, we perform EDA and LDA on
different Wikipedia articles related to
coronavirus and compare the results to the word
clouds of traditional sources to explore how
Wikipedia can provide reliable and updated
details and data about Covid-19.
Introduction
Given the current pandemic, up to date
information is essential to keeping people safe
and informed. Traditional online sources such as
the CDC, World Health Organization and John
Hopkins, provide up to date and reliable
information on COVID numbers and
information. However online platforms such as
Wikipedia, also provide a comprehensive and
real time approach to analyzing a pandemic.
There can be complications with online
platforms providing false information and
reporting conspiracy theories, however we
believe these discrepancies are fixed by credible
editors preserving Wikipedia’s facts. By June
2020, covid articles on Wikipedia had over 400
million pageviews.
1
We are going to investigate
how these articles are
created and edited, and how an online
community can be used to monitor a pandemic.
Online communities present real time, unique,
1
h t t p s : / / w i k i m e d i a f o u n d a t i o n . o r g / c o v i d 1 9 / d a t acomprehensive information and a new
understanding of the covid pandemic by
studying page views, edits and comparing
information to reliable sources.
We are going to justify that an online
community can be used to provide reliable
information on the safety and health of
everyone. The problem is that inaccurate
information being spread about a global
pandemic can be costly and detrimental. We plan
on using several methods to quantify the
reliability of wikipedia information.
The data is bound to the past year, since
the covid pandemic first began back in
November of 2019. Our scope is limited to
articles about covid from 2019 to present. The
bar graph to the left shows the counts of edits
made by year on the article titled “COVID-19
Pandemic”, it appears all of the edits occurred in
2020.  We will also use other aggregated data
sources found in the COVID-19 Data
Repository

and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins

University to make comparisons between
Wikipedia data and traditional data sources.
Since the pandemic is global we are
going to analyze the resources presented in other
countries, and compare those results/information
to more reliable sources. The map to the left is
provided by Wikipedia, with the confirmed cases
displayed throughout the entire continent. This
type of information is available for most
locations in the world.
We are going to look at the editors who
are editing covid information the most and see
the disparities across different regions on this
information. The pie chart to the right shows the
top 10 editors for the article titled “COVID-19
Pandemic”. We are going to explore a deeper
analysis of this article on wikipedia.
EDA
We explored a single page on Wikipedia
to gather general information from the COVID
pandemic of deaths, recovery rate, by country.
We explored that Mexico had a much larger
death rate with Covid than any other country
recorded. This could be due to the health care
system in Mexico. This result was expected.We also gathered the text and citation
data from thirteen articles that contained
“Covid” in the title on wikipedia. The articles
contained similar citations/references to popular
trusted articles outside the online community.
We also gathered 1,000 articles on
wikipedia and their pageview counts. We
analyzed the daily pageviews for popular articles
and compared them to significant dates within
the past year to see if there were any trends.
[
Figure 1
]: Top 10 COVID-19 related articles in
Wikipedia with the most average pageview
[
Figure 2
]: Daily pageview for article
COVID-19 pandemic in 2020
We can see from our data, [Figure 1],
that the most popular articles related are
comprehensive covid-19 pages as well as some
pages for  important figures through the whole
period. Looking at those tops and the plot of
COVID-19 pandemic daily pageview [Figure 2],
we can see that the pageview popularity is
related with the COVID-19 pandemic in the
United States, which makes sense as most of
English readers are from America. However,
India users seem to also contribute to the
pageview here as the pandemic issue in India is
also concerned according to our data. This guide
us about our future investigation on the
information Wikipedia is providing.
Besides the separate Wikipedia page
view data, we also count the total pageview for
those 1000 popular articles in the year 2020.
387,176,891 pageviews combined for those
articles, which is smaller than our expectation.
Since John Hopkins University’s website
exceeds 1 billion visits in January 2021 to their
Coronavirus page. That is to say,  the whole
Wikipedia COVID-19 project is not as popular
as the John Hopkins University’s website.
Furthermore, we also explored editing
history data on important COVID-19 related
pages in 2020,  and according to our first
investigation, it looks like a few editors
contribute to the majority of the work in making
those articles.
[
Figure 3
]: Contribution for top100 editors in
some important COVID-19 articles
[
Figure 4
]: Contribution for top10 editors in
some important COVID-19 articles
We can observe from [Figure 4] that
even if we only choose top10 editors, they still
make a lot of contribution to the formations of
those articles.
Therefore, we want to make a further
look into those editing data and making
investigation on who are responsible for those
editing contents
Methods
We are choosing methods that are going
to allow us to see if Wikipedia data is similar to
other reliable sources. We are going to analyze
their text and editing data, as well as do an
analysis into specific popular covid articles,
comparing them to more commonly known and
trusted researchers.
We are going to incorporate deep data
analysis with topic models to see what
Wikipedia is focusing on and how they differ
from some other websites like JHU (John
Hopkins University) or WHO. That is to say, we
are going to analyze the editing history of
Wikipedia and the contents those websites have.
We are using word clouds to show the main
contents for three different websites (Wikipedia
Coronavirus page, JHU, and WHO), and use
LDA (latent dirichlet allocation) model to
analyze the topic talked by Wikipedia
COVID-19 pandemic page.  However, to
provide more insight on the Wikipedia
COVID-19 page, and find out how they provide
intended contents, we need to make more
investigation on the editing history. We will
study the composition of both editors and
revisions and use LDA models on the revision
comment to see how those editors
collaboratively make contributions to the
COVID-19 articles.
Results/Analysis
Initially, we decided to analyze
Wikipedia’s “Coronavirus” article page by
utilizing topic modeling. Specifically, we
implemented the Latent Dirichlet Allocation
method, or LDA, of topic modeling to view the
most salient terms for given topics within the
Coronavirus article (The above one, treated as
Figure 5).
However, after clustering the frequency
of terms under certain topics, we noticed that
topic 1 contained 99.8% of tokens, which means
that 99.8% of all terms within the Coronavirus
article were found in topic 1. We find that this
article is constantly talking about coronavirus
and the properties of this virus.
In order to compare the content
provided by different websites, we choose to use
a simple way to visualize the content of different
websites: word cloud. The results are shown
below.
[
Figure 6
]: Word Cloud for the John Hopkins
University website.
Taken from the main page on the coronavirus
center. This figure shows how prevalent they are
spreading the vaccine. You can also see the word
John Hopkins used frequently.
[
Figure 7
]: Word Cloud for the John Hopkins
University website using the set of its own
words as stopwords.
[
Figure 8
]: Word Cloud for the WHO website,
the most popular word is vaccine.
Considering most posts on social media site
vaccine information with the WHO, this is
expected. We don’t see the word covid at all or
coronavirus, we do see the word COVID appear
as a stop word in this case.
[
Figure 9
]: Word Cloud for the WHO website
using the set of its own words as stopwords.
According to [
Figure 9
], Covid and disease
appear in the stopwords, whereas they didn’t in
the other two.
[
Figure 10
]: Word Cloud for the Wikipedia
Coronavirus article
[
Figure 11
]: Word Cloud for the Wikipedia
Coronavirus article using the set of its own
words as stopwords.
It appears there is more information on [
Figure
11
] where the virus actually is, using a lot of
terminology, rather than discussing the vaccine.
Wikipedia has a separate page for numbers that
are updated on deaths/recovery rates across the
globe.
We also investigated the editing history
and editor composition in 2020 for three
important articles we choose, which are:
Coronavirus, COVID-19 pandemic and
COVID-19 pandemic by country and territory.
The reasons why we choose those three articles
are that they are both representative while
providing enough information. For example, the
COVID-19 pandemic page has 23500 revision
history alone in the past 2020. Additionally, we
are using comments instead of contents when
conducting the LDA model as contents are
usually redundant/providing meaningless
information while the comments can accurately
tell us what those editors are doing.
[
Figure 12
]: Contribution composition in the
edits made by them for top10 editors in the
article “Coronavirus”
[
Figure 13
]: Contribution composition in the
edits made by them for top10 editors in article
“COVID-19 pandemic by country and territory”
[
Figure 14
]: Contribution composition in the
edits made by them for top10 editors in article
“COVID-19 pandemic”
As we have discussed in the EDA part,
the top 10/100 editors contribute a lot in making
those COVID-19 related articles. However, if we
look closer, we can find that not only few editors
contribute a lot in editing them, but some of the
articles have a “main contributor” who makes
significant contributions to the editing work
there. “Guest2625” edits nearly half of the editor
work in the editing work made by top10 editors
in the article “Coronavirus” , while the editor
“Pigsonthewing” works over a quarter of the edit
works in the top10 for the article “COVID-19
pandemic by country and territory”. But the
COVID-19 pandemic article does not have a
“main contributor” and it has much more
revision history in 2020. The “Coronavirus”
page has only 1500 revisions, and the
“COVID-19 pandemic by country and territory”
page has 5000 revisions. But, the “COVID-19
pandemic” page has 23500 revisions. It looks
like the more frequently edited an article is, the
more equal contributions every editor has, which
is good in editing work as they are applying
more crowd resourcing. In other words,
Wikipedia actually does not apply crowd
resourcing well on its COVID-19 project except
some big articles like “COVID-19 pandemic”.
Now, to further investigate what editors
When they were making edits, we applied the
LDA model on those edit comments with 10
topics, and the tables below (Treated as Figure
15,16,17) are our results.
Looking at those editing topic models, we can
find several interesting discoveries.
“Coronavirus” article seems to have a lot of
revisions which are not about the contents but
the arrangement of the article page, as its topic
4,8,10 are basically talking about some
professional terms in editing wikipedia.
However, if we look at the “COVID-19
pandemic by country and territory”, we can find
that most of their revision works involve certain
countries or areas and some revision terms do
not show up as important as those countries.
This tells us that this article, with more revision
records, is focusing more on making quality
contents instead of doing some arrangement
stuff.
The most meaningful part of the LDA
analysis on edit history is the result we get on
the “COVID-19 pandemic” article. Due to its
significantly large amount of revision records, it
has great diversity in topics. They are not only
talking about events happening in some major
countries/areas in this pandemic, but the editors
also care about format and other arrangement
issues in this article. But the most important part
I think is the Topic 4 this article has, as the
editors are working on dealing with
“misinformation” and “disinformation”. This is
a great difference between a crowd-resourcing
platform and a professional website as the
former one has a lot more editors who care about
fighting with misinformation. However, as we
have seen in the whole LDA result, this is not
always the case for Wikipedia articles. It seems
that the more revisions an article has the more
concern on content quality it will get, since the
number of edit records is ranked as
“Coronavirus”(1500) <”COVID-19 pandemic by
country and territory”(5000)<”COVID-19
pandemic”(23500).
Conclusion
Before we start our research, we assume
that Wikipedia will be performing better than
traditional websites as it can provide diverse
information with crowd-sourcing to keep
misinformation from happening. However, as we
explored more and more into the actual contents
of those websites, we realized that it is difficult
to conclude whether Wikipedia is performing
better or worse. First of all, Wikipedia does not
have a similar level of popularity compared to
the traditional websites like the JHU one as the
top 1000 popular articles in the Wikipedia
coronavirus project. They also have a less
overall total pageview than the JHU one.
Secondly, the contents provided by the website,
according to our word clouds and topic models,
are similar however the WHO focuses more on
vaccine information and distribution. The last
point is, unfortunately, although some of the
Wikipedia articles are using crowd-resourcing to
find against misinformation in COVID-19 topic,
there are still articles who did not utilize this
advantage. According to our research on the
three major coronavirus pages, only the editors
for “COVID-19 pandemic” are collaborating
with each other to provide in-time accurate
information, and the rest two pages are
depending on top active editors or even one
significant contributor. Considering that the top
100 editors for those 3 articles are all making up
a large portion of their edit works, we cannot say
that Wikipedia utilizes crowd-resourcing very
well in this coronavirus project. Especially since
all of the information found on Wikipedia can be
cited from similar credible sources.
Therefore, our final conclusion is that
Wikipedia does have real time, reliable covid
information, but this doesn’t mean we can
generalize it for all information. We cannot
conclude that Wikipedia outperforms traditional
websites as it does not make use of its advantage
well on reporting COVID-19 related
information. We can say that there is less
advertisement for vaccine distribution compared
to the World Health Organization, depending on
what kind of information you want to receive
about the pandemic you may resort to a different
source.Future studies/projects can look into
more Wikipedia articles/sources aside from the
ones that this article looked into to provide more
in-depth information about how Wikipedia
performs in comparison to traditional sites. Also,
instead of using just LDA, future projects can
utilize the other methods found within topic
modeling to see what other results can be
gathered. Lastly, looking into past pandemics
other than covid-19 could differentiate the
difference between Wikipedia and other sources.Works Cited

Abstract
We detail a speciﬁc method that determines how, if at all, sentiment changes over
time for a category of Wikipedia articles, which, in our study, are articles catego-
rized by Wikipedia as LGBT articles. This method uses three different sentiment
analyzers, one for each of the three different language editions of Wikipedia we
are analyzing, to calculate the sentiment of a Wikipedia article, doing so for all
edits in the article’s revision history and for all articles in each language’s LGBT
category. This enables us to calculate a ﬁxed effects regression for each language’s
sentiment scores, allowing us to determine whether or not time has a positive ef-
fect on the articles’ sentiment scores, as well as to compare these trends across
languages.
1 Introduction
With its 20 year history, Wikipedia is not merely
a resource of crowd-sourced information; it is a
reﬂection of changing times and attitudes across
the world, as the deﬁnition of what we consider
”public knowledge” changes with the times. The
signiﬁcance of the last 20 years for social and
political developments in LGBTQ+ representa-
tion also cannot be understated. Within that time,
29 countries around the world have legally rec-
ognized and performed same-sex marriages[2].
Given such advances, we aim to explore their im-
pact on Wikipedia data.
Other papers also seek to understand Wikipedia
data in relation to LGBTQ+ representation.
”Multilingual Contextual Affective Analysis of
LGBT People Portrayals in Wikipedia” per-
forms contextual affective analysis to examine
the Wikipedia pages for LGBTQ+ individuals
across different languages: Russian, English,
and Spanish. This paper primarily seeks to
identify the nuanced language individuals with
LGBTQ+ identities or ties are discussed, and
performs this by measuring the connotation ofcommon verbs in the ﬁelds of agency, power,
and sentiment in said articles. Using the con-
notation frames, “lexicons of verbs annotated to
elicit implications,” for study helps frame a lan-
guage’s unconscious bias[3]; however, our team
primarily concerns ourselves with focus on sen-
timent. This somewhat narrows our scope of nu-
anced analysis, but allows us to identify broader
trends in the data. In addition, unlike this paper,
we want to look at changes in these trends.
In our analysis, we attempt to measure and quan-
tify this change for articles related to LGBTQ+
issues. Speciﬁcally, we wish to understand these
changes in different languages, so we can cross-
compare trends. The languages we choose to fo-
cus on are English, Spanish, and Chinese.
2 Methodology
The ﬁrst step in our analysis is identifying the
pages on which to perform analysis. Wikipedia
has article categories which help us to identify
which pages are relevant to our analysis. How-
ever, after investigating the articles marked un-
1der the ”LGBT” Wikipedia category, we found
that the sheer volume of pages which are marked
”LGBT”, as well as the fact that not all of them
are strongly related to what we’re looking for,
means that a slightly more manual approach is
necessary. We chose to manually select a num-
ber of sub-categories to analyze based on cate-
gory size and article relevancy. This serves the
purpose of being manual enough for us to tweak
our selection to be as relevant and small as we
need it to be, while also being automatic enough
so that we don’t have to pick through articles one
by one. After this, we query Wikipedia for the
edit data for each page. Holding all this data in
RAM at once is impossible, so each page’s edit
history is saved locally for sentiment analysis.
Each page’s edit history is stored as a separate
JSON ﬁle. We chose this approach over a single
large JSON ﬁle as it makes it easier to imple-
ment parallelization in both this and the follow-
ing step.
Language Article Count
Spanish 1606
Chinese 992
English 913
Table 1: Number of Articles for Each Language
Once the page histories are stored, we can begin
analyzing the sentiment for each edit, for each
page. This is as simple as loading each edit his-
tory and looping through the edits, running the
relevant language’s sentiment analyzer. To keep
this code as clean as possible, a wrapper class is
used for sentiment analysis. This has the added
beneﬁt of making the pipeline easily extensible,
as all this analysis can be done for any other
language once an analyzer for that language is
added to the sentiment analysis wrapper class.
The results for all pages are stored in a single
json ﬁle after this step, as opposed to multiple
ﬁles. This is done for two reasons: A single ﬁle
is easier to transfer between machines; and we
no longer need to worry about parallelization af-
ter this step. The single ﬂoat which symbolizes
sentiment is much smaller than the strings which
represent article text, so RAM isn’t a problem
anymore either.
Finally, the data is moved into a Pandas
DataFrame for ﬁxed effects regression. This
helps us control for the level of heterogeneity
between articles (the difference in views, and
therefore edits, between Wikipedia articles can
be astronomical) as well as pinpoint which ar-
ticles are having the most change in sentiment
and when. The timestamps from the sentimentjson ﬁle are converted to years in order for us to
calculate the average and median sentiments for
an article per year, as we are aiming to calcu-
late trends over years rather than over seconds,
which is the granularity of timestamp data. In
order to complete the ﬁxed effects regression,
we create dummy variables for each article in
the data, making sure to drop the ﬁrst column
(which represents an article) to avoid the issue of
multicollinearity as best as possible. The depen-
dent variable of the regression is the previously
calculated average sentiment score and the inde-
pendent variables are the year column and all the
dummy variable columns. We additionally cal-
culate a second ﬁxed effects regression, with the
only change being the dependent variable is now
the median sentiment score. We do this to see if
the effect of outliers in the sentiment score data
is signiﬁcant enough to change the result of the
regression.
3 Analysis
Our analysis primarily deals with sentiment cal-
culated in our JSON Data. To get this data,
ﬁrst, we collect the article’s edit history with the
the time and date these edits took place. Next,
we pass the text of the article through a senti-
ment analyzer, which outputs a ﬂoat value rang-
ing from 0 to 1. A value of 0 indicates negative
sentiment, while a value of 1 indicates positive
sentiment. We do this for every revision of the
article so that all edits from its creation up un-
til its most recent edit are covered, and we do
this for all three languages, each with their own,
unique sentiment analyzer.
For every year in 2003-2021 (Wikipedia’s incep-
tion to more recent edits), we calculate the av-
erage sentiment in each language for edits. Our
results do not match our expectations of a posi-
tive and linear sentiment relationship.
The data for the English ﬁles is the most exten-
sive. As shown in Figure 1, there is actually
a decrease in sentiment over time for this data
with a very weak negative correlation. The Span-
ish data (Figure 3) actually shows a greater de-
crease in sentiment. Comparatively, the Chinese
data does not have a simple linear relationship.
Before 2013, the sentiment of these articles in-
creases, and after 2013, it decreases over time.
Our next steps then deal with trying explain these
phenomenon.

timent Edits Over Time

timent Over Time With Age

timent Over Time With Age
Figure 6: Spanish Mean Sen-
timent Over Time WIth Age
4 Results
In our results, we attempt to explain the senti-
ment results that we discovered. In particular,
we look at the age of the articles. After look-
ing at different features of the articles, we ﬁnd
that the age of the articles as a major contribut-
ing factor to the mean sentiments that we saw,
although this is more true for certain languages
than others.
For both the Chinese and the Spanish data, the
means are dragged down by more recent arti-
cles and their sentiment because they act as lower
outliers (Figure 5, Figure 6). This does not oc-
cur in the English sentiment data. There is not a
signiﬁcant difference between newer article sen-
timent and older sentiment; however, this makes
sense as after 2006, the sentiment of English ar-
ticles has no correlation with the year (and even
considering all the years, the found correlation is
not signiﬁcant).
For the full analysis of the aforementioned cate-
gory, we compute the sentiment scores for each
edit of each article and apply ﬁxed effect regres-
sion to the data, as described in the methodology
section. We use both mean and median values to
make sure that outliers are not going to change
our result signiﬁcantly. As seen in Figures 7-
12, across all languages and using both methods
of ﬁxed effects regression explained previously,
time has a weak negative relationship with sen-
timent over time. The sentiment scores are dis-
tributed without any obvious pattern across dif-
ferent languages. The mean and median graphsare not very different from each other, which
means that the outliers in the sentiment data are
not very signiﬁcant. However, in Figure 12, the
regression line for the Median Spanish Senti-
ment Score by Year appears to be closer to 0 than
the regression line for the Mean Spanish Senti-
ment Score by Year in Figure 9, indicating that
the outliers in the Spanish sentiment data skewed
more in the positive direction. This is an in-
dication that the majority of Spanish sentiment
scores were negative, with fewer receiving pos-
itive scores, all hallmarks of a right-skewed dis-
tribution.
5 Discussion
Since we did not analyze every article in the
LGBT category but only one main subcategory,
much work remains to be done for all other
LGBTQ+ related articles. As shown in Table
2, lots of the articles related to the LGBT com-
munity have not been taken into account due to
computing and time constraints. Though our re-
gression shows that time has a weak negative re-
lationship with sentiment over time, it is possi-
ble that other parts of the data may have a differ-
ent pattern that a full study over all the articles
in LGBT category would uncover, as a trend in
one subcategory does not necessarily indicate the
same trend across all other subcategories. As it
will take a very long time to process all the ar-
ticles (approximately weeks), more efﬁcient al-
gorithms are quite necessary to delve into more
widespread analysis.

Another important part that needs improvement
is the cleaning of the texts. There are many dif-
ferent types of non-text contents that should be
removed before sentiment analysis to improve
the scores. We are currently using WikiExtrac-tor[1], but there are still many elements remain-
ing, including links and reference marks (some-
thing like ”[1]”).
Finally, though we dropped the ﬁrst column of
our dummy variable dataframe in an attempt to
avoid the dummy variable trap, the sheer amount
of dummy variables in the dataframe seems to
cause multicollinearity to persist. If this same
analysis were to be done on a larger subcategory,
the problem would only be magniﬁed. Future ap-
proaches to analyzing collections of Wikipedia
articles for sentiment changes over time would
beneﬁt greatly from using methods that would
reduce multicollinearity as much as possible so
that the trend of change over time could be cap-
tured more efﬁciently.

ABSTRACT
 
 
This paper seeks to analyze the degree and
 
prevalence of political bias and controversy in Wikipedia.
 
Using pre-trained models from Rheault and Cochrane (2019)
 
and Shapiro and Gentzkow (2019) we validate our methods
 
for generalizability on the ideological books corpus (Sim et
 
al., 2013) with sub-sentential annotations (Iyyer et al., 2014)
 
and attempt to apply these methods to receive insight into
 
political bias in Wikipedia. We attempt to combat overlap in
 
political slants and avoid labeling political bias whose
 
detection is unavoidable due to the topic of the article in
 
question. With insight into political bias on Wikipedia gained
 
we hope it will be able to prove useful in combating
 
counterproductive activity on Wikipedia and allow for more
 
precise and targeted activity by Wikipedia monitors.
 
 
INTRODUCTION
 
 
As established by Wikipedia itself, edit-warring is
 
remarkably counterproductive and only makes consensus
 
harder to reach. In 
​
Edit Wars in Wikipedia
​
, Robert Sumi et al
 
devised an M-Statistic which can grant any Wikipedia article a
 
value representing its level of controversy; while it can
 
quickly and effectively identify highly controversial articles, it
 
is generalized to take into account any type of edit war (among
 
other limitations), with an accuracy that is far from perfect. In
 
general, this project seeks to address two key deficiencies in
 
this method of conflict detection: scope of controversy and
 
limitation in methods. While the aforementioned method was
 
generalized for any and all edit wars across all topics, this
 
project will focus on political controversy; additionally, our
 
method will detect bias using page content and not just
 
meta-data like the M-statistic.
 
The rationale behind focussing on political
 
controversy is twofold. Firstly, unproductive political
 
controversy and the resulting potential lack of accurate
 
information is known to have severe consequences, and these
 
consequences are particularly salient in these current times. As
 
seen in Greenstein and Zhu’s paper in 2018, bias in Wikipedia
 
is indeed present, and it is both in Wikipedia’s interest and in
 
the interest of the general public for it to be as close as
 
possible to a state of political neutrality and factuality. As a
 
result, lowering controversy in this area becomes particularly
 
salient. Political bias could be a particular method of targeting
 
this— politically charged language is for one unhelpful, but
 
additionally can provoke the other side and lead to additional
 
controversy. Finding a way to neutralize politically charged
 
language could then be helpful in efforts to quell political
 
controversy and focus on neutral, factual information. As for
 
the second rationale, politically biased language has excellent
 
tools available and has already been a topic of study.
 
Identifying ideological language is something that has already
 
been done before; for example Rheault and Cochrane in 
​
Word
 
Embeddings for the Analysis of Ideological Placement in
 
Parliamentary Corpora
​
 successfully uncovered ideology
 
within digitized parliamentary debates.
 
 
There is, however, a lack of Wikipedia-focused bias
 
research, which is unacceptable considering the importance
 
and popularity of the website. Wikipedia itself only mentions
 
three major papers written on the subject of ideological bias:
 
Gentzkow and Shapiro (2012), Greenstein, Zhu, and Gu
 
(2016), Greenstein and Zhu (2018). Upon further examination,
 
the models used for those papers were trained on
 
non-Wikipedia data, which made us question the validity of
 
their findings. Wikipedia is completely unlike any other data
 
source when it comes to its data generation process, and
 
therefore it is hard to tell whether a model trained on
 
newspapers or congressional speeches would produce valid
 
results when applied to Wikipedia articles. The above
 
mentioned papers address this problem in their own ways, for
 
example, Greenstein and Zhu apply their model to both
 
Wikipedia and Encyclopedia Britannica and perform
 
comparative analysis, which reduces the potential harm of
 
model overfitting. However, since we wanted to focus our
 
research on Wikipedia, we attempted to mitigate the problem
 
by using two different models and comparing their
 
performances on the same set of data.
 
We apply the models to a subset of articles and
 
measure the ideological bias of the current versions as well as
 
revision histories of those articles in order to gauge the level
 
of ideological slant across topics and throughout time.
 
 
DATA
 
 
For this project we had three main sources of data.
 
The two models we employed were both trained using data
 
from transcripts of congressional speeches. Most studies we
 
found on measuring political/ideological bias use
 
congressional data: there is a lot of it and it is easy to get a
 
political slant label on every speech by identifying the political
 
affiliation of each speaker. This data was then transformed
 
once by Shapiro & Gentzkow (2019) with available two-word
 
phrases and their political association, and second by Rheault
 
and Cochrane (2019) with pre-trained models available on
 
GitHub 
​
https://github.com/lrheault/partyembed
​
 for download.
 
As mentioned above, there is a real risk of the models being
 
overfit to congressional speeches, so we had to acquire a
 
validation dataset that was generated by a different process
 
than the congressional dataset. Ideally, our validation set
 
would come from Wikipedia itself, however, we could not
 
come up with a way to algorithmically extract labels from
 
Wikipedia data. Our best attempt was to look for article edits
 
tagged with comments containing the word “bias”, under the
 
assumption that such edits point out and replace ideologically
 
slanted phrases with more neutral language. However, this
 
approach turned out to be too inconsistent, so we had to find
 
some other dataset with bias labels.
  
While looking into previous ideological slant
 
research we found a rigorously compiled dataset called the
 
Ideological Books Corpus (IBC) (Sim et al., 2013) with
 
sub-sentential annotations (Iyyer et al., 2014). IBC is a
 
collection of sentences labelled with left/right/neutral political
 
ideology compiled from books and magazine articles by
 
authors with well-known political leanings. Initially, we
 
intended to use this dataset to train our own bias-detection
 
model, however, due to the careful compilation process, IBC
 
contains only around 4300 total sentences (2025 liberal
 
sentences, 1701 conservative sentences, 600 neutral sentences)
 
which is too little data for a new model, so instead we used it
 
to validate the generalizability of the models trained on
 
congress speeches. While there is no reason to assume that the
 
phrases from IBC are in any way more representative of the
 
“Wikipedian dialect” than the congress speeches, the data
 
generation process is still different enough for us to be able to
 
spot overfitting. This dataset was downloaded from
 
https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer/ibc/index.html
​
, with
 
sample data available publicly for download and the full
 
dataset available via email. If one were to reproduce our
 
experiments, they must first email the address posted on the
 
website and request access to the full dataset.
 
The third dataset was extracted from our main source
 
of interest, Wikipedia. At first we wanted to analyze the
 
entirety of Wikipedia, however, with over 6 million articles to
 
consider we were risking infeasible runtime lengths for our
 
timeline. Besides, our models were trained on data pertaining
 
to U.S. politics specifically, so the results on unrelated articles
 
would have been even less trustworthy. Therefore, we decided
 
to only focus on U.S. politics-related articles. Wikipedia’s
 
category system is inconsistent and none of the previous
 
approaches to this task were usable for different reasons, so
 
we had to find some other method or resource to help with the
 
selection process. We ended up settling on the list we found
 
on a U.S. Politics “task force” page. Task forces on Wikipedia
 
are voluntary collaborations focused on improving different
 
parts of the website, and the task force we got the list from
 
specializes in Wikipedia's coverage of the U.S. Politics. The
 
list we got from their dedicated page contained the top 700
 
most-viewed U.S. politics-related Wikipedia articles, which
 
served our purpose well for two reasons. First, it was small
 
enough so that we could be flexible about which models we
 
used and which statistics we generated since our code did not
 
take too long to run. Second, the more popular pages are
 
usually more developed, so we were able to study the results
 
of more active collaborations, which is what Wikipedia was
 
intended for. We scraped the current versions of almost all the
 
articles from the list (with few exceptions such as list articles),
 
and then manually picked out 9 of them for further
 
examination of their revision histories based on length
 
(short-medium-long) and current bias scores
 
(left-neutral-right). We used article length because we found it
 
to be the best available estimator for the number of edits, or
 
how well the article is developed, and got edit counts ranging
 
from 800 to 8000.
 
One of the aforementioned models we’re using, the
 
pre-trained model by Rheault and Cochrane, is available on
 
github as partyembed. A key function of this model that we
 
are able to use for our task is the “issue” function- this
 
provides us with data created by their trained model. The
 
vocabulary of this model is associated with different weights
 
of positive or negative democratic and republican slants, from
 
congressional speeches from every two years from 1873 to
 
2015.
 
 
 
Fig 1. Overall Slants of congressional speech data from each
 
party for each year.
 
 
Ultimately, belief in the efficacy of this data is
 
relatively certain, as the model performs excellently at
 
distinguishing the ideological placement of its corpora.
 
However, what we intend to do is analyze if this data can be
 
generalized, which will be explored further in Methods.
 
 
 
METHODS
 
 
Wikipedia is one of the most unique data sources out
 
there just by the nature of the data generation process. The
 
articles are written by the combined efforts of tens and
 
hundreds of different editors, each with their own writing style
 
and ideology, which automatically brings up the question: are
 
models trained on data from congress speeches, or books, or
 
magazines general enough to be applied to Wikipedia data? As
 
mentioned above, validating the performance of the models on
 
Wikipedia data is not a trivial task, and we did not find the
 
previous research to address this problem sufficiently.
 
Therefore, we are employing two different methods of
 
validation. Firstly, we use the IBC to assert both models’
 
generalizability by checking how accurate they are at labelling
 
the sentences from the dataset. Secondly, since we are using
 
two different models, we are able to compare their
 
performances on the Wikipedia data, which allows us to make
 
sure the methodology does not affect the results too
 
drastically.
 
The first model we use was developed by Gentzkow,
 
Shapiro and Taddy for their paper 
​
Measuring Group
 
Differences in High-Dimensional Choices. 
​
The model uses a
 
neural net to assign bias scores to two-word phrases, or
 
bigrams. We then use the resulting score dictionary to assign
 
bias scores to bigrams in the selected Wikipedia articles.
 
While there are many different ways to map the resulting array
 
of numbers to a single representative value, we decided to go
 
with summing all the bias values together, effectively getting
 
the formula:
 
  
c

r

(
a
)

(

Where 
 is a unique word/bigram in the list of words/bigrams
x
 
 derived from a Wikipedia article 
. The article text was
S
a
 
pre-processed the same way Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Taddy
 
pre-processed the congressional speeches in order to ensure
 
consistency. That includes removing punctuation and
 
stopwords, lowercasing, and porter-stemming the whole text.
 
At this stage we already spot the first signs of
 
unreliability: about 22% of the articles have one of the top 10
 
frequent phrases in the title. That means that there is a
 
possibility of the results being skewed by the topics of the
 
articles. So, for example, if the phrase “San Francisco” is
 
considered left-biased by the model, an article about San
 
Francisco will receive a high bias score even if the language
 
used is not biased. Upon further investigation, we found that
 
the top 10 most frequent phrases constitute around 42% of the
 
article’s absolute bias score on average, while also being
 
thematically connected to the article’s topic. A telling example
 
of this phenomenon is the article for Martin Luther King (fig.
 
2).
 
 
 
 
Fig. 2. Table of the most frequent phrases for the MLK article
 
with counts, bias scores and absolute total scores.
 
 
As can be seen from the figure, the top 10 most
 
common words are connected to MLK’s biography. In this
 
particular case their combined score constitutes over 56% of
 
the whole article’s absolute score. We call this propensity of
 
an article’s score to be skewed by topically connected words
 
and phrases “topic bias”. In order to combat topic bias we
 
decided to ignore the top 10 most common phrases while
 
calculating the articles’ scores, the formula effectively
 
becoming:

Where

a
 
one of many possible ways, the problem is deep enough to
 
warrant a whole another investigation. However, even with
 
this solution about 27% of the articles ended up reclassified,
 
which could mean that this method is at least somewhat
 
effective.
 
Additionally, we decided to normalize the articles
 
around their length by dividing the total score by the number
 
of words the article contains. Although the data does not show
 
a strong correlation between the article’s score and its length
 
(fig.3), we still decided to make that adjustment since it might
 
help to further combat topic bias: the longer articles may still
 
contain more topically-skewing words than the shorter
 
articles. The final formula we went with is:

​
this model was created by, in using each word in
 
each sentence in our validation set (The Ideological Books
 
Corpus (Sim et al., 2013) with sub-sentential annotations
 
(Iyyer et al., 2014)), extracting the weights from house
 
corpora from 2007 onwards from the pre-trained model. Ergo,
 
for each word in each item in the ideological books corpus, if
 
this word existed in the vocabulary of Rheault and Cochrane’s
 
pre-trained model, we received the democratic and republican
 
total leanings for each year. After applying this to one
 
particular sentence, we are then left with an array of values.
 
With these, we were then able to explore different aggregate
 
functions for each sentence.

from 2015 house corpora on ideological books corpus data, 1
 
sentence
  
 
Overall, when we looked at individual sentences, we
 
found that there was a concerning amount of overlap. While
 
the scores did indeed differ in the correct directions, the
 
overlap itself was quite worrisome. However, under the
 
justification that most Wikipedia articles have multiple
 
sentences, we tried the same model with samples of multiple
 
sentences.

from 2015 house corpora on ideological books corpus data, 30
 
sentences
 
 
The Gentzkow/Shapiro/Taddy model performed
 
similarly when applied to the IBC: with only 1 sentence inputs
 
we got an average classification accuracy of 40% (worse than
 
even picking at random), however, as we fed more sentences
 
into the model we started getting way better results, the
 
average spiking up to almost 70%. It could be argued that 70%
 
accuracy is not very reliable, but that is why we have a second
 
layer of validation with inter-model comparisons.
 
 
 
Overall, we chose the mean as our aggregate
 
function, as other aggregate methods, such as the Maximum,
 
often had strange formations in the distributions

RESULTS
 
 
When analyzing the results of the two models on
 
current page articles, our first objective was to explore the
 
models’ similarities and differences. We first noticed a
 
moderate correlation between the output scores of the two
 
models, that is, 0.285213. When looking further into the
 
differences, we found that overall the differences were
 
somewhat normally distributed, with Partyembed overall
 
giving somewhat more liberal scores, resulting in a right skew.
 
 
Fig 7. Distribution of score differences (Gentzkow and
 
Shapiro score subtracted from Partyembed score)
 
 
Generally, there seemed to be a not-insignificant
 
amount of disagreement between the two models, which made
 
itself particularly clearer when plotting the scores
 
side-by-side.

sorted)
 
 
Fig 9. Comparison of scores across articles (with G&S sorted)
 
 
 
 
Fig 10. Comparison of scores, scatterplot
 
 
Fortunately, the differences in scores were not
 
entirely random, and there appeared to be patterns within the
 
types of articles with large or small differences. The largest
 
differences has a large number of individuals mentioned,
 
particularly representatives and politicians.
 
 
Fig 11. Articles with largest difference between models
 
 
Meanwhile, the smallest differences had a noticeable
 
number of articles concerning presidential elections featured.
  
 
Fig 12. Articles with smallest difference between models
 
 
However, these patterns aside, there were many
 
articles whose large differences can be areas for concern, such
 
as “Political positions of the Democratic Party” and “Blue
 
Lives Matter.” Moreover, figures and politicians are of course
 
not excluded from the articles with the lowest differences.
 
 
Regardless, an area we were particularly interested in
 
was the most politically slanted articles. Here, the results were
 
quite different by each model.
 
For the most left-leaning articles identified by the
 
partyembed model, it made us quite concerned over whether
 
or not our aforementioned strategy was effective in avoiding
 
our models acting as a topic detector.
 
These articles were heavily centered around
 
left-leaning topics, such as the article for “Civil rights
 
movement” and “New Deal coalition”. While this could
 
possibly mean that these articles were in fact written with a
 
left-leaning slant, it could also mean our article could not
 
avoid being a topic detector when it is applied to these
 
particular kinds of Wikipedia articles.
 
 
Fig 13. Most left-leaning articles identified by partyembed
 
model
 
 
As for the right-leaning articles, the partyembed
 
model identified interesting choices. For instance, although
 
our method for applying the partyembed model to Wikipedia
 
articles used data from 2007 onwards, it consistently identified
 
articles relating to Trump and Russia, data only relevant for
 
the very end of the data selection. What’s more, it is quite
 
likely that democrats too were talking about the Mueller
 
investigation, etc. So these results were particularly
 
perplexing.
 
Another interesting result within the right-leaning
 
articles (though not the most right-leaning articles) was the
 
prevalence of conspiracy-related articles. All but one of the
 
articles relating to conspiracies that we found (the exception
 
being the article pertaining to conspiracy theories relating to
 
the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy) each had a
 
right-leaning slant. What’s more is that the majority of these
 
right-leaning slants were not mild, but many were quite
 
noticeably towards the right-wing end. Furthermore, these
 
articles were not all about right-wing conspiracy theories, but
 
included relatively non-partisan theories such as the New
 
World Order.
 
While we are hesitant to make drastic claims about
 
the world from these results, what we could possibly conclude
 
is that the language being used in these conspiracy Wikipedia
 
articles is similar to that being used by republican
 
congresspeople.
 
  
 
Fig 14. Most right-leaning articles identified by partyembed
 
model
 
 
 
Fig 15. Scores of conspiracy-related articles, partyembed
 
 
For the left-leaning articles identified by the Shapiro
 
& Gentzkow model, the current pages revealed many articles
 
centered around individuals, often senators and
 
representatives. As there seems to be less (though still present)
 
representation of left-wing topics within these topmost
 
articles, one could perhaps take away that the S&G approach
 
is more able to avoid topic detection within the most left-wing
 
articles. However, more research would be needed to make
 
sure of this.
 
 
Fig 16. Topmost left-wing articles, G&S
 
 
On the other hand, the most right-wing articles were
 
more of a mix. Like partyembed, the topmost right-wing
 
articles did include a number of articles pertaining to Trump
 
and Russia, such as the articles for Mueller report and Michael
 
Flynn. However, there was also a lower representation of
 
articles pertaining to right-wing topics. While the former
 
included articles such as “Bible belt,” “Flags of the
 
Confederate States of America,” “Taxation in the United
 
States,”, “Jefferson Davis,”, and “Barack Obama Religion
 
Conspiracy Theories”, the latter included far fewer articles
 
such as “Newsmax,” “Donald Trump 2016 presidential
 
campaign.” With this common trend in both left and right
 
wing, one could possibly take away the message that the
 
Gentzkow & Shapiro approach performs slightly better at
 
avoiding topic detection overall.
 
As to why this is, it is still difficult to say. Both had
 
their original sources in generally the same data-
 
congressional corpora. And both of these methods tended to
 
have the same approach in differentiating the ideology behind
 
the two different documents. One of the main differences, as
 
small as it is, is that the Gentzkow & Shapiro approach uses
 
bigrams, whereas we used unigrams for the issue() function in
 
our application of the partyembed model.
 
  
 
Fig 16. Topmost right-wing articles, G&S
 
 
 
Time-series analysis
 
 
An area in which there was a noticeable amount of
 
disagreement was that of the time series analysis. When
 
analyzing the plots side-by-side, some articles featured
 
drastically different interpretations of the change of our
 
selected articles. While many articles had modest positive
 
correlations with each other and generally looked quite
 
similar, other articles such as “Separation of Church and
 
State” seemed to have opposite interpretations of the lifespan
 
of an article, with overall ratings of bias moving in entirely
 
opposite directions, as seen in Figure 13 below.
 
 
Fig 17. Article with high disagreement - Separation of Church
 
and State time series slant plot (Partyembed on left, G&S on
 
right)
 
 
However, one noticeable trend was that for the
 
majority of articles, (Jim Acosta and Democratic Party being
 
the only two exceptions) the majority of the variation in an
 
article’s bias rating was typically found at the very beginning
 
of its lifespan. One of the more drastic examples of these
 
(Mueller Report) can be found in Figure 14
 
 
 
Fig 18. Mueller Report time-series slant plot (Partyembed on
 
left, G&S on right)
 
 
This makes sense intuitively, if article lengths
 
generally increase over their lifespan, slanted edits of around
 
the same size will typically have less and less of an impact as
 
time goes on.
 
Another finding we found was the “stair step”
 
movements of the various plots. We assume that these are the
 
results of large chunks of the article being added or taken
 
away.
 
 
Fig 19. Large stair step motions on the article for James K.
 
Polk (partyembed on left, G&S on right)
 
 
 
Another object of interest to us was the varying
 
ranges of scores over time— if these ranges were similar, or
 
different in some pattern, etc. In general, we found that the
 
range of scores given to an article over its span varied wildly.
  
 
Fig 20. Score Ranges for the nine time-series articles
 
(partyembed)
 
 
When looking at the ranges for the scores of each of
 
the articles in question, the articles with the largest variation in
 
scores were in fact so large as to obscure the patterns in any of
 
the smaller ranges (Figure 16).
 
When analyzing the score ranges that seemed closer
 
together (that is, after dropping the three articles with the
 
highest variation, “James K. Polk,” “Separation of Church and
 
State,” and “The Era of Good Feelings”), we found that even
 
then, the ranges in scores varied substantially.
 
 
Fig 21. Score ranges for six articles (partyembed)
 
 
Overall, the variation does not seem to be related to
 
the overall slant or the size of the article. The largest
 
variations were with a long-neutral article, medium-republican
 
article, and short-neutral article. The smallest variations were
 
in a long-republican article, medium-neutral article, and
 
medium-democratic article.
 
 
 
 
 
CONCLUSION
 
 
The two political parties in the U.S. utilize diverging
 
vocabularies. Democrats are likely to use left-leaning term
 
“undocumented immigrants” while Republicans are likely to
 
use the right-leaning term “illegal aliens”. Ideological
 
divisions are increasing and pervasive. There is a distinct
 
political polarization of language used in congressional
 
speeches as preliminarily explored by Rheault and Cochrane.
 
Since congressional speeches feed media and public discourse,
 
this growing partisanship of language can then find its way
 
onto open-source resources such as Wikipedia. Extreme
 
political opinions can have reverberating consequences and
 
Wikipedia has expressed its desire to remain factually neutral.
 
Our work expands upon the papers by Rheault and Cochrane
 
and Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Taddy by applying their methods
 
to Wikipedia, one of the most visited websites in the world for
 
free public information.
 
In this paper, we develop and compare two models to
 
detect and measure ideological slant on Wikipedia across
 
article topics and throughout time. Both models are trained on
 
congressional speech data, validated using the Ideological
 
Books Corpus, and applied to the 700 most-viewed articles
 
related to U.S. politics. Model validity increases with respect
 
to the number of sentences and both models produced similar
 
results. Over 62 percent of article scores had an absolute
 
difference less than 0.1. The only area where the models
 
differed was on articles regarding political figures, such as
 
congresspeople. Generally, the models agree on abstract
 
political articles. A particularly surprising result is that both
 
the models consistently identified articles related to Trump
 
and Russia as right-leaning.
 
Our main issue of concern is that the Partyembed
 
model, originally designed by Rheault and Cochrane, acts
 
more like a topic detector. Topic bias is more prevalent in the
 
Partyembed model than in the Gentzkow & Shapiro model.
 
For example, the most left-leaning articles identified by
 
Partyembed are heavily centered around left-leaning topics.
 
On the other hand, the most left-leaning and right-leaning
 
articles identified by the Gentzkow & Shapiro model feature a
 
variety of topics. In order to determine if the Gentzkow &
 
Shapiro model performs better than Partyembed we would
 
need to do more research.
 
Measuring ideological slant is a core topic in political
 
science and a daunting task for data scientists. Not only can
 
Wikipedia use these two models to determine the degree of
 
political bias in their articles, but political scientists can use
 
the quantitative finding of this paper when examining shifts in
 
public opinion. While we were able to apply two predeveloped
 
models to Wikipedia data, they can be improved upon. In the
 
future, we would like to implement a bias detector that does
 
not get swayed by the topic at hand by possibly altering the
 
training/validation data.

APPENDIX
 
 
Project Proposal
 
As established by Wikipedia itself, edit-warring is
 
remarkably counterproductive and only makes consensus
 
harder to reach. In Edit Wars in Wikipedia, Robert Sumi et al
 
devised an M-Statistic which can grant any Wikipedia article a
 
value representing its level of controversy; while it can
 
quickly and effectively identify highly controversial articles, it
 
is generalized to take into account any type of edit war (among
 
other limitations), with an accuracy that is far from perfect. In
 
general, this project seeks to address two key deficiencies in
 
this method of conflict detection: scope of controversy and
 
limitation in methods. While the aforementioned method was
 
generalized for any and all edit wars across all topics, this
 
project will focus on political controversy; while the
 
aforementioned method solely focussed on edit wars, this will
 
combine that with sentiment analysis.
 
 
The rationale behind focussing on political
 
controversy is twofold. Firstly, unproductive political
 
controversy and the resulting potential lack of accurate
 
information is known to have severe consequences, and these
 
consequences are particularly salient in these current times. As
 
seen in Greenstein and Zhu’s paper in 2018, bias in Wikipedia
 
is indeed present, and it is both in Wikipedia’s interest and in
 
the interest of the general public for it to be as close as
 
possible to a state of political neutrality and factuality. As a
 
result, lowering controversy in this area becomes particularly
 
salient. Political bias could be a particular method of targeting
 
this— politically charged language is for one unhelpful, but
 
additionally can provoke the other side and lead to additional
 
controversy. Finding a way to neutralize politically charged
 
language could then be helpful in efforts to quell political
 
controversy and focus on neutral, factual information. As for
 
the second rationale, politically biased language has excellent
 
tools available and has already been a topic of study.
 
Identifying ideological language is something that has already
 
been done before; for example Rheault and Cochrane in Word
 
Embeddings for the Analysis of Ideological Placement in
 
Parliamentary Corpora successfully uncovered ideology
 
within digitized parliamentary debates. As for what tool we
 
will use, we will have to do further research as to which tool
 
will be most effective (see Schedule, Week 1), however for
 
now we are planning to train a model on the ideological books
 
corpus (Sim et al, 2013) and attempt to generalize this to
 
Wikipedia articles, validating it on edit comments which
 
explicitly mention reverting bias.
 
 
In order to confirm the relationship between
 
politically charged language and controversy, we could run the
 
chosen model on full article text and talk pages. In order to get
 
the data for these pages, full data of all of Wikipedia is
 
regularly uploaded to Wikimedia downloads. From here we
 
can download full revision history in order to perform analysis
 
of controversy if we decide to use a similar reversion analysis
 
as we did with the M-Statistic. This data contains the full text
 
of each revision of each article, as well as information
 
concerning the time of the edit and the user behind this edit.
 
From this, we can hash the text and take note of the time and
 
the user. As for the talk pages, these are available in the
 
“meta-current” rendition. We can match the titles with those
 
of the full history in order to join these sets together. From
 
here, we can perform sentiment analysis on the current article
 
as well as the talk page. As for what this data looks like, it is
 
in a similar format to the standard article XML data, but topics
 
and comments are all denoted with textual symbols (topics
 
starting and ending with “==” and comments with “:”), and the
 
title of these pages connect to the current page in the format
 
“Talk: Original_Article_Title”. Joining all of this data, then,
 
should be quite simple, as is downloading it all. The majority
 
of the work, therefore, will be in manipulating and
 
transforming this data.
 
 
We are also interested in exploring the relation of
 
clickstream data with political bias. If we can find an
 
association with traffic to and from a particular article and the
 
political bias of this article, this can lead to more efficient
 
detection of politically biased articles. This clickstream data is
 
freely available as well. It consists of (referrer, referee) pairs,
 
in addition to the number of times this pair appears in the data.
 
While we cannot make larger chains beyond this with absolute
 
certainty, we can still gain an idea of from where people are
 
arriving to these articles, and where they are going. From
 
these clicks, only about 62% are internal, but it should still
 
provide us with plenty of information about the nature of the
 
users. As for the number of times these pairs appear, there is a
 
median of 24 clicks, a mean of 92.6, skew of 126, 90%
 
quantile of 143 and a max of 220000 clicks; the data is very
 
much right-skewed and with very serious outliers.
 
 
Overall, after gathering all of our insights from this
 
research, we intend to create a bot that could effectively find
 
politically charged Wikipedia articles and notify editors of the
 
issue. We intend to create it such that it is able to point out
 
specific lines that are particularly biased, or perhaps even
 
suggest possible corrections that are less politically charged.
 
This bot could then be set to run periodically in order to
 
identify these problematic phrases. And regardless of the
  
creation of this bot, all insights will be compiled into a paper
 
in order to communicate our findings.

Introduction
 
Opioids
are
now
one
of
the
most
common
causes
of
accidental
death
in
the
US.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
According
to
the
CDC,
two
out
of
three
drug
overdose
deaths
in
2018
involved
an
opioid
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
[11]​
,
so
opioid
abuse
can
not
only
affect
people
physically
and
mentally
but
can
also
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
deprive
their
lives
​
[1]​
.
Opioid
addiction
has
a
unique
background
in
that
a
large
reason
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
why
people
become
addicted
is
that
patients
in
hospitals
are
often
prescribed
opioids
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
treat
pain,
however
these
patients
wind
up
misusing
their
prescriptions
and
become
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
addicted. ​
[12]
 
The
growing
severity
of
opioid
abuse
impacted
us
as
we
learned
more
about
it,
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
because
of
this,
our
group
wants
to
address
the
burden
of
drug
abuse
and
provide
new
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
therapeutic
targets
for
human
substance
abuse.
We’d
like
to
explore
the
effects
of
opioids
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(including
codeine,
fentanyl,
heroin,
hydrocodone,
methadone,
morphine,
and
oxycodone)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
see
how
gene
expression
differs
in
those
who
abuse
opioids.
We
do
this
by
identifying
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
specific
gene
expression
differences
between
the
control
group
and
opioid
abusers
on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
postmortem
ventral
midbrain.
To
do
so,
we
first
obtained
our
data
from
the
NCBI
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sequence
Read
Archive
​
[9]
under
the
accession
number:
PRJNA492904.
The
dataset
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
contains
29
of
opioid
abusers
and
20
of
control
(total
of
49
individuals).
After
obtaining
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dataset,
we
converted
the
format
of
the
data
from
an
SRA
dump
to
a
FASTQ
format,
which
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is
an
accessible
raw
sequencing
file
format
​
[3]​
.
With
this
FASTQ
format,
we
processed
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
data
using
FastQC
​
[4]
for
data
quality
control
.
Next,
we
applied
cutadapt
​
[5]
to
trim
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adapter
sequences
from
the
reads
.
After
the
RNA
sequences
were
trimmed,
we
used
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
kallisto
​
[6]
to
align
our
sequences
and
get
gene
expression
counts.
With
the
gene
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
expression
count,
we
filtered
the
data
for
quality
reads,
combined
the
gene
counts
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
together,
and
used
that
data
as
input
to
perform
DESeq2
​
[7]
analysis.
In
addition
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DESeq2,
we
utilized
other
methods
such
as
the

network
analysis
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(WGCNA)
​
[8]​
,
which

to
discover
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
modules of highly correlated genes related with opioid abuse ​
[1]​
.
 
Ideally,
we
want
to
present
genome-wide
changes
in
midbrain
gene
expression
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
associated
with
human
opioids
abuse.
This
way,
we
could
find
the
midbrain
gene
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
expression
difference
between
opioid
users
and
control
groups.
Also,
we
want
to
identify
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
drug-responsive
modules
associated
with
responses
with
opioids
abuse.
Hopefully,
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
opioid-regulated
genes
identified
in
this
project
might
provide
new
therapeutic
targets
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
implicate
important
biomarkers
for
human
substance
abuse
​
[1]​
.
The
project
output
will
be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a report/paper with the findings and figures we’ve made from our analysis.

Methods
 
Quality Control and Data Cleaning
 
Fast-qc
 
To
start
off,
we
ran
ten
of
our
raw
data
files
through
Fastqc​
[4]​
.
The
raw
data
is
made
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
base
pair
nucleotides
(ATCGU).
The
inputs
for
Fastqc
are
a
sample
of
the
data
that
we’d
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
like
to
get
measurements
of
and
an
output
path
to
direct
where
to
put
the
files
generated
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by
running
Fastqc.
The
html
file
visualizes
statistics
which
give
us
information
on
the
quality
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
our
reads.
Those
statistics
include
information
such
as
the
total
number
of
sequences
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
processed
and
the
length
of
the
shortest
and
longest
sequence
in
the
set.
Fastqc
also
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reports
information
on
the
per
base
sequence
quality,
per
sequence
quality
scores,
per
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
base
sequence
content,
per
base
GC
content,
per
sequence
GC
content,
per
base
N
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
content,
sequence
length
distribution,
sequence
duplication
levels,
and
overrepresented
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sequences.
We
used
the
generated
“summary.txt”
file
to
give
us
an
indication
of
the
overall
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
quality
of
the
sample
and
whether
or
not
we
should
keep
it
to
incorporate
into
analysis.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The
“summary.txt”
file
gives
a
general
‘pass’
or
‘fail’
for
each
file
which
lets
us
know
if
it
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
normal (meaning ‘random and diverse’).
 
 
Cutadapt
 
The
main
reason
for
running
Fastqc
on
our
samples
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
we
would
have
to
perform
adapter
trimming
on
our
data.
If
there
is
adapter
content,
then
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
we
would
remove
the
adapter
sequences
contained
in
the
data
with
a
library
such
as
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cutadapt​
[5]​
.
Adapter
sequences
tell
us
where
the
gene
is
about
to
start
and
points
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
where
it
would
start
transcription
of
that
gene.
Adapter
sequences
are
only
needed
within
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
cell
to
point
to
where
to
start
transcription
for
genes.
Therefore,
it
can
be
removed
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
since
it
does
not
tell
us
any
genetic
information
and
is
only
a
flag
for
where
the
sequencing
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
read from the sample starts.
 
 
Kallisto
 
Next
we
used
Kallisto​
[6]
to
perform
pseudo-alignment
on
our
samples.
Kallisto
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
aligns
the
reads
against
a
reference
transcriptome
and
counts
how
many
times
those
reads
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
appear,
giving
us
those
counts
for
each
gene.
The
input
for
Kallisto
includes
a
reference
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3
  
 
index,
the
number
of
bootstraps
we’d
like
to
perform
and
the
sample.
We
first
had
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
create
the
kallisto
index,
using
the
reference
transcriptome
GRCh38
​
[10]​
.
Once
the
index
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
built,
it
is
used
to
align
reads
(similar
to
using
a
reference
genome
to
compare
reads
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
against)
and
provide
gene
counts
for
all
our
samples.
We
decided
to
set
the
number
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bootstraps
to
the
default
one
hundred
as
is
standard
and
lastly,
we
used
the
--pseudobam
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
flag
to
get
bam
files
output
from
Kallisto
as
well
as
the
following.
When
running
all
the
data
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
through,
we
use
both
read
files
(the
.1
and
.2
files
since
it
is
paired-end
reads)
as
input
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
for
each
sample
we
get
an
output
directory
that
gives
us
three
files:
run_info.json,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
abundance.tsv,
and
abundance.h5.
The
run_info.json
file
gives
us
details
such
as
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
quantification,
number
of
bootstraps,
and
program
version.
The
abundance.tsv
gives
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
results
of
the
quantification
(gene
counts).
However,
the
main
output
file
of
importance
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
pseudoalignment.bam
file
which
gives
us
the
alignment
sequence
information.
The
h5
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
files
give
the
quantifications
with
the
bootstraps.
Once
we
finished
running
Kallisto
on
all
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the data and received all the output files, we performed some data cleaning and filtering.
 
Samtools
 
We
first
used
Samtools​
[15]
to
drop
PCR
duplicates
from
the
bam
files
output
from
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
kallisto,
so
that
amplified
gene
counts
wouldn’t
be
overrepresented
and
skew
our
results.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Next,
we
sorted
the
bam
files
based
on
gene
name
so
that
the
bam
files
would
be
ready
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be
used
in
the
HT-seq
step
of
our
analysis.
Lastly,
we
removed
multi-mapped
reads
with
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
value q=10.
 
GTF File Filtering and HT-Seq
 
HTSeq​
[14]
is
used
to
assemble
the
read
counts
of
the
genes.
HTSeq
requires
a
gene
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
annotation
file
and
the
aligned
bam
file.
We
used
the
Ensembl
gene-level
annotations
from
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gencode
release
24
(GRCh38.p5)​
[13]
as
the
annotation
file.
Before
continuing
with
HTSeq,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
we
filtered
the
annotation
GTF
file
for
only
""gene""
type,
and
also
removed
rows
that
were
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from
chromosome
M
(mitochondrial
DNA).
Lastly,
we
removed
genes
that
had
less
than
1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reads.
We
then
proceeded
with
acquiring
the
read
counts
per
gene
for
each
bam
file
using
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HTSeq
and
merged
all
the
files
together
at
the
end
to
create
a
holistic
gene
count
csv
to
be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
used in the next differential gene expression analysis.

Differential Gene Expression Analysis
 
DESeq2
 
DESeq2​
[7]
requires
a
gene
counts
matrix
of
all
the
samples,
the
SRA
run
table
which
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
links
the
samples
to
other
values
such
as
the
patients
age,
sex,
race,
brain
pH,
RIN,
cause
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
death,
whether
or
not
they
used
cocaine,
and
what
drugs
were
in
their
system
when
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
experimental
group
overdosed,
and
lastly
a
design
parameter
which
specifies
to
return
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fold
change
of
the
results
from
whether
or
not
the
subject
used
opioids.
We
made
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DESeqDataSet
object,
using
brainpH,
RIN,
and
age
as
covariates
and
then
filter
to
keep
only
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
counts
that
are
greater
than
10.
We
then
use
that
output
to
create
a
volcano
plot.
The
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
volcano
plot
shows
us
how
many
genes
are
up-regulated
and
down-regulated
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
comparison
to
the
control
which
can
give
us
an
idea
of
to
what
extent
the
expression
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
genes
differ
if
you
use
opioids.
We
also
conducted
principal
component
analysis
(PCA)
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
order
to
get
an
idea
of
how
much
the
experimental
group
varies
in
comparison
to
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
control as well. We use the same DESeqDataSet object to this as well.
 
WGCNA
 
Taking
advantage
of
the
R
WGCNA
​
[8]
package,
we
are
able
to
divide
the
genes
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
based
on
the
topological
overlap
matrix
dissimilarity.
Topological
overlapping
matrix
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dissimilarity
is
calculated
based
on
the
adjacency
matrix
between
the
genes.
It’s
an
n
by
n
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
matrix
signifying
the
weighted
correlation
between
the
genes.
Basically
this
matrix
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
measures
how
similar
different
genes
are
after
the
principal
component
analysis
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conducted
in
DESeq2.
Therefore,
in
each
color
module,
similar
genes
are
grouped
together
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
based
on
their
quantification
and
are
represented
by
different
colors
in
the
bottom
of
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
graph.
Using
this
clustering,
we
are
able
to
show
the
correlation
between
the
color
modules
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and the up- or down-regulation with opioid abuse.

Results
 
 
Exploratory Data Analysis
 
SRA Run Table
 
First
and
foremost,
we
did
an
exploratory
data
analysis
on
our
SRA
run
table
that
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
associated
with
the
samples,
so
that
we
can
get
to
know
the
general
trends
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
information
that
our
data
contains.
First
we
looked
at
the
differences
in
means
for
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
quantitative
values
in
our
data
for
the
experimental
group
versus
the
control.
In
doing
this,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
we
compared
the
values
for
age,
brain
pH,
and
RIN
by
using
a
box
plot.
We
also
looked
at
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
difference
in
means
for
just
the
experimental
group
to
see
if
cocaine
use
was
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
confounding
variable.
Below
in
Figure
1,
you
can
see
some
of
our
findings,
and

Raw Data
 
Next,
after
running
a
subset
of
our
data
through
Fast-qc,
and
evaluating
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pass/fail
values
we
received,
we
found
that
there
was
no
trace
of
adapter
content,
example
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
shown
in
Figure
2
below.
This
means
that
we
don’t
have
to
use
cutadapt
to
trim
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adapter sequences in the data in order to be ready for the alignment process with kallisto.

Kallisto Counts
 
Once
alignment
was
finished
and
we
merged
the
counts
that
kallisto
output
for
each
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sample,
into
one
csv,
we
performed
a
simple
eda
on
the
values
in
order
to
check
the
validity
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
our
data.
We
performed
a
t-test
on
the
data
for
the
experimental
group
versus
the
control
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
group,
then
calculated
the
log-fold
change.
We
also
wanted
to
see
the
relative
abundance
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
specific
types
of
genes
after
running
alignment
on
our
samples.
We
did
this
by
taking
the
first
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
two
letters
of
the
genes
name
representation
and

out
what
they

We
then
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
made the pie chart out of the counts of those values. (Figure 3)

Differential Gene Expression Analysis

We
created
a
volcano
plot,
using
Enhanced

​
[16]​
,
to
help
visualize
the
data
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from
DESeq-2.
The
volcano
plot
can
show
us
relatively
how
many
genes
are
either
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
upregulated
or
downregulated,
with
the
y-axis
telling
us
how
significant
those
differences
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
are
(negative

We
have
16
up-regulated
genes
and
28
down
regulated
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
genes. (Figure 4)

Next,
we
performed

in

to
see
the

between

The

explained
36%

and
the

explained
20%

the

From
this,
we
can
see
that
patients
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
who
abused

have
a
larger

to

Discussion
 
We
believe
that
there
may
have
been
some
preprocessing
steps
that
did
not
run
as
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
we
expected.
Our
lack
of
knowledge
in
this
particular
field
left
us
a
bit
unsure
of
what
else
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
we
could
possibly
do
to
better
clean
our
data
and
we
feel
that
this
may
have
skewed
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
results
of
our
analysis.
We
had
some
trouble
downsizing
our
data
after
getting
the
counts
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
HT-Seq,
even
after
filtering
for
only
“gene”
type
and
excluding
those
that
were
on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
chromosome M.
 
 
When
it
comes
to
the
dendrogram
result
of
WGCNA
we
believe
that
it
was
also
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
affected
by
the
variance
of
genes
we
decided
to
use
since
we
restricted
it
to
only
protein
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
coding
genes.
Without
that
variability,
we
believe
that
is
why
we
were
only
able
to
see
10
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
groups of genes output by WGCNA.
 
 
1 0
  
 
The
data
used
in
this
experiment
was
very
limited.
It
focused
on
all
males
and
had
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
no
female
representation.
Oftentimes
results
can
be
much
different
for
females
and
gene
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
expression
differences
may
appear
to
be
different.
Therefore,
we
should
consider
that
this
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
analysis
should
not
be
seen
as
widely
applicable
to
all
opioid
users.
Furthermore,
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients
that
the
samples
were
collected
from
were
predominantly
black,
making
up
72%
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
population.
Here
arises
another
issue
in
that
different
races
and
regions
around
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
world
can
respond
much
differently
than
others,
therefore,
perhaps
doing
race-specific
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
among
multiple
races
might
be
a
better
idea.
Another
future
problem
we
could
look
into
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
seeing
whether
or
not
age
makes
a
difference
in
gene
expression.
By
using
a
wider
range
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
age
in
patients,
we
could
analyze
whether
or
not
age
could
possibly
be
a
confounding
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
variable in gene expression.
 
Conclusion
 
In
our
study,
we
found
28
significantly
down-regulated
genes
and
16
significantly
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
up-regulated
genes.
We
also
identified
specific
gene
networks
which
grouped
genes
similar
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in
expression
together.
This
gave
us
insight
into
what
kinds
of
genes
are
most
affected
by
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
opioid
drug
abuse.
We
also
learned
that
people
who
use
opioids
have
greater
gene
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
expression
variability
than
those
who
do
not
use
them.
Finding
specific
genes
such
as
MME
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
SPDYE6
that
were
most
downregulated
and
upregulated,
can
help
us
think
about
new
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
genes to use as therapeutic targets to fight opioid addiction.

 ","In this study, the researchers conducted a differential gene expression analysis of human opioid abusers. They explored the effects of opioids on gene expression and identified specific gene expression differences between the control group and opioid abusers. The researchers used various tools and methods such as FastQC, cutadapt, kallisto, DESeq2, and WGCNA to process and analyze the data. They found 28 significantly down-regulated genes and 16 significantly up-regulated genes in opioid abusers compared to the control group. The results also showed that opioid users have greater gene expression variability. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying opioid addiction and potential therapeutic targets for substance abuse. However, there were limitations in the data used, such as limited sample size and lack of diversity in terms of gender and race. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore other factors that may influence gene expression in opioid abusers."

The Genetic Basis of Antibiotic Resistance in E. Coli
Introduction
One of the most dif ficult problems in drug development
today is the growing number of
bacterial strains that have developed resistance to
antibiotics. Due to their immunity to known
medicine, their exposure to humans can lead to infections
that are impossible to cure [1].
According to the
International Federation of Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers & Associations
(
IFPMA), by 2050, antimicrobial resistance could kill
up to ten million people per year [2]. The
biological mechanism behind antibiotic resistance
involves changes in bacteria at the genetic
level, through either random mutations in their own
DNA  or the acquisition of genetic material
from the environment [3]. Although antibiotic resistant
bacteria have been studied for decades,
their whole genome sequencing has started relatively
recently [4]. This study aims to investigate
the genetic factors associated with antibiotic resistance
by performing a genome-wide
association study on antibiotic resistant E. Coli
bacteria and comparing the results against non
antibiotic resistant E. Coli bacteria.
Enterobacteriaceae, specifically E. Coli, commonly
causes infections both in healthcare
settings and communities [5]. Certain strains however
have developed an especially dangerous
resistance mechanism, the ability to produce an enzyme
known as extended-spectrum
beta-lactamase, or ESBL  [5]. ESBL  is capable of breaking
down multiple types of antibiotics
such as penicillin, rendering them inef fective [5].
Data
The study is conducted using two groups of samples,
one with an ESBL-enzyme
producing strain of E.Coli which is antibiotic resistant,
and a non-antibiotic resistant control
group [6][7]. Sample sizes were 36 whole genomes for
each group
. Whole genome sequencing
data was obtained via an Illumina MiSeq sequencer
and formatted as two pair -end fastq files per
sample
[6][7]
. The FastQ files were first piped through
FastQC, a quality control program, withChen, Haider , Wu
2
default settings for an initial summary of read quality [8]. The generated report outputs
Pass/W arn/Fail flags for various categories (e.g.
Basic Statistics, Per Sequence GC Content, Per
Base Sequence, etc.) [9]. We chose to keep samples
that passed the Basic Statistics check and
compared overall quality between both groups. All
of our files passed this check, although there
were some dif ferences amongst groups that may af fect
variant calling accuracy further down the
line. The most significant dif ference between the
groups was the %GC content as shown in
Figure 2, with most of the ESBL  producing samples
having higher amounts on average
compared to the control group. This may either be
a physiological phenomenon or a confounding
factor that may need to be addressed.

single sample sorted by read length

Figure 2: Aggregated count of quality Pass/Fail flags between ESBL  and control samples.
Methodology
Figure 3 below provides an overview of our project
pipeline, starting with downloading
the raw reads and ending with our analysis from the
genome wide association study and variant
annotation using SnpEf f. Once the sequencing data
is downloaded and assessed for quality , it is
processed using multiple bioinformatics software tools,
starting with Cutadapt for adapter
trimming.
Figure 3: Project Pipeline Overview
During the sequencing process, temporary adapter sequences
of nucleotides are attached
to the fragments of DNA  in order to facilitate sequencing
[8]. Sometimes these adapters are
Chen, Haider , Wu
4
accidentally sequenced as part of the sample genome, so they need to be algorithmically
removed using tools such as Cutadapt [10]. Cutadapt
was run on all 72 samples using default
parameters, in trimmed pair -end reads mode to “remove
adapter sequences… from
high-throughput sequencing reads” [10]. The trimmed
fastq files were piped through FastQC
again to ensure that the data still passes our quality
check post-adapter trimming, which every
file did [8].
Once all files have been cleaned, the reads from each
sample can be aligned into a whole
genome sequence using a program called Bowtie2 [1 1].
Bowtie2 takes in a pair of fastq files
from a single sample and a known reference genome
to assemble the reads into a contiguous
sequence [1 1]. After performing alignment on each
sample, 36 .sam files are produced for each
group. These .sam files are converted into a readable
.bam format using samtools, a package for
manipulating .sam files. Once this is completed, the
72 .bam files are ready for variant calling
and analysis using GA TK [12].
GATK is a suite of tools used for the analysis of
genomic data [12]. For this study , the
HaplotypeCaller tool was used to identify Single Nucleotide
Polymorphisms (SNP’ s) between
each group and compare them [13]. The resulting output
after GA TK is an aggregated VCF file
containing the list of variants for all 72 E.Coli
genomes which we then used for a genome wide
association study using the software Plink, as well
as variant annotation using SnpEf f to identify
variants of significance and their functional ef fects.
Before proceeding with the genome wide association
study (GW AS), a basic principal
component analysis was conducted using Plink to determine
if there are potentially meaningful
differences between the two groups. The first two
principal components were calculated for each
sample and plotted in the scatterplot shown in Figure
4. It can be seen that the antibiotic-resistant
samples clustered together on the right of the graph,
indicated by the points in blue. The orange
points represent samples from the control group, which
appear to have much more variance. It is
unknown why the three outliers in the top left vary
so significantly from the rest of the control
group, but they were retained in the study due to
the sample populations being so small.
The genome wide association study was performed using
a logistic regression model to
identify the SNP’ s that are statistically significant
between the two groups. The model computes
a p-value for each SNP  indicating this level of significance.
The model was tuned using the first
two principal components as covariates and by filtering
out all SNPs with a genotyping rate ofChen, Haider , Wu
5
less than 60%. The genotyping rate is used as a measure of missing data, with 60% being chosen
as it was the best threshold to minimize the skew
of the distribution of p-values.
Figure 4: Principal Component Analysis Results
The variant annotation and filtration
was performed using snpEf f and snpSift. We used
the built-in E-coli database that snpEf f provided
as the reference genome during annotation. This
step gave us an annotated vcf file, a succinct summary
report, and a gene_name table. We could
then run snpSift on the VCF file to filter out the
common variants which are present in both
groups and leave only the variants that dif fer between
groups. Finally , We used the extractFields
command in snpSift to extract useful information from
these remaining variants for further
analysis.
Results
The snpEf f output consists of a comprehensive
summary report, an annotated vcf file and
a gene_name table. The summary report provides us
a brief overview of our variants. We have
encountered 341666 warnings in the control group and
514589 warnings in the esbl group.
Since
the
number of errors we encountered is relatively
small compared to our datasize, we decided to
focus more on the numerous warnings. These warnings
mainly consist of
ref_dose_not_match_genome error . We theorized that
it may be a result of using two dif ferent
reference genomes: the original reference genome and
the one provided by snpEf f. It was
Chen, Haider , Wu
6
unavoidable in this study as our initial reference genome was missing an essential .gf f file. Our
results could significantly improve if we built our
own database. Another observation is that the
variant rate of the esbl group is 1 variant every
16 bases, which is much higher than the control
group with 1 variant every 24 bases. We hypothesize
that it is due to the possibility that the
ESBL  group is more prone to mutations.
Besides the runtime information, the statistical
data generated by snpEf f illustrates that
the control and ESBL  group are incredibly similar
with a few variance. For both groups, the
Missense/Silent ratio is about 3 which is quite high.
As this ratio increases, the more mutations
happening in our samples directly af fect the amino
acid it produces. This could be the reason for
E. Coli bacteria gaining resistance to antibiotics.
The rest of the statistics are similar and do not
reveal how E. Coli bacterias become antibiotic resistant.
Next, we applied snpSift filtration to
reduce the scope of the dataset to observe any noticeable
changes.

In this step,
we passed the annotated
VCF file we got from snpf f to snpSift. We then
filtered them out and kept only high/moderate impact
variants present in all of our ESBL
samples and absent in at least one of our control
samples. Originally we had over 60,000 variants
after annotation, but with filtering we ended up with
50. We extracted their information and
counts for the ten most frequently presented Mutated
Genes, each one denoted by a specific gene
ID. Their gene IDs are listed below .
[HUS201 1_1899 ,   HUS201 1_1904, HUS201 1_1897,  HUS201 1_1898,

HUS201 1_1902,  HUS201 1_1903,  HUS201 1_1896,  HUS201 1_1905]
We can observe that in the remaining variants the
most frequent mutations are from A -> G (see
Base changes). In addition, the variants_impact_MODIFIER
is quite high indicating that there

are more variances, with greater impact, in this gene. There are also many variants identified to
have a missense variant ef fect, which usually resulting
in a dif ferent amino acid sequence.

The genome wide association study output is a table
of 32,414 SNPs, each row
containing the specific base, genome location, and
computed p-value. This table was filtered
using Python’ s pandas package in a Jupyter Notebook
to find the SNP’ s that had a p-value below
the significance threshold. For the study , we initially
set this threshold to 0.05. 1,598 SNPs were
identified with p-values less than this threshold.
However , because these comparisons are being
tested simultaneously , the likelihood of incorrectly
identifying a SNP  as statistically significant
increases. In order to compensate for this, Bonferroni
correction was applied, so the new
threshold was calculated by dividing the desired threshold
by the number of comparisons: 0.05 /
32,414 = 1.54e-6. After filtering using this corrected
threshold, it was found that 0 SNP’ s had
p-values that could indicate statistical significance.
The ten SNPs with the lowest p-values in the
study are shown in Figure 8.

The p-values from this table were then visualized
using a QQ-plot to check if their distribution
resembles data that is normally distributed. From
the plot shown in Figure 9, there appears to be
a skew of more extreme values, indicated by the longer
tails at the ends. A Manhattan plot was
also produced to visualize how these p-values vary
across the genome. In Figure 10, each dot
represents a single SNP , with the -log10 of the p-value

horizontal red line at the top of the plot.

Conclusion
Our study aimed to explore and identify the genetic
markers that characterize antibiotic
resistance in ESBL-producing E. Coli. The project
involved comprehensive processing of our
genomic data, followed by a genome wide association
study and analysis of found variants and
their functional ef fects. Through our analysis, we
noticed some observable dif ferences through
principal component analysis and variant annotation,
but the location of the specific SNPs
responsible for ESBL  production is still unknown.
One of the primary limitations encountered was determining
a definition for antibiotic
resistance that could be feasibly tested using a GW AS.
Although ESBL  production has been
proven to render E.Coli resistant to common antibiotics,
there are many dif ferent physiological
mechanisms that could also be used to classify other
bacterial strains as antibiotic resistant.
Another limitation was the limited sample size. This
paired with the possible outliers from our
principal component analysis could have given skewed
results. If the study were to be repeated it
would ideally involve hundreds, if not thousands of
E.Coli samples. Time was another limiting
factor , as a single sample takes approximately 60-70
minutes to be processed from raw reads to
the Variant Call Format file needed for Plink and
SnpEf f. We also did not have access to a .gf f
file at the beginning of the study , which is an annotation
file that is meant to be paired with the
reference sequence used for alignment and variant
calling. Because of this, we had to use two
different reference genomes at dif ferent stages of
the pipeline, which may have influenced the
final GW AS and SnpEf f outputs. In order to improve
the logistic regression model, covariates
such as %GC Content and more granular SNP  filtering
could be implemented.
This study is a small stepping stone toward addressing
the much broader problem of
antibiotic resistance. The project pipeline can be
applied to any strain of bacteria with a case and
control group which can not only help identify significant
genomic variants, but also their ef fects
on protein transcription. Understanding these markers
for antibiotic resistance can better inform
scientists of how such physiological changes occur
and what can be done to prevent the
emer gence of new antibiotic resistant strains in the
future.Chen, Haider , Wu

Original Project Proposal
One of the most dif ficult problems in drug development
today is the growing number of
bacterial strains that have developed resistance to
antibiotics. Because these bacteria cannot be
killed using known medications, their exposure to
humans can lead to infections that are virtually
impossible to cure [1]. The biological mechanism behind
antibiotic resistance involves changes
in bacteria at the genetic level, through either random
mutations in their own DNA  or the
acquisition of genetic material from the environment
[2]. Although antibiotic resistant bacteria
have been studied for decades, their whole genome
sequencing has started relatively recently .
This study aims to investigate the genetic factors
associated with antibiotic resistance, and use
these findings to develop a machine learning model
to predict whether a new bacterial strain has
the potential to be antibiotic resistant.
The data used in this study would include whole genome
sequencing data from multiple
strains of bacteria, particularly the strains classified
as threats by the CDC as of 2019 [3]. These
would be compared to the strains of their non-resistant
counterparts, as well as each other for
commonalities that might characterize antibiotic resistance.
We plan on using FastQC to check
the quality of the dataset and Cutadapt for adapter
trimming. Afterwards, we will pipe the
processed data into Bowtie2 for read alignment and
finally GA TK and Snpef f for gene
annotation and analysis. With this data we will engineer
features and test various machine
learning models. The project output would include
a report containing the results of the
investigation and the predictive model used to classify
a strain as antibiotic resistant.
The replication paper is similar to this study as
high throughput sequencing data is being
processed and analyzed, however there are multiple
major dif ferences. Bacteria is the or ganism
being studied, and DNA  is being studied rather than
RNA. This is because we are more
concerned with genetic variation through SNP’ s in
this case, rather than gene expression levels.
Alongside this, the results of the investigation will
guide the production of a machine learning
model, something that was not done in the replication
paper .Chen, Haider , Wu
14
We will be studying a family of bacteria known as
Enterobacteriaceae, specifically E.
Coli. This bacteria commonly causes infections both
in healthcare settings and communities.
Certain strains however have developed an especially
dangerous resistance mechanism, the
ability to produce an enzyme known as extended-spectrum
beta-lactamase, or ESBL. ESBL  is
capable of breaking down multiple types of antibiotics
such as penicillin, rendering them
ineffective. Our goal is to study approximately 90
E. Coli samples and identify the genes that are
responsible for the production of this enzyme. The
data was collected using whole genome
sequencing. There have been previous studies that
have identified genetic mutations in other
species of antibiotic resistant bacteria, however
we would like to utilize these results to produce
a
machine learning model that can be used for prediction
of future strains.

Abstract
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive neurodegenerative disorder that slowly
destroys a person's cognitive and physical abilities. The cause of AD is unclear, but is believed to
be a combination of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors. Because the only way to deﬁnitely
diagnose AD is post mortem, the search for earlier deﬁnitive detection is crucial. One way of doing
this is by analyzing blood samples to detect biomarkers and microRNAs. A biomarker is deﬁned as
a characteristic that is objectively measured as an indicator of normal biological processes, while
microRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNA molecules that are involved in the regulation of gene
expression. Recent studies show miRNAs and biomarkers as possible tools for AD diagnosis, thus,
leading us to analyze blood miRNA data for our study. Utilizing inﬂuences from various other
studies, we examined 67 blood samples of AD and control patients through our custom genetics
pipeline in hopes of a breakthrough in understanding the pathology of the disease. We then
implemented two diﬀerent statistical tests, a non-parametric hypothesis test (Wilcoxon-Mann-
Whitney Test) and a parametric hypothesis t-test (DESeq2). From these tests we were able to
isolate nine signiﬁcant miRNAs to perform further analysis on its relationship and eﬀect to AD.
Introduction
Background
Alzheimer’s Disease is an age-related neurodegenerative disease that currently aﬀects more than
5.5 million Americans and is considered the 6th leading cause of death in the United States[1]. It is
an irreversible disease that causes declines in both mental and physical abilities as a result of
rapidly declining brain function. The pathological features of Alzheimer’s associated with the loss in
proper brain function include amyloid plaques, neuroﬁbrillary tangles, chronic inﬂammation,
vascular contributions and the loss of neural connections and cell death[1]. As a result, Alzheimer’s
patients undergo symptoms that generally include confusion, diﬃculty speaking and severe
memory loss. The disease itself can be diagnosed at all age levels; however, it is generally more
common with individuals 65 years of age or older. At this time, current treatments can help manage
symptoms, but neither a cure nor a cause for the disease has been identiﬁed, despite the ongoing
research. What is clear, however, is that genetics, the environment, an individuals lifestyle, and age,
are factors for an Alzheimer’s diagnosis[1].3/11/2021 Alzheimers-Biomarker -Analysis - Jupyter Notebook
dsmlp-login.ucsd.edu:9340/notebooks/alzheimers_gene_analysis/notebooks/Alzheimers-Biomarker -Analysis.ipynb 2/27are factors for an Alzheimers diagnosis[1].
There are currently several biomarkers for AD that have been identiﬁed to help diagnose the
disease. With this project we make the attempt to isolate those same biomarkers, such as miRNA,
and describe in detail their impact in the biological processes of AD, within the constraints of the
data available for this project. In the end, we believe new information about the disease could be
discovered to aid in the development of new possible treatments and maybe even contribute in
identifying the exact causes of the disease. The intentions of the project are to supplement the
world's current understanding of the disease in order to help the millions that are currently aﬀected.
Biomarkers
According to the National Institutes of Health Biomarkers Deﬁnitions Working Group, a biomarker is
deﬁned as a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal
biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic
intervention[3]. They assist in understanding what is going on inside a living body and can help
doctors and researchers in diagnosing and monitoring diseases. Examples of biomarkers include
Pharmacodynamic or Response Biomarkers, which is a biomarker that shows whether or not an
individual has a biological response after exposure to medical or environmental agents, and
Prognostic Biomarkers, which are biomarkers that indicate the progression or recurrence of a
particular disease or condition[4].
For Alzheimer's Disease, measurements of the brain image scans, cerebrospinal ﬂuid and blood are
common biomarkers associated with the disease as well as other neurological diseases.
Cerebrospinal Fluid and blood are both involved with identifying proteins, such as beta-amyloid and
tau, that are found in the brain[5]. AD has serious implications to the brain and overall brain function
which is why biomarkers are a useful tool in the ﬁght against the disease as it allows medical
professionals to monitor brain changes of a patient that they themselves may not realize.
miRNA in Relation to Alzheimer's Disease
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNA molecules that are involved in the regulation of gene
expression[6]. How miRNA regulates gene expression is by binding to Messenger RNA (mRNA) and
preventing mRNA from producing proteins. It is believed they play a crucial role in being able to
control metabolic and cellular pathways[6]. The role of miRNA is important in the project, not only
because our data is composed of blood samples that contain miRNA information, but the ability of
miRNA to be considered its own biomarker as well. Speciﬁcally, circulating miRNAs can be used to
diﬀerentiate between AD and other neurological diseases[7]. Looking at miRNA as biomarkers
would allow researchers to not only take note of physical observations provided by brain images,
but observations on a gene expression level more so than just the proteins involved with AD, but
the biological processes that lead the creation of such proteins in the ﬁrst place.
Methods
The data utilized for this project is from SRA study SRP022043 [8]. This raw dataset includes 48
blood samples from Alzheimer’s Disease patients and 22 blood samples from control patients.
However, during our data cleaning processing we were only able to use 67 samples out of the
original 70 samples. The samples were collected using Next Generation Sequencing [9], then3/11/2021 Alzheimers-Biomarker -Analysis - Jupyter Notebook
dsmlp-login.ucsd.edu:9340/notebooks/alzheimers_gene_analysis/notebooks/Alzheimers-Biomarker -Analysis.ipynb 3/27converted to fastq ﬁles. The raw fastq ﬁles were single ended strands that contained base pair
nucleotide letter representation. In order to get the data, we utilized the wget function to obtain this
data and store it in our database. wget is a computer program that retrieves content from web
servers [10]
After getting all the data, we then ran all the data ﬁles through FastQC [11]. FastQC is a quality
control tool that has a few parameters for inputs, including specifying an output path to put the
generated ﬁles. Each time FastQC runs, there are two resulting ﬁles, an html ﬁle and a .zip ﬁle. The
html ﬁle had information regarding the basic statistics, per base sequence quality, per sequence
quality scores, per base sequence content, per base GC content, per sequence GC content, per
base N content, sequence length distribution, sequence duplication levels, and overrepresented
sequences. Within the .zip ﬁles, there contains a ﬁle called summary.txt that gave us a PASS or
FAIL for each raw data ﬁle. We then extracted this ﬂag and kept all ﬁles that had PASS in it. All 70 of
the raw data ﬁles contained PASS in the summary.txt.
Next, we ran the ﬁles through cutadapt [12], which helped clean up the reads to remove adapter
sequences. The parameters for cuptadapt included an output directory and an adapter sequence.
Cutadapt looks for the adapter sequence in the reads and removes it if it is found. We used the
standard Illumina adapter sequence of “AGATCGGAAGAGC"". The adapter sequence is only used
to tell a cell where to start transcription. So, it does not contain any generic information and is an
indicator for where a sequencing read starts. The output ﬁles that we got from cutadapt were
similar to the raw data ﬁles, except the adapter sequences were removed, making them “cleaned”
These ﬁles were then run through FastQC again to make sure that the quality of reads after
removing the adapter sequences were adequate. We utilized the same method as before, by
looking at the html ﬁle and also extracting the ﬂag from the summary.txt ﬁle of the .zip. We kept all
the ﬁles that had PASS in it. This time, we removed 3 samples that had FAIL on the ﬁrst line of the
summary.txt, leaving a total of 67 samples.
We then used kallisto to get the read counts for miRNAs. kallisto utilizes a pseudo-alignment
system that maintains a high accuracy compared to other similar softwares [13]. The parameters for
kallisto include a reference index, length, and standard deviation of fragment length. We decided to
use the ensembl non-coding RNA reference ﬁle (as suggested by kallisto), and set the length to 50
(stated within the paper), and standard deviation of 10 (we also tried 20, and 30). We ultimately
used 10 because the counts between the samples were negligible. When we ran the ﬁles through
kallisto, the output directory gave us: a run_info.json, abundance.tsv, and an abundance.h5 ﬁle. The
run_info.json gave us information regarding the quantiﬁcation, number of bootstraps, and program
version while the abundance.tsv ﬁle gave the results of the quantiﬁcation and the h5 ﬁles gave us
the quantiﬁcation along with the bootstraps.
After running kallisto, we extracted the quantiﬁcation counts from each tsv ﬁle by using pandas [14]
to read all the kallisto tsv ﬁles and create a dataframe that allowed us to merge them together. We
then created a large csv ﬁle with all the non-coding RNA information for every read. Since our
project was exclusively focusing on looking at miRNA, we utilized the ensembl [15] fasta ﬁle that
was used to get the index ﬁle and ﬁltered that to get a list of all the miRNAs. Once we got a list of
all the miRNAs, we then ﬁltered our dataframe to only include the miRNAs to get just the relevant
information. We were then left with around 1900 miRNAs.3/11/2021 Alzheimers-Biomarker -Analysis - Jupyter Notebook
dsmlp-login.ucsd.edu:9340/notebooks/alzheimers_gene_analysis/notebooks/Alzheimers-Biomarker -Analysis.ipynb 4/27Next, we used DESeq2, which performs diﬀerential gene expression analysis based on the negative
binomial distribution[16]. DESeq2 requires a count matrix (we used the csv ﬁle created from
kallisto), a reference ﬁle containing sample information (this was given with the data that we used),
and a design parameter that speciﬁes the fold change from a speciﬁc parameter. In this case, our
parameter was GROUP, which separated the patients (alzheimer’s disease and control). We then
controlled for counts that were greater than 10 since miRNAs with counts less than that generally
have a larger variance and skew the results. We then ran DESeq2 with the default settings to
quantify the diﬀerential expression.
Alongside DESeq2, we also performed a Wilcoxon Test (as it was the original test performed in the
paper). This was a non-parametric test that involved summation of ranks[17]. We ran a for loop that
went through each row of the kallisto csv and used the wilcox.test() function within R. The
parameters for that included an X and Y, in this situation, X were the counts of Alzheimer's patients
while Y was the counts of the control patients. We also got the log2fold change of each miRNA by
getting the log2 of the mean of the Alzheimer's patients counts over the mean of the control
patients counts.

better understanding of what we were working with. We looked for trends and inconsistencies that
may have occurred, and also any correlation between the variables (mainly focusing on age, group
(Alzheimer’s patients vs. control patients), and gender. Furthermore, we did an analysis on each of
our FastQC results and the kallisto counts alongside the DESeq2 values to get a better
understanding of the data.
The Ages of our AD patients tended to be higher compared to controls, with an average age of 70
years old, while the average age of controls was 67 years old. [Figure 2]. There were also more
females in the study in both groups [Figure 3], however the average age of the females was 63 and
the average age of males was 71.

All of the reads that we processed had a passing quality score (In Green) [Figure 4] on the ﬁrst
round of FastQC. Furthermore, we also noticed that there were high number of adapter counts
when we did not remove the adapter sequence within the reads [Figure 5]. This is expected since
we didn't run Cutadapt to remove the adapter sequences.Out[43]:

When looking at the DESeq2 outputs, there was a large negative correlation between the
baseMean and lfcSE and a lesser negative correlation between the pvalue and the log2FoldChange
[Figure 6]. The log2FoldChange is the ratio of diﬀerences between the observed value over the
control value. The pvalue is the probablility of obtaining a result as extreme as the observed. A3/11/2021 Alzheimers-Biomarker -Analysis - Jupyter Notebook

test. The baseMean is the mean of normalized counts of all samples in the distribution. The lfcSE is
the standard error that is from the log2FoldChange column.

Figure 6. Correlation plot of DESeq2 output.
Our DESeq2 Results showed that for all of our samples we had no signiﬁcant miRNA’s, all had
p_values > 0.05 [Figure 4]. However, we noticed that around 1870 of the miRNA had a p_value of
exactly 1.0 so, we ﬁltered for p_values that were less than 1 and found 56 miRNA’s. In the original
study, they noted that there were 56 diﬀerent miRNA that they got as signiﬁcant; the exact same
number as our DESeq2 p_values that did not equal exactly 1. Still, we considered our DESeq2
results as inconclusive. Continuing along our pipeline, we performed a Wilcoxon Test. Our Wilcoxon
Test results showed that there were actually 63 signiﬁcant values with a p_value < 0.05 [Figure 5].
Looking at signiﬁcant values from Wilcoxon Test and the insigniﬁcant values from DESeq2, we
noticed that there was an overlap between the two, meaning that our results from DESeq2 were
“correct” just not fully the same as the original research paper. From our results, we narrowed it
down to the 11 most signiﬁcant values that were seen in our DESeq2 output, our Wilcoxon output,

We took our most upregulated and downregulated miRNA results from DESeq2 which were: hsa-
miR-766 (ENST00000390223.3), and hsa-miR-1248 (ENST00000629190.1) respectively [Figure 10].
We took our most upregulated and downregulated miRNA values from the Wilcoxon Test which
were: hsa-miR-6882 (ENST00000619233.1) and hsa-miR-26b (ENST00000362251.4), respectively
[Figure 11]. Showing the counts is important for comparing to controls, since each miRNA has (or
does not have) a value in both AD and controls. Analyzing the counts could give us an insight into
how these miRNA are at play when in AD patients or controls. From the boxplots, we can see that
there were a lot of counts of zero between all four of the miRNAs. Almost all of the miRNAs have an
interquartile range of 0, showing how many sample values were 0.Out[46]:

hsa-miR-1248 are 11x as much compared to Control [Figure 12]! Also, there are no counts of hsa-Out[48]:

Discussion
As seen on Figure 7, the control counts are nearly 4 times as large as the AD counts. This miRNA is
known for gene silencing and a lack of that gene silencing could be a factor within AD. For ﬁgure 8,
counts in AD are more than 10 times as much, leading us to conclude that it is possible that the
lack of activation of mRNA upon binding of cap-binding complexes could be another factor. In
Figure 9, there were no counts of miRNA 6882 in Alzheimer Disease, while there are counts in theOut[2]:

dsmlp-login.ucsd.edu:9340/notebooks/alzheimers_gene_analysis/notebooks/Alzheimers-Biomarker -Analysis.ipynb 15/27control. Nonexistent counts in this miRNA leads us to believe that patients are more likely to be
diagnosed with AD. In Figure 10 we determined inconclusive ﬁndings when looking at the counts
distribution for miRNA 26B!
Within our analysis, we were able to ﬁnd 11 miRNA values that overlapped between the two tests
we performed on our data. We went ahead and researched each miRNA value to obtain additional
information about them and whether they had any direct association to AD. Some common
processes seen through each miRNA value include gene silencing and regulation processes that
involved apoptosis. miRNA 6882 was the only miRNA value that was not able to ﬁnd suﬃcient
information to draw any conclusions relating to the miRNA or to the other 11 values.
What was common among the miRNA values we obtained were associations to various forms of
cancer, such as carcinoma. miRNA 21 in particular, is responsible for numerous biological
processes and diseases from cancer to cardiovascular diseases[21]. Additional insight into the
expression of miRNA 21 found it to be upregulated in almost all types of cancer some of which
include breast cancer, colon cancer, and lung cancer. miRNA 182 and miRNA 766 are some of the
other miRNA values that have some connection to cancer development that are included in the 11
miRNA values we isolated in our results.
Using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website, we were able to focus on
our second miRNA value of interest, miRNA 26B. According to the report on miRNA 26B on the
NCBI website, processes associated with this particular miRNA include negative regulation, or a
blocked expression, of a defense response to a virus as well as the positive regulation, or gene
undergoing transcription, of apoptotic signaling pathways[18]. Apoptotic signaling is a process that
is programmed for cell death[30]. miRNA 26B is interesting in particular for our project because it is
also associated with the positive regulation of tau-protein kinase activity. Tau is a common protein
associated with AD through neuroﬁbrillary tangles, which are collections of the tau protein[18].
These collections, commonly found in the neurons, block the transport system of a neuron which
damages neuron communication. Neuroﬁbrillary tangles, through tau proteins, and the buildup of
amyloid plaques, which consists of the toxic protein beta-amyloid 42, are just some of the main
characteristics of AD[2].
Even though a lot of the miRNAs may not be directly related to AD, we believe an indirect inﬂuence
on gene expression could still exist. For example, miRNA 142, one of the 11 values we further
investigated, had functions that have been linked to severe brain injuries prediction in patients[19].
It could be possible to utilize this miRNA to detect changes within AD patient brains. Or, miRNA
182 is positively related to apoptosis. It could be that there could be an overexpression of this
miRNA in AD patients[20].
Furthermore, we realized that the paper utilized a diﬀerent diﬀerential expression method compared
to what we wanted to use. We wanted to use DESeq2 as we have previously used it before, and
also factors in the entire dataset that is given. The original paper used a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney
test, a non parametric model that only looked at a speciﬁc miRNA. We felt that using DESeq2 is
advantageous as it considers all the diﬀerent miRNAs and does not just look at an individual
miRNA. This takes into consideration all of the data, which provides a more accurate result.
Part of the limitations concerning this project include the availability of suﬃcient data. While the
research paper that inﬂuenced our project provided us publicly with the 70 patient sample data, it
was mentioned that additional data was utilized that’s not publically available. This prevented us
from being able to properly compare our results during various stages of the project due this3/11/2021 Alzheimers-Biomarker -Analysis - Jupyter Notebook
dsmlp-login.ucsd.edu:9340/notebooks/alzheimers_gene_analysis/notebooks/Alzheimers-Biomarker -Analysis.ipynb 16/27diﬀerence. For example, if we had used the additional data, we may have been able to reproduce
the signiﬁcant results by solely running DESeq2. How this aﬀected our overall outcome can be
seen when we were only able to collect 11 miRNA values that overlapped out of a sample of over
1000 miRNA values. There was also a mention of several cognition tests, including Alzheimer
Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR),
Wechsler Memory Scale, and Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE). None of the results of any of these
tests were publicly available for us, which could have inhibited our results and ﬁndings. We could
not have utilized these mental tests to further our results or used them as additional factors within
our analysis.
Overall, we realize how complex AD is and the need for more research to be done in order to ﬁnd a
cure or deﬁnitive detection of this disease. miRNAs and other biomarkers can be a place to start,
but there are also so many other factors that can contribute to and need to be examined more.
However, we hope that the research and ﬁndings that we have done could be a starting point for
future research, especially if it involves utilizing blood based samples similar to our study.
Considering the promising outlook for using blood based data in the ﬁght against AD, we hope that
there could be more studies done on miRNAs and its functions, leading to more possible
relationships/correlations between that and AD. If we were to do further investigation, we would like
to have more information on the cognitive tests previously mentioned and how they could
supplement the data further. Obtaining a much larger data sample size would also be something we
would want to do. But, we hope that our current ﬁndings could help contribute to existing research
on AD pathways or may lead to the beginning of novel research on this disease.

Additional Discussion
Additional miRNA Information
Our ﬁrst overlapped miRNA value is miRNA 21 (hsa-mir-21, MIR21). It plays a crucial role in many
biological functions and diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. MIR21 also regulates
various immunological and developmental processes[21].
miRNA 451B or MIR451B is located on the chromosome 17q11.2. Similar to MIR21, MIR451B is
commonly associated with human cancers but is also responsible as a gene silencer which refers
to the downregulation of gene expression by miRNAs[22].
miRNA 142 or MIR142, has a gene ontology that associates this particular miRNAs roles to gene
silencing, negative regulation of inﬂammatory responses, positive regulation of neuroinﬂammatory
responses, and even responses to tumor necrosis factors[23]. Variations of MIR142 have also been
linked to predicting severe brain injury (SBI) in patients.
miRNA 26B or MIR26B, attributed to processes that include gene silencing by an miRNA, negative
regulation of defense response to viruses, positive regulation of apoptotic signaling pathways
(apoptotic refers to cell death), as well as positive regulation of tau-protein kinase activity[18]. Tau-
protein kinase activity is a feature of AD progression for those aﬀected by the disease
miRNA 182 or MIR182, is similar to MIR26B in that it also has a positive regulation response to
apoptotic processes. Additional roles include gene silencing, negative regulation of epithelial cell
apoptotic processes and positive regulation of gene expression[20]. It has a chromosome location
at 7q32.2 that is most commonly associated with the most common type of cancer, carcinoma.
miRNA let-7a-3 (MIR let-7a-3), miRNA let-7b (MIR let-7B), and miRNA let-7f-1 (MIR let-7f-1) are
part of the MIRLet7 family[24]. MIR let-7a-3 and MIR let-7b both share the chromosome location
22q13.31 while MIR let-7f-1 is located at 9q22.32. MIR let-7b has processes such as negative
regulation of hydrogen peroxide-mediated programmed cell death, and positive regulation of
angiogenesis[25]. MIR let-7f-1 is associated with negative regulation of apoptotic processes and
the negative regulation of protein kinase protein B[26]. All three are associated with gene silencing
properties.
miRNA 766 (MIR766) has pathways such as gene silencing and cellular response to tumor necrosis
factor[28]. Research indicates MIR766 is closely related to other cancer related miRNAs.
miRNA 1248 (MIR1248) has pathways such as viral mRNA translation and the transportation of the
SLBP independent mature mRNA[29]. It is believed that RNA processing is also a standard
processes completed by MIR1248.
Project Decisions
Our project focus shifted from looking at gene expression data for Alzheimer's Disease
patients, to observing blood sample data of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease and a
control group. This was done in large part because of the lack of access to the databases we
initially wanted to retrieve data from3/11/2021 Alzheimers-Biomarker -Analysis - Jupyter Notebook
dsmlp-login.ucsd.edu:9340/notebooks/alzheimers_gene_analysis/notebooks/Alzheimers-Biomarker -Analysis.ipynb 24/27After spending time searching for a viable replacement dataset on Recount2, we set on data
from SRA Study SRP022043 and downloaded the data onto DSMLP from the SRA Run
Selector Tool
We initially implemented the dockerﬁle for this project based on the dockerﬁle used in last
quarters replication and had hoped to implement TrimGalore as a new tool into our pipeline.
Incompatibility issues, however, led us to drop TrimGalore as tool and stick with running
Cutadapt and FastQC separately.
The Kallisto reference ﬁle was originally stored in our data ﬁle in our Github but the 
.gitignore  was hiding that ﬁle when we would pull the repo. We need it in order to run
Kallisto so we moved it to our teams directory on DSMLP.

Project Proposal (revised since initial submission):
For this project, our group intends to further contribute to the current research being conducted
about Alzheimer’s disease, its pathology and eﬀect it has on those that are currently diagnosed with
the disease. Alzheimer’s is an age-related neurodegenerative disease that currently aﬀects more
than 5.5 million Americans and is considered the 6th leading cause of death in the United States[1].
It is an irreversible disease that causes those diagnosed to experience declines in both their mental
and physical abilities as a result of abnormally rapidly declining brain function. The features of
Alzheimer’s associated with the loss in proper brain function include amyloid plaques, neuroﬁbrillary
tangles, chronic inﬂammation, vascular contributions and the loss of neural connections and cell
death[1]. As a result, Alzheimer’s patients undergo symptoms that generally include confusion,3/11/2021 Alzheimers-Biomarker -Analysis - Jupyter Notebook
dsmlp-login.ucsd.edu:9340/notebooks/alzheimers_gene_analysis/notebooks/Alzheimers-Biomarker -Analysis.ipynb 26/27diﬃculty speaking and severe memory loss. The disease itself can be diagnosed at all age levels,
however is generally more common with individuals 65 years of age or older. At this time, current
treatments can help manage symptoms, but a cure nor a cause for the disease has yet to be
identiﬁed, despite the ongoing research. What is clear, however, is that genetics, the environment,
an individuals lifestyle, and age, are factors for an Alzheimer’s diagnosis.
Rather than observing gene expression data similar to our replication project from the previous
quarter, this project focused on biomarkers commonly associated with Alzheimer's Disease and
other related diseases. According to the National Institutes of Health Biomarkers Deﬁnitions
Working Group, a biomarker is deﬁned as a characteristic that is objectively measured and
evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic
responses to a therapeutic intervention[6]. Observing such biomarkers assist in understanding what
is going on inside a living body and can help doctors and researchers in diagnosing diseases as
well as monitor how a persons conditions change over time.
We set out to elucidate the biomarkers that exist for Alzheimer's Disease, by observing blood
miRNA samples from a patient diagnosed with Alzheimer's and a separate control group. By doing
so, we believe new information about the disease could be discovered to aid in the development of
new possible treatments and maybe even contribute in identifying the exact causes of the disease.
The intentions of the project are to supplement the world's current understanding of the disease in
order to help the millions that are currently aﬀected.
Similar approaches will be used in this project as seen and conducted from our previous replication
project from the previous quarter. Tools such as FastQC will play an important role in ensuring that
the data being used to conduct this research is at a standard that allows unbiased analysis to be
performed. This is similar to how we used it to ensure quality patient samples of those with a
disorder (Major Depressive Disorder, Schizophrenia, and Bipolar Disorder) and the control group
from the replication paper. DESeq2 will be a primary tool in being able to conduct diﬀerential
analysis between what would be our control group and samples with patients diagnosed with
Alzheimer’s. We are able to use much of the same project pipelines we have already created for this
new project, with room for modiﬁcations, if necessary. By having the pipeline already built, we are
able to divert more time away from building the pipeline to other areas of the project such as
testing additional test samples, interpreting our ﬁndings, and additional exploratory data analysis
(EDA).
How this project diﬀers from our replication project begins with the focus of this new project being
on one disease rather than three. Focusing on one disease eliminates some of the complexities
involved in having to maintain three separate disorders within the project pipeline steps. Where our
samples come from will be speciﬁed once a ﬁnal dataset has been decided and it will be mentioned
in our eventual report for the project.
Project Output At the conclusion of this project, we will output our results in a report styled similarly
to our replication project. The report will include our ﬁndings such as biomarkers associated with
Alzheimer's Disease that have already been discovered and potentially new information regarding
those biomarkers.

The data used in the project consisted of 67 blood samples from AD patients and control patients. The analysis identified nine significant miRNAs that showed a potential relationship with AD. These miRNAs were further analyzed to understand their impact on the disease.

The results of the analysis showed that there were significant differences in the expression of certain miRNAs between AD patients and control patients. However, it should be noted that the results were inconclusive and did not fully align with the findings of the original research paper.

The limitations of the project included a smaller sample size, lack of access to additional data used in the original research paper, and limited availability of cognitive test results. Despite these limitations, the project provided valuable insights into potential biomarkers for AD and highlighted the need for further research in this area.

Overall, this project contributes to the existing research on AD biomarkers and provides a starting point for future studies on miRNAs and their relationship with AD."

Comparison of Dif ferential Gene Expression Analysis
Tools
Abstract
RNA-Seq (named as an abbreviation of ""RNA  sequencing"")
is a technology-based
sequencing technique that uses next-generation sequencing
(NGS) to reveal the presence and
quantity of RNA  in a biological sample at a given
moment, analyzing the continuously changing
cellular transcriptome. Dif ferential expression analysis
(DEA) takes the normalized read count
data (number of sequence reads originated from a particular
gene) and performs statistical
analysis to discover quantitative changes in expression
levels between experimental groups. As
technologies keep progressing and improving, there
are now multiple tools that can be used to
carry out dif ferential expression analysis. The purpose
of our project is to take a closer look at
some of these tools and compare their performance
to understand which tools are optimal for
DEA  in dif ferent situations. Specifically , the software
that we are going to focus on are:
ABSSeq
1
, voom.limma
2
, PoissonSeq
3
, DESeq2
4
, NOISeq
5
,
ttest
6
, and edgeR
7
. We will compare
their performances by looking at parameters such as
Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), False
Discovery Rate (FDR), Type I error rate, Sensitivity ,
and Specificity . In this project, we
discovered that DESeq2 & edgeR performed similarly
and were the overall best tools in most
metrics and datasets. However , there were some circumstances
in which other tools had
advantages. When there were outliers with unusually
high counts, both voom.limma & ttest
performed significantly better , while ABSSeq showed
benefits in controlling Type I errors when
the number of truly dif ferentially expressed genes
was low . Overall, there was no single tool
applicable in every situation. We could only identify
each tool's strengths and weaknesses and
showed circumstances where some tools were better
over others.
Background
In genetic research, the understanding of transcriptomes
– the set of all RNA  transcripts –
is crucial for researchers to gain insight into the
development of diseases, conditions, or disorderswith known genetic etiologies. The goal of the transcriptomic research is to catalog all transcript
species, including mRNAs, non-coding RNAs & small
RNAs, and, more importantly , to quantify
each transcript's changing expression levels during
development and under various
environmental and disease conditions. Identifying
genes that are dif ferentially expressed helps
determine which biological mechanisms could af fect
a disease or disorder . In the past,
researchers primarily used hybridization approaches,
such as microarrays, to deduce and quantify
these transcriptomes
9
. Hybridization involves incubating
labeled cDNA  to microarrays. While
being relatively high throughput and inexpensive,
it also has limitations such as reliance upon
existing knowledge about genome sequence and limited
dynamic range of detection
9
.
Traditionally , researchers utilized microarrays to
analyze genes. However , RNA-Sequencing has
recently grown in popularity . It provides much more
precise measurements and has the potential
to cover a broader range of transcripts that haven't
been correlated to an existing genome.
Compared with microarrays, RNA-Sequencing also has
an extremely low background signal and
all at a lower cost.
With the emer gence of RNA-sequencing data, countless
software have been developed to
extract information from such data. To process the
RNA-sequencing data, a researcher needs to
first quality check the reads produced by RNA-seq.
For some instances, it is necessary to clean
the RNA-seq reads from contamination from adapters
during preprocessing. Next, the cleaned
reads need to be aligned, mapping each read to a genome.
Finally , the researcher analyzes the
differentially expressed genes among all the samples
between experimental conditions. For each
step of this process, there are corresponding tools
that can be used to help the researchers. In
every genetic study using RNA-seq data, researchers
must determine which tools to use and how
to use them precisely . There is no single standardized
pipeline for dif ferential expression due to
the diversity in types of RNA  data. Here, we hope
to investigate how dif ferent software perform
on distinct synthetic datasets. Because DEA  is the
most crucial part of the pipeline for
RNA-sequencing, we want to focus the core of this
project on comparing gene dif ferential
expression tools. Overall, we are investigating the
following tools:  ABSSeq
1
, voom.limma
2
,
PoissonSeq
3
, DESeq2
4
, NOISeq
5
, ttest
6
, and edgeR
7
.
We are evaluating their performance on
Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), False Discovery Rate
(FDR), Type I error rate, Sensitivity ,
and Specificity . This project's importance is to possibly
help future researchers by providingthem information about which tools they could utilize for their RNA-seq research for the best
results based on the composition of the data and which
accuracy metrics needed to be controlled.
Dataset
Since dif ferentially expressed (DE) genes are determined
only within a degree of
certainty in a real-life RNA-seq dataset, we decided
to test the tools using simulated
post-alignment datasets. By doing so, we can control
variables such as the proportion of genes
differentially expressed, the number of up and down-regulated
genes, the number of outliers, and
the number of samples per condition. For a synthetic
dataset, we can know with complete
certainty which genes are truly dif ferentially expressed.
Therefore, we can calculate accuracy
metrics outputted by the tools against the actual
metrics. This feat would have been impossible to
accomplish in an actual experiment. We chose to create
several datasets with various
combinations of dif ferentially expressed genes and
samples per condition to capture the dif ferent
types of real-life genetic data (T able 1). Thus, we
can observe if specific tools performed better
when there were more or fewer dif ferentially expressed
genes.

In each simulated study, there are different numbers

differentially expressed genes between the 2 conditions
which will be explained more thoroughly below.
In all simulated studies, there are 12,500 total genes
and 2, 5, & 10 samples between 2
conditions, denoted by S

2
. The simulated studies

compared to the first condition (S

). The baseline,
single outlier , and random outlier have counts
generated from the Negative Binomial distribution,
whereas Poisson is generated from the
Poisson distribution. The ‘single’  outlier fraction
is the fraction of genes in a selected single
sample where the corresponding count is multiplied
with a factor between 5 and 10 — ‘random’
outlier fraction is similar but with a randomly selected
sample. Real-life data are usually very
messy and often prove to be more challenging than
plain synthetic datasets. Hence, we decided
to add conditions such as the Poisson distribution,
single and random fractions in order to
emulate real-life data’ s unpredictability and test
each tool against dif ferent circumstances.
Methods
Creating the Synthetic Data
We used compcodeR

to investigate the dif ferent
tools by first creating the synthetic data

specified the parameters:

(fraction of single outlier has unusually high counts)
and
`single.outlier .low.prob`

(fraction of single outlier has unusually low counts).
As for the random outlier fraction datasets,
we specified
`random.outlier .high.pr ob`
= 0.025 (fraction
of random outliers with unusually high
counts) and
`random.outlier .low.prob`
= 0.025 (fraction
of random outliers with unusually low
counts). For each dataset, we generated 10 dif ferent
versions since each are randomly generated
from dif ferent distributions in order to capture the
variance in performance of each tool.
Performing DEA
For performing tools supported by compcodeR, we used
the built-in function called
`runDiffExp`
where we specify the
`result.extent`
parameter as: DESeq2, edgeR, NOISeq,
voom.limma, or ttest. ABSSeq and PoissonSeq, which
are not as commonly used, were not
supported by compcodeR and needed to be run separately .
For both tools, the count matrix was
extracted from the compcodeR object for each dataset
and labeled to distinguish between
conditions based on the number of samples per condition.
Both were then run using default
parameters, and genes were labeled 1 or 0 based on
a cutof f value of 0.05 for adjusted p-value.

Table 2
The table above shows the normalization methods
of the 7 tools that we are exploring with an explanation
to
how the tools perform differential gene expressions
analysis in our project.Creating the metrics for comparison
After running dif ferential analysis using each tool
on every dataset, we found dif ferent
results depending on each specific tool’ s output (e.g.,
ABSSeq’ s output included variance and
fold change among others for each gene). To simplify
the results, we chose to use the adjusted
p-value with a cutof f value of 0.05 to predict DE
genes. The compcodeR data objects also
included labels for the true DE genes, which we appended
to the results in order to calculate
statistical metrics for comparison and analysis. Using
these labels and predictions, we were able
to calculate the overall accuracy (percentage of genes
correctly classified) of each tool on each
dataset and more complex statistics such as AUC, FDR,
specificity , and sensitivity . We chose
only to calculate Type I Error Rate (False Positive
Rate) on the datasets with zero dif ferentially
expressed genes.
Once we calculated each metric on each dataset, we
combined the results into two
matrices, separating the datasets with zero dif ferentially
expressed genes (
,
,
,
and
) into𝐵 00 𝑃 00 𝑆 00 𝑅 00
their own matrices due to them having dif ferent statistics.
Using these matrices, we made
boxplots for each dataset and statistic combination
(i.e. AUC and
),  grouping samples per𝐵 6 2 56 2 5
condition in the x-axis and tool by color , and aggregating
together the dataset version.
Performing DEA on Real Life Data
In addition to analyzing the synthetic datasets'
results, we also analyzed a real-life dataset
from the last quarter . This dataset analyzed RNA  sequencing
on brain tissues of dif ferent brain
regions to find similarities in molecular changes
that might exist in three psychiatric disorders.
The dataset extracted genes from post-mortem brains
of patients who suf fered Schizophrenia
(SZ),  Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and Bipolar
Disorder (BPD). In order to compare the
genes of each disease to a healthy brain's genes,
the dataset also extracted genes from a control
group, where patients did not suf fer any psychiatric
disorder .
In this project, we utilized the count matrix post-cleaning
and alignment obtained from
last quarter to perform dif ferential gene expression
analysis with each tool mentioned in this
report. To do so, we first preprocessed the dataset
by pairing each psychiatric disorders' genes
with the control's genes. Hence, we ended up with
three pairs of datasets: SZ-Control,
MDD-Control, and BPD-Control. We then used annotations
of age at death and brain pH topredict whether each gene was dif ferentially expressed or not using each individual tool. Like we
did with synthetic datasets, genes were labeled 1
or 0 based on a cutof f value of 0.05 for each
tool's adjusted p-value.
Results
Exploratory Analysis of the Tools
Timing of the Tools
Figure 1
The figure above shows the duration for
each tool on each individual synthetic dataset with
2 samples per
condition.
Figure 2
The figure above shows the duration for each
tool on each individual synthetic dataset with 5
samples per
condition.
Figure 3
The figure above shows the duration for each
tool on each individual synthetic dataset with 10
samples per
condition.
Based on the three graphs, it is portrayed that as
the number of samples per condition
increases from 2, 5, and 10, the duration of the tools
also increases in all synthetic datasets. This
is reasonable as it requires more time for tools to
perform their analysis when there are more
samples per condition and thus more overall data.
More specifically , DESeq2 and NOISeq
require the most time to perform their analyses which
could be explained by the process of how
they execute their dif ferential gene expression analysis
compared to the other tools. DESeq2
performs an internal normalization for each gene across
all samples using a geometric mean and
then is divided by the mean. In addition, DESeq2 uses
shrinkage estimation for dispersions &
fold changes, so a dispersion value is estimated for
each gene which could contribute to why it
takes a long period of time
15
. Similarly , NOISeq creates
a noise distribution of count changes by
comparing the number of reads per gene in all samples
with all the same conditions. It then uses
the distribution to assess whether the change in count
number is most likely a noise or truly DE
gene
16
.  Hence, it takes a longer duration to complete
than other tools in which they use standard
normalization methods (i.e., Trimmed Mean of M-values)
or don’ t use a noise distribution to
predict whether a gene is DE or not. Additionally ,
for both tools, they filter low-counts from their
DEA, which could also contribute to why they take
longer to perform than the other tools that
don’t filter out low-counts during normalization.
Overall Trends
Figures 4a and 4b
The figures above shows boxplots
of the values of AUC on
and
respectively. In𝐵 2 0 0 02 0 0 0 𝐵 04 0 0 0
both, AUC rises significantly when samples per condition
rises but the values in Figure 4a are both greater
and less
variable than in Figure 4b though the number of total
genes differentially expressed are the same.
Across all datasets and tools, several trends seemed
to be universal. For one, in almost
every single graph outside of specific statistics
on
, performance increased significantly𝐵 04 0 0 0
with the increase in samples per condition.  In Figure
4a, we see a clear dif ference in every tool’ s
average values (except ABSSeq) with around a 30% increase
in AUC between 2 samples per
condition and 10 in the rest of the tools. This increase
is seen in the greatest magnitude when
looking at sensitivity , which indicates that increasing
the samples per condition increases a tool's
ability to correctly classify truly DE genes. In general,
these results are primarily intuitive as
more samples per condition mean more data that each
tool can use to identify genes.
One other trend we found was the ef fect of the proportion
of up and down-regulated
genes. In our experiment we set up our data to examine
this in two dif ferent instances: between
and
and between
and
. Interestingly , the results between
and𝐵 6 2 56 2 5 𝐵 01 2 5 0 𝐵 2 0 0 02 0 0 0 𝐵 04 0 0 0 𝐵 6 2 56 2 5 𝐵 01 2 5 0
were nearly identical in almost every statistic. On
the other hand, there was a huge disparity
across the board between
and
datasets. In Figure 4b we not only see around a 10%𝐵 2 0 0 02 0 0 0 𝐵 04 0 0 0
decrease in AUC compared to Figure 4a, but in almost
every case, the variance is greater , and the
results are less consistent across dataset versions.
This indicates that an uneven number of up and
downregulated negatively impacts the accuracy of results
when the dif ference between them is
greater . One possible reason for this is that most
of the tool normalization factors do not assume
such an imbalanced distribution, leading to more false
positives. Real-life RNA  data is rarely
built like
in which ⅓ of the genes are all upregulated, so it stands to reason that the tools𝐵 04 0 0 0
would have a more challenging time distinguishing
between DE genes in this situation.
For the full set of graphs on each statistic and
dataset, please see the appendix at the end
of the report.
Area under the ROC Curve (AUC)
Figures 5a and 5b
The figures above shows boxplots
of the values of AUC on
and
respectively.𝐵 6 2 56 2 5 𝑃 6 2 56 2 5
The ROC curve is a popular graphical tool for comparing
the performance of multiple
classifiers. The name “ROC'' is an acronym for receiver
operating characteristics, which comes
from communications theory . The overall performance
of a classifier is given by the area under
the ROC curve (AUC). So, the lar ger the AUC, the better
the classifier . We could observe that
DESeq2, edgeR, voom.limma, ttest and PoissonSeq have
fairly similar AUC results, having a
difference that maxes out at 0.1 depending on the
dataset being analyzed. ABSSeq performed the
worst across all datasets, resulting in AUC lower
than 0.65 even with the datasets with 10
samples per condition. This makes ABSSeq an inferior
tool to use if AUC is an important metric
to take into account while working for a project,
as it will only produce poor or worthless AUC
results.
Across the tools that performed well, edgeR excelled
in datasets with the most samples
per condition excluding those in
and
.
In these two datasets, DESeq2 and
voom.limma𝑆 6 2 56 2 5 𝑅 6 2 56 2 5
performed far better . However , when there were fewer
samples per condition, DESeq2 produces
the best AUC results for most datasets. It is worth
noting that PoissonSeq performed worse than
the other tools, even in the
dataset.
This is surprising, since PoissonSeq performs dif ferential𝑃 6 2 56 2 5
gene expression analysis using a Poisson log-linear model. Also, the AUC of all the tools
performs less well when performed on the single and
random outlier dataset.
Type I Error Rate
Figures 6a and 6b
The figures above shows boxplots
of the values of Type I Error Rate on
and
respectively𝑃 00 𝑆 00
which both show a clear difference in rank between
ABSSeq and the other tools.
Type I Error Rate, or False Positive Rate, calculates
the proportion of genes incorrectly
identified as dif ferentially expressed by dividing
the number of false positives by the total
number of non-dif ferentially expressed genes. This
metric was calculated on the datasets with
zero truly dif ferentially expressed genes that were
meant to emulate circumstances where
differentially expressed genes were expected to be
rare. Thus, false positives would need to be
controlled. ABSSeq performs the best in this metric
in particular , as it has very low Type I Error
rates compared to the rest of the tools. This could
indicate that ABSSeq is more useful when
there are fewer dif ferentially expressed genes, since
it has a higher threshold for classification.
Most tools average below 10% false positive rate,
which is an acceptable threshold, yet there
were still some note trends. Like sensitivity , samples
per condition did not have as drastic of an
effect on performance as it did with other tools.
In some cases, the data with lar ger samples per
condition had higher average false positive rates.
Also, PoissonSeq was the most unstable
amongst the tools, as it performed with high variance
in dif ferent datasets and had the highest
rank across almost every dataset. On the contrary ,
voom.limma and ttest had low variances and
performed better on the datasets with outliers (
and
) compared to DESeq2and EdgeR,𝑆 00 𝑅 00
which ranked better only on
.𝑃 00
Accuracy
Figures 7a
and
7b
The figures above shows boxplots
of the values of Accuracy on
and
respectively.𝐵 2 0 0 02 0 0 0 𝐵 04 0 0 0
In general, DESeq2 and edgeR would perform similarly ,
in terms of accuracy , in all
datasets (including the Poisson dataset), except one
differentiating point is how DESeq2 would
not perform nearly as well as edgeR when there are
more genes upregulated in condition 2
compared to condition 1. As shown in the left graph
above (
Figur e 7a
), DESeq2’ s accuracy
would fall short of edgeR about ~0.02, proving that
edgeR is a better statistic than DESeq2 when
accounting for accuracy of predicting truly DE genes,
but DESeq2 would also be a viable tool.
However , in the right graph above (
Figur e 7b
), DESeq2’ s
accuracy cannot compare to edgeR as
it performs worse than almost all tools when there
is an uneven distribution of genes upregulated
in condition 2 compared to condition 1. This discrepancy
could be due to the fact that DESeq2’ s
normalization method uses the geometric mean of the
genes of the samples in which the tool
does not take into account how a sample could have
more upregulated/downregulated genes than
the other condition.
Figures 8a and 8b
The figures above shows boxplots
of the values of Accuracy on
and
respectively.𝑆 6 2 56 2 5 𝑅 6 2 56 2 5
It is worth noting that while ABSSeq did not perform well on the baseline & Poisson
generated datasets, ABSSeq performed better than almost
all tools when handling datasets with a
single outlier or random outlier with unusually high
counts. As shown in the left graph above
(
Figur e 8a
), ABSSeq would perform the best when there
were 2 or 5 samples per condition, but
would produce subpar results when there are 10 samples
per condition. Based on the other
metrics, the previous trend would show that as the
number of samples per condition increases,
the more the metric would increase. In this case,
however , ABSSeq is lower -ranking than the
other tools with the most number of samples per condition,
reinforcing the idea that this tool is
substandard for DEA, as it can only perform better
than other tools when there are only 2 or 5
samples per condition. Further , in the graph on the
right (
Figur e 8b
), ABSSeq performs the best
when there are 2 or 5 samples per condition, but is
outperformed by both ttest and voom.limma
when there are random outliers. So, voom.limma or
ttest should be utilized in the real life setting
instead of ABSSeq because outliers are usually random
in a real-life dataset. Researchers
typically work with datasets that contain greater
than 10 samples per condition for more precise
results, so these findings prove that ABSSeq is only
correct when there are a few samples per
condition which are not realistic.
False Discovery Rate
Figures 9a and 9b
The figures above shows boxplots
of the values of False Discovery Rate on
and𝐵 6 2 56 2 5 𝐵 2 0 0 02 0 0 0
respectively.
Figures 10a and 10b
The figures above shows boxplots
of the values of False Discovery Rate on
and𝑆 6 2 56 2 5 𝑅 6 2 56 2 5
respectively.
In all graphs, DESeq2, edgeR, voom.limma, and ttest,
all rank around 0.5 for false
discovery rate with a small variance, which means
that these tools are good at predicting whether
a gene is dif ferentially expressed. When the dif ferentially
expressed genes were regulated in
different directions, increasing the number of DE
genes from 1,250 to 4000 (i.e.,
→
),𝐵 6 2 56 2 5 𝐵 2 0 0 02 0 0 0
FDR would be controlled and decreased (
Figur es 9a
&
9b
). On the other hand, for instances
where DE genes were regulated in the same directions
(i.e.,
→
) had no influence
on𝐵 01 2 5 0 𝐵 04 0 0 0
the control for FDR; it did not increase or decrease.
However , there is a similar trend occurring
here where DESeq2 and edgeR will perform better than
voom.limma & ttest except in cases
where there is an outlier (
Figur es 10a
&
10b
). This
strengthens the fact that voom.limma & ttest
are better tools when there are outliers with abnormally
high counts.
In all synthetic datasets, ABSSeq has a high false
discovery rate which means that it
doesn’ t perform nearly as well as the other tools
in terms of predicting whether a gene is truly
differentially expressed. Furthermore, almost all
tools portray low variance in all graphs, except
for ABSSeq, which demonstrates how ABSSeq may not
be performing analysis correctly most of
the time because of how spread out the data points
are from the mean. In addition to the graphs
portraying the other metrics, it seems as if ABSSeq
performs the worst compared to the other
tools. This is reasonable as ABSSeq is a new RNA-Seq
analysis tool that has recently emer ged
14
.
Similar to ABSSeq, PoissonSeq doesn’ t perform as
well as the other tools (DESeq2,
edgeR, voom.limma, & ttest) as it received False Discovery
Rates higher than 0.5, but still
performed better than ABSSeq. However , there is a
unique trend here where the FDR would
decrease as the number of samples increased for PoissonSeq. This makes sense as PoissonSeq
uses a log-linear model to calculate a score statistic
for dif ferential gene expression, so the more
samples the model has, the better the tool would perform.
Consequently , it doesn’ t perform as
well on the Poisson distributed synthetic dataset,
which is surprising because PoissonSeq
performs dif ferential gene expression analysis using
a Poisson log-linear model.
Sensitivity and Specificity
Figures 11a and 11b
The figures above shows boxplots
of the values of Sensitivity on
and
respectively.𝑃 6 2 56 2 5 𝑅 6 2 56 2 5
Figures 1 1a and 1 1b look at sensitivity , which measures
the tools' ability to correctly
identify the truly dif ferentially expressed genes.
Sensitivity is calculated by dividing the number
of genes correctly identified as DE by the total number
of predictions of DE genes. As with most
other statistics, the best performing tool overall
was DESeq2, with edgeR close behind. Again,
we saw better sensitivity performance with greater
samples per condition, and in general, the
difference between the tools was significantly smaller
in the datasets with 10 samples per
condition. In all datasets,  all of the tools (except
ABSSeq) had results typically being within
0.05 of each other . However , this was not the case
for the
dataset, which had more𝑅 6 2 56 2 5
significant disparities between tools ranks.
Unlike
in our other graphs, voom.limma and ttest did
not show a significant relative increase in performance
in the datasets with outliers. However , we
did see a stronger performance with PoissonSeq on
the
dataset compared to the other𝑃 6 2 56 2 5
datasets in which it ranked on the lower half of the
tools. Overall, there were no trends seen in
the sensitivity graphs that were not already depicted
in previous graphs, which gauge total
performance and reliability , such as AUC.
Figures 12a and 12b
The figures above shows boxplots
of the values of Specificity on
and
respectively.𝐵 6 2 56 2 5 𝐵 04 0 0 0
Specificity is a measure of how well each tool correctly
identifies non-dif ferentially
expressed genes. Specificity is calculated by dividing
the number of truly non-dif ferentially
expressed genes by the total number of predicted non-dif ferentially
expressed genes.
Unsurprisingly , ABSSeq was by far the best tool in
this metric. As we have seen previously ,
ABSSeq typically classified genes as non-dif ferentially
expressed at a much higher rate than
other tools. In almost every dataset, the average
specificity from ABSSeq was between 0.97 and
1, especially with greater samples per condition.
Outside of ABSSeq, each tool's performance
was very comparable in most cases, only dif ferent
by an average of 0.005 between them. Also,
PoissonSeq was noticeably worse compared to the rest
of the tools. Interestingly , unlike some of
the other statistics, outside of ABSSeq and, to a
lesser extent, edgeR, there was no increase in
performance with an increase in samples per condition.
This means that increasing the number of
samples won't significantly af fect specificity in
most cases. In fact, for the
dataset,
the𝐵 04 0 0 0
performance actually worsened with the increase of
number of samples, which could be due to
normalization methods as mentioned earlier .
Again we saw a noticeable increase in performance
of voom.limma and ttest in the
datasets with outliers compared to DESeq2, edgeR,
and PoissonSeq. However , much like the
accuracy graphs, DESeq2 and edgeR had higher ranks
in specificity for the
datasets.𝑃 6 2 56 2 5
Overall, it seems like DESeq2 and edgeR are the clear
choices to use when sensitivity is
significant to control. Still, in cases where researchers
need to be sure that genes are not
differentially expressed, ABSSeq may be a viable option.
Even in the data where most genes
were dif ferentially expressed, ABSSeq controlled specificity the best and seems to be the most
useful when the true number of dif ferentially expressed
genes is lower .
Real Life Data
Using the RNA-Seq data on the three psychiatric disorders
(schizophrenia, bipolar
disorder , and major depressive disorder) from last
quarter , we also performed these tools on the
gene matrix count we generated the previous quarter .
Figure 13
The figure above shows boxplots of the number
of genes of Schizophrenia patients that each tool
yielded
as differentially expressed.
Figures 14a, 14b, 14c.
The figure above shows venn
diagrams that represent the overlap among the set
of DE genes
found by different methods in the Schizophrenia section.
First, we compared the number of DE genes found by each tool (
Figur e 13
). Depending
on the psychiatric disease, the actual number dif fered,
but we could see a general trend of ttest
and voom.limma being the highest, while ABSSeq had
the fewest among all diseases. It can also
be noted that DESeq2, edgeR, ttest and voom.limma
had very similar results on all diseases, so it
is hard to make conclusions about which genes performed
better than others since we don’ t know
the true DE genes. The results produced here correlate
to the results found in the simulated
datasets where DESeq2 and edgeR would perform similarly ,
whereas voom.limma and ttest
would also function similarly . Although voom.limma
& ttest identified more DE genes here, our
findings with the simulated datasets show that DESeq2
and edgeR should be more precise in
their statistical analysis of finding truly DE genes.
Then, we studied the overlap of genes classified as
differentially expressed among the
tools (
Figur e 14
). We have noticed that tools that
used negative binomial distribution (i.e.,
DESeq2, edgeR, ttest, and voom.limma) shared the most
similar results (
Figur e 14a
) in which
they identified the same 2,731 genes DE. For most
of the datasets, more than half of the gene
results yielded by such tools were classified as DE.
On the other hand, we could see a lar ge
discrepancy between tools that did not use negative
binomial distribution. In particular ,
PoissonSeq and ABSSeq tend to classify genes to be
DE that most other tools refuted. As we
mentioned earlier , we do not know the actual parameters
of the real-life dataset. Hence, we are
unable to guarantee which genes are truly DE, and
can only note the similarities and dif ferences
between the results of our tools.
Discussion
Generally , across all graphs, it can be observed
that as sample size increases, so does the
accuracy , which makes sense as the more samples we
have per condition, the more data we have
to conclude from. Additionally , we observed that DESeq2
and edgeR perform roughly the same
in cases where there is a ratio upregulated/down-regulated
in both samples (i.e.,
,
,𝐵 6 2 56 2 5 𝐵 2 0 0 02 0 0 0
etc.). This makes sense, since both tools are very
similar in that they both assume that no genes
are dif ferentially expressed. However , for cases where
more genes are upregulated in one
condition than the other (i.e.,
), edgeR
would typically perform better .  As mentioned prior ,𝐵 04 0 0 0
DESeq uses a “geometric” normalization strategy . In
contrast, edgeR uses a weighted mean oflog ratios-based method, which means both normalize using size/normalization factors. There is
a possibility that edgeR’ s normalization method performs
better when there is an uneven
distribution of upregulated/downregulated genes.
Moreover , it seems that in all graphs where there
are no outliers with randomized counts,
DESeq2 and edgeR perform better than the other tools,
but for cases where there are outliers
(random & single), voom.limma and ttest would perform
better than these two tools. However , it
was interesting to see that edgeR would perform worse
than DESeq2 in cases where there are
outliers because edgeR is known to be a software that
can handle random outliers. In all cases, it
looks like voom.limma and ttest would perform the
same, which could be explained by the fact
that they use the ttest to perform dif ferential gene
expression, but voom.limma performs better
since it doesn’ t use the same process of DEA  as ttest.
Voom.limma uses voom transformation
from the limma package, then a linear model for all
gene expression. This is more thorough in
contrast with ttest's, which just performs DEA  after
normalization.
According to the findings for all metrics, PoissonSeq
did not perform well on the Poisson
simulated dataset, which is surprising because we
assumed that the Poisson log-linear model for
the tool would predict the true DE genes from counts
drawn from a Poisson distribution.
However , we believe that PoissonSeq may not have performed
nearly as well as we thought
because we generated 12,500 genes, but only 6,250
were drawn from the Poisson distribution.
So, we concluded that PoissonSeq's Poisson log-linear
model's method would only perform well
on the Poisson distribution only if almost all or
most of the counts were drawn from the Poisson
distribution. Overall it is not surprising that PoissonSeq
did not do very well as it is a relatively
old tool that is not regularly used and utilizes unconventional
normalization methods. Therefore,
the methods used by edgeR & DESeq2 may be better for
DEA  regardless of the distribution of
the counts.
As mentioned prior , ABSSeq performed relatively poorly
across all metrics even though
it seems like a reliable tool that uses absolute count
differences between 2 conditions. It is
interesting to note that this method is a brand new
approach by researchers as DEA  is usually
performed based on a distribution. In its poor performance,
it could be that it used qtotal for
normalization instead of Trimmed Means of M-values
like most of the other tools did.
PoissonSeq also did relatively poorly , and it too
used a dif ferent normalization method unique to
that tool. It could be that normalization has a more
significant ef fect on the results, especiallysince ABSSeq was similar to DESeq2 and edgeR in statistical methods as they all use a negative
binomial distribution. Given that this tool is new ,
there should be more thorough research on
ABSSeq on real-life or distinct synthetic datasets
to see if it will continue to perform poorly or if
this investigation is just a fluke. Although this
tool doesn’ t utilize methods that have been the
norm, it is still important to investigate how this
tool performs as it has potential in DEA.
In all metrics shown in Appendix, NOISeq was not
included as an investigation because
the outputs of NOISeq on the synthetic data did not
include p-values of each gene. We cannot
make conclusions about significant dif ferences. As
a result, we could not make inferences about
how NOISeq performs for DEA, but this could be something
further studied by performing
separate, independent research for this tool.
Another limitation to our study is that we used simulated
data in which we cannot control
for covariates of our samples, which many of our tools
use to implement their models for
performing DEA. For instance, DESeq2 allows users
to build full models or reduced models for
DEA. Still, our simulated datasets do not specify
the gender or age of our samples, so we cannot
use covariates as functions of our model, which could
have produced dif ferent results. This is
one major problem of our research as real-life datasets
usually have information about the
samples used for analysis, so our results reflect
what is produced by the percent of aligned reads
and do not consider the possible confounding variables.
Conclusion
As expected, no one software performed better than
the others in all of the metrics we
measured, further proving that researchers need to
be particular when choosing what tool to use
in a given study . As more general and all-encompassing
statistics, the results on AUC and
accuracy show that DESeq2 and edgeR are solid choices
for most studies. However , if runtime is
a major factor , as can be the case, as RNA  extraction
becomes cheaper and more available,
edgeR may be the better choice since, on average,
it took many factors less time (~2-3 minutes)
than DESeq2. Other tools such as voom.limma and ttest
performed exceptionally well on
datasets generated with the Poisson distribution instead
of the negative binomial distribution,
which is used to simulate variation in the input data.
This could indicate that it may be better to
use these tools when the data is known to have similar
variability . Finally , ABSSeq, which was
by far the worst in almost all other circumstances,
proved to be the best in terms of False PositiveRate in the datasets with zero dif ferentially expressed genes. This shows that ABSSeq could be
more valuable when the expected number of dif ferentially
expressed genes in a study is low
since it is more selective when dif ferentiating between
genes, leading to lower false positives.
Across all experiments, one trend that we noticed
was that an increase in samples per
condition drastically increased every tool's performance
in every statistic. While in a given
experiment, it is not always feasible or practical
to increase the number of samples, we can still
prove how much more accurate results can be when the
number of samples is increased.
Specificity appeared to be the most af fected by samples
per condition, with the average
specificity across tools almost doubling between 2
and 10 samples. There was still a noticeable
difference in other statistics, often increasing by
close to 50% with a sample size of 10 compared
to 2.
Overall while our research found similar results
to previous studies in the past
13
, there is
still much more that can be explored in this area
especially as it continues to grow and be
improved upon. In our research, we only used default
parameters for most of the tools to perform
differential expression analysis as a starting point.
For example, DESeq2, we utilized a Wald test
to perform statistical analysis. For further investigation,
more research should be performed on
how the tools would perform if the parameters were
tuned dif ferently from what was discussed
here since some tools may have parameters that are
documented to perform better in particular
situations that we simulated in our synthetic data.
For instance, next time, we can delve deeper
into how the results would alter if we utilized a
Likelihood Ratio Test instead. In addition, our
findings were primarily observational as it is dif ficult
to quantify and understand why exactly
different software produce varying results based on
the complexity of the statistical methods
used across tools. The cleanliness of the synthetic
data also needs to be considered when thinking
about the results because real-life RNA  sequencing
data is much messier in practice, with many
steps being required to even get to dif ferential expression,
each with its variability that can af fect
results. While we used the random and single outlier
functions to attempt to simulate this idea, it
may not necessarily translate the same way in practice.
It would be preferable to test against even
more types of diverse real-life datasets to validate
our results. Finally , there are, of course,
dozens of other software that could be tested against.
Still, we believe that the tools we chose
represented an excellent mixture of those commonly
used in other studies and some that takedifferent statistical approaches to observe how their use af fects the results and helps guide
decisions in the future on which tools to use.

","This study compared different tools for differential gene expression analysis using RNA-Seq data. The tools included ABSSeq, voom.limma, PoissonSeq, DESeq2, NOISeq, ttest, and edgeR. The study analyzed synthetic datasets and a real-life dataset from patients with psychiatric disorders. The results showed that DESeq2 and edgeR performed similarly and were the overall best tools in most metrics and datasets. However, other tools had advantages in certain situations. ABSSeq performed better when there were outliers with unusually high counts, while voom.limma and ttest showed benefits in controlling type I errors when the number of truly differentially expressed genes was low. Overall, no single tool was applicable in every situation, and researchers should consider the specific characteristics of their data when choosing a tool for differential gene expression analysis."

Background
This study aims to ﬁnd gene expression similarities and diﬀerences between patients of Alzheimer's (AD) and
Parkinson's (PD). The study uses sequencing data from microRNA (miRNA) found in two of the body's bioﬂuids:
cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) and blood serum (SER). Although these disorders are experienced by many people,
little is known about what speciﬁcally causes the two diseases and how to prevent or cure them. The diﬃculty in
ﬁnding these solutions arises from the complexity of the ""pathomechanisms"" underlying the diseases, as well as
their tendencies to have early stages that are asymptomatic, making detection very challenging until symptoms
set in .
With our analysis, we aim to study the genetic causes underlying the two diseases by inspecting the sequencing
data found in patients' bodies in the form of miRNA sequences. Uncovering the genetics behind the diseases
can help researchers better their understanding of the development of AD and PD in humans and improve their
chances of ﬁnding eﬃcient preventative measures for the two disorders. Furthermore, the similarities that we
may ﬁnd between the disorders can aid in the research of neural disorders in general, and contribute to early
diagnosis, prevention, and cures.
Psychiatric Disorders
Alzheimer's
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disorder that heavily impacts brain function in that it slowly
deteriorates memory and thinking skills, leading to symptoms like forgetting recent events or conversations, to
eventually losing the ability to carry out simple tasks or even recognize friends and family members. Diﬃculty in
reasoning and thinking is also a common symptom, especially with abstract concepts like numbers, again
making everyday tasks like paying bills challenging. AD also impairs people's abilities to make decisions in
everyday situations, like driving. The principal risk factor of Alzheimer's is age; people become more likely to
develop AD as they grow older. Family history can also increase a person's chances of developing the disease.
A genetic link to increased chance of AD shows in the form of a variation of the gene APOE e4, something we
will deﬁnitely explore further in our study. As of now, there is no known cure for AD, but medications have been
known to improve or slow the eﬀect of the disease, and programs and caregivers help to support AD patients .
Parkinson's
Parkinson's disease is a progress nervous system disorder that impacts movement. There are a myriad of
symptoms that constitute PD, including a tremor (trembling) in a limb like a hand or ﬁngers, slowed movement,
rigid muscles, and impaired posture and balance. PD is also sometimes accompanies by other complications,1
2like cognitive issues (trouble thinking, dementia), emotional changes (like depression), swallowing, chewing, and
eating problems, among others. The principal risk factor of PD is age; PD usually develops in people age 60 or
older. Other risk factors include family history and sex (men are more likely to develop it than women). As of
now, there are no known cures or even prevention methods for Parkinson's. However, there are medications that
can ease the symptoms, as well as surgeries that can regulate parts of the brain to improve symptoms .
miRNA
Our sequence data comes from the encodings of microRNA strands. microRNA (miRNA) are a class of non-
coding RNAs that regulate gene expression. Speciﬁcally, they bind to speciﬁc mRNA and prevent those target
mRNA from translating the necessary directions to produce certain proteins. Because of the behavior of miRNA,
it will be worthwhile to explore which miRNA are binding to which mRNA, and subsequently what proteins are
being down-regulated (lowly expressed). These proteins could then be contributing factors to the symptoms
and/or development of the two diseases .
CSF/SER
The miRNA in our study was sourced from two locations (speciﬁcally, ﬂuids found in our body): cerebrospinal
ﬂuid (CSF) and blood serum (SER). These two ﬂuids are part of the central nervous system, which are highly
impacted by both PD and AD. CSF cushions the brain and is a ""shock absorber"" for the central nervous system,
and also removes waste products from the brain . miRNAs can be found in the CSF and have been found to be
instrumental in responding to malignant tumors in the nervous system . Blood serum (or serum) is the ﬂuid that
blood cells move through, but without the plasma - it is the clear liquid that remains after blood clots . miRNA
is found in serum as ""secreted miRNAs"", meaning miRNA that has been excreted from cells or tissues .
Pipeline
For this project, the basic overview of our pipeline is that we want to access our data, preform necessary quality
checks (qc), then merge the inputs into a gene_matrix and feature table, normalize by outputting normalized
counts, return the LRT (Likelihood Ratio Test measures how well the model ﬁts ) plots in the analysis step, and
then ﬁnally visualize.
The overall pipeline is shown in Figure 1 below.3

Figure 1: Overview of Targets in PipelineGiven the restricted access to the raw dataset, we contacted Professor Kendall Jensen, author of the original
paper, who showed us the exRNA Atlas, a data repository of the Extracellular RNA Communication Consortium
(https://exrna-atlas.org/ (https://exrna-atlas.org/)) which includes small RNA sequencing and qPCR-derived
exRNA proﬁles from human and mouse bioﬂuids. The study's processed dataset was included in this repository
including the gene count matrix ﬁles for each sample.
The features table is generated from three diﬀerent sources:
SRA_RunTable.csv: NCBI's SRA Run table that held the age and SRA Run attributes
Table_S1.csv: The attributes table from the research paper that held many other attributes such as expired
age, PMI, plaque density, Braak Score.
exRNA_Atlas_CORE_Results.csv: Atlas core table that held information about the condition and bioﬂuid
These tables were all merged in the data step using Pandas merge feature, shown in Figure 2 below.
The ""qc"" target as show in Figure 3 is an optional step that can be used on the source fastq and bam ﬁles to
generate quality reports using FastQC and Picard. This step was not leveraged as the dataset did not have fastq
ﬁles but did already have the FastQC quality reports that we were able to analyze.
Figure 2: Data Target ImplementationThe next step is to execute the ""merge"" step: which takes all the gene count SRA ﬁles and merges them in one
gene matrix table using Pandas . The output will also be a gene experiments table which identiﬁes the sample
labels and the patient features (age, disorder etc) shown in Figure 4 below.1 0
After merging, we execute the ""normalize"" step: this imports the merged gene count matrix into a custom R
script which uses the DESeq2  module to generate two normalized matrix counts: one uses standard
normalization and the other Variable Stabilization Transformation shown in Figure 5 below.1 1
Figure 3: Quality Control Target Implementation
Figure 4: Merge Target ImplementationAfter normalizing we execute the ""analysis"" step: this generates 4 Likelihood Ratio test (LRT), a hypothesis test
that compares models in terms of how they ﬁt the available data by comparing the likelihood scores of the
models . Each of the 4 LRT's corresponds to one bioﬂuid and one disorder. The LRT will be compared against
that disorder versus the control group. Additionally, a MA Plot and Heatmap are generated. This is shown in
Figure 6 below.9
The ﬁnal step in this pipeline process is the ""visualize"" step. This generates the many charts and visualizations
we have implemented to show the results of our ﬁndings. This step takes in the VST Norm Counts as well as the
LRT MA-plot and Heatmap that are automatically generated and outputs all of our visualizations, shown in
Figure 7 below.
Figure 5: Normalize Target Implementation
Figure 6: Analysis Target ImplementationFinally, Figure 8 shows the entire pipeline from start to ﬁnish. The condition column was either Parkinson's,
Alzheimer's or a healthy patient. The bioﬂuid column holds the source of where the miRNA samples were taken
from, either serum or the cerebrospinal ﬂuid.
Figure 7: Visualize Target Implementation
Figure 8: Pipeline DetailsQuality Checks
Cutadapt
Cutadapt  is a tool that is used by geneticists to perform data cleaning on sequence data. When sequence
libraries are prepared, the process adds adapter sequences called ""primers"" to the actual miRNA sequences.
However, those types of sequences are not relevant to our analysis, and can actually negatively aﬀect our data
quality and our subsequent results. Therefore, the cutadapt tool removes those sequences, as well as any other
low-quality reads so that data is ready for analysis. However, since the data provided to us was not the ""raw""
data, we could not evaluate the quality of the data itself, nor could we perform any quality control like
performing cutadapt. The researchers who provided the data to us most likely already performed quality checks
and used a tool like cutadapt in data cleaning.
FastQC
FastQC  is a tool that is used in checking the quality of raw sequencing data before performing large-scale
analysis. The software tool calculates and outputs quality metrics of each of the sequence reads, which allows
us to determine whether to keep a sequence read, to “cut away” the extraneous parts of a sequence (using
cutadapt), or to leave out the read all together. The metrics (shown as graphs and tables) include “Per sequence
quality scores” which indicates the average quality of reads over the sequences of an SRA run, “Sequence
length distribution”, the distribution of sequence lengths, and an important factor, “Overrepresented
sequences”, which are sequences that are not found to be in the human genome, among other measurements.
Speciﬁcally for overrepresented sequences, FastQC marks these as “overrepresented” because it cannot ﬁnd
the source of the sequences; however, more often than not, they are adapters that have been “tacked on”
during the library preparation of the sequences, and are then caught by FastQC. This is where we would use the
cutadapt tool to cut out those unnecessary sections, or just completely leave the reads out of the analysis. In
the end, by combining all these factors, our decision to keep or leave out sequence reads follows the ERCC
(External RNA Controls Consortium) Quality Control Standards. These standards for our data (which is
speciﬁcally an exRNA-seq dataset) were drawn up at a Washington, DC conference in November 2015 in order
to have a universal set of quality check guidelines :
1. An individual RNA-Seq dataset is required to have a minimum of 100,000 reads that overlap (sense or
antisense) with any annotated RNA transcript in the host genome. The annotation includes all small RNAs,
such as miRNAs (from miRBase), piRNAs, tRNAs, snoRNAs, and circular RNAs, as well as long transcripts
from GENCODE, which includes both protein coding genes and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).
2. The fraction of reads that align to the host genome (after ﬁltering out contaminants, adaptor dimers and
ribosomal reads) that also align to any annotated RNA transcript (described in point #1) should be greater
than 0.5.
Below, we compare some of the FastQC outputs for reads that were marked as ""Pass"" versus those marked as
""Fail"".
FastQC outputs of failed vs passed healthy serum samples1 2
1 3
1 4As we can see in Figure 9, the quality of each base between the two sequence reads does not seem to be very
diﬀerent. It is likely that the ""failed"" sample on the left did not pass the ERCC quality control check for other
reasons, as shown above and outlined by the ERCC. Since we do not have access to the raw sequencing data,
there is no way to know for sure how they determined the ERCC pass/fail label.
Figure 9: Comparison of Failed/Passed Base Quality Metrics for Healthy Serum Samples
Figure 10: Example of 'Overrepresented sequences' listShown in Figure 10 is an example of a table/list of overrepresented sequences that FastQC detects in a
sequence read. FastQC labels these as either possible primer sequences (by matching with primers that certain
tools, like Illumina, use), or just ""No Hit"", meaning an unknown source. Either way, it is a starting point for
cleaning any sequences that failed the FastQC check, by removing these sequences with tools like cutadapt.
Otherwise, we could just leave that sequence read out of our analysis.
FastQC outputs of failed vs passed Parkinson's serum samples
Figure 11 shows the base quality over the sequences of the two samples is not vastly diﬀerent. Yet, the sample
on the left did not pass the ERCC quality check. So, looking further into the report, we note below that the
sample on the left did have an abnormal amount of N bases, which, in DNA sequencing terms, usually means
""unspeciﬁed"", or a base that could be attributed to any of the 4 (A, T, G, C) main bases . This uncertainty is
not meaningful, so the sequence itself was removed. There could also have been other factors to this removal,
particularly in regard to the ERCC standards.1 5
Figure 11: Comparison of Failed/Passed Base Quality Metrics for Parkinson's Serum

Experiments Features Table
The Run  column in the features table represents a unique ""ID"" of the sample collection for a patient in our
study. Each patient (healthy, Parkinson's, or Alzheimer's) has a sequencing sample run associated with it, and
serves to uniquely identify the sample in our study. The CONDITION  column corresponds to the disease that
each patient was aﬄicted by (Alzheimer's or Parkinson's), or if the patient was part of the control group
(healthy). The BIOFLUID  column designates the source of the sample from the patient's body (CSF or serum). 
sex  and expired_age  are the gender of the subject, and the age of the subject at death, respectively. The 
PMI  column stands for ""post-mortem interval"", which means the amount of time between the subject's death
and when the sample was collected from the body of the subject. PlaqueTotal , Plaque density , and 
TangleTotal  all correspond to the amounts of structures called plaques and tangles in the brain. Plaques
are dense clumps in the space between nerve cells in the brain, and are known to negatively impact the brain
cells around it. When they develop around brain areas like the hippocampus (which is a part of the brain that is
fundamental in the process of making memories), it leads to the dementia symptoms of Alzheimer's. Tangles are
also structures that develop in the brain that negatively aﬀect the transportation of neurons to and from certain
areas, altogether inhibiting brain function . Braak score , also referred to as ""braak stage"" is a score that is
used to measure the degree of brain dysfunction for both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients . LB Stage
corresponds to the stage of Lewy Body dementia, which is often related to Parkinson's disease. Lewy bodies
are clumps of proteins that develop in areas of the brain responsible for memory and movement - both are
impacted by Parkinson's . NIA-R  is the modiﬁed NIA-Reagan diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is based on
consensus recommendations for postmortem diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The criteria rely on both
neuroﬁbrillary tangles (Braak) and neuritic plaques (CERAD) . Finally, sn_depigmentation  is short for
substantia nigra depigmentation. The substantia nigra is a part of the midbrain; this brain region is usually found
to be depigmented in Parkinson's disease patients .
By inspecting these features, speciﬁcally performing EDA and doing research on what each of the values mean,
we can delve further into the analysis by determining what features will be important in the diﬀerential gene
analysis model in DESeq2, and which of them will signiﬁcantly diﬀerentiate between Alzheimer's, Parkinson's
and healthy patients in terms of their genetics.1 6

Uniqueness of the Data
After checking the uniqueness of the data there is only one sample from a single area of interest for each
subject. So we need to keep in mind that there may exist cross-subject diﬀerences for samples of diﬀerent
bioﬂuids.
Gender & Condition Breakdown of Each Bioﬂuid
We broke down the samples into two groups based on bioﬂuid, and then looked at the distribution of other
variables, namely gender, expired age, disease duration, PMI, total number of plaques, and total number of
tangles.
This dataset is comprised of 126 healthy control subjects, 110 subjects of Alzheimer's Diseases , and 107
Parkinson's Diseases patients.
Then, we broke the population by gender and bioﬂuids shown in Figure 13 below. Although the gender
distribution is mostly balanced, the dataset contains signiﬁcantly more female samples in the Parkinson's
disease group. Therefore, gender bias could potentially aﬀect the result of our analysis.Run SRR1568567 SRR1568730 SRR1568666 SRR1568510 SRR1568518

Table 2: Important Feature attributes for ﬁrst 5 Run SamplesVariable distributions Broken Down by Group in CSF and Serum
As shown in Figure 14 below, when comparing across conditions, more samples in the healthy control group
have a larger expired age in both CSF and Serum sample populations. The Alzheimer's group have shorter PMI
but higher total numbers of plaque and tangle in both CSF and Serum samples. When comparing across
bioﬂuids sample populations, the Alzheimer's group has a higher expired age in the CSF population than in the
Serum population. The Parkinson's group in the CSF population has slightly larger disease durations.
Although the distributions have slight diﬀerences, the distinction between the distribution of the samples of
cerebrospinal ﬂuid and that of serum is not too drastic to a degree where we need to handle anything especially
in our downstream analysis.
Figure 13: Samples breakdown by gender and bioﬂuid.""Disorder Markers""
As mentioned previously, NIA-R is a measurement for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. We wanted to validate if
the values of the samples in our dataset reﬂect this claim.
Figure 14: Distributions of the above variables.In Figure 15 below, in panel A, we saw that all the healthy control samples are either under the category ""criteria
not met"" or ""no AD"". Surprisingly, although it is expected that most of the AD samples are under the category
""high"" there are some of the PD samples under ""intermediate"" and ""low"" categories. It might suggest that there
exist some commonalities between AD and PD.
Since Lewy Bodies are closely associated with Parkinson's disease, it is reasonable to see there are only
Parkinson's samples in the LB stage categories in panel B below. Among those samples, most of them are
under limbic type and neocortical type. Under ""No lewy bodies"" category, there are no Parkinson's patients,
which further proves that lewy bodies are speciﬁc to Parkinson's disease in our dataset.
According to Poewe et al., compared to control, Parkinson's disease is deﬁned by sn depigmentation . So it is
intuitive to see, in panel C, the Parkinson's group has the most severe cases. However, same as what happened
in NIA-R distribution, there is not a clear separation between AD and PD, namely, there are still some AD
patients in the ""mild"", ""moderate"", or even ""severe"" categories.2 1
Braak score is used to classify the degree of pathology in both PD and AD. However, in our dataset, although
we can see a clearly diﬀerent distribution for AD patients (the count increases as the stages go higher), there is
no clear separation between the PD patients and the healthy control (panel D).Bioﬂuid Region
During our EDA of the three bioﬂuid regions speciﬁed in the replication project, we narrowed our focus to
determine how similar the two bioﬂuid regions of the study were when it came to the basic variables explored
above (namely expired_age , DiseaseDuration , PMI , PlaqueTotal , and TangleTotal ).
Mean Breakdown of Disorders in Each Bioﬂuid
Figure 15: ""Disorder Markers"" Distribution of Healthy, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's
samples.In Table 3 below, we can determine some important information about patients that suﬀer from the diseases
versus healthy patient samples. Clearly, the plaque and tangle counts are much higher in Alzheimer's patients,
which is expected because these structures are found primarily in the brains of people with Alzheimer's.
Another important point to note is that the disease duration of Parkinson's patients is signiﬁcantly higher than
the other people, due to the fact that Parkinson's is a slowly progressive disorder and develops gradually (more
gradually than Alzheimer's). Therefore, the average disease duration of Parkinson's is much higher than the
other patients .2 2
Correlation Observation in Serum and Cerebrospinal Bioﬂuids
Here, we inspect the correlation between features in our feature table within both serum and cerebrospinal
samples in Figure 16 below.
For serum samples, the most positively correlated variables seem to be PlaqueTotal  and TangleTotal
with a high correlation of 0.71; this follows because the presence (or absence) of both the plaque and tangle
structures in the brain is related to whether or not someone has Alzheimer's disease, as these structures aﬀect
the brain in ways that cause the symptoms of AD. Another set of variables that seem to be positively correlated
is PMI  and DiseaseDuration , with a correlation of 0.26. This correlation could be a result of the
researchers' process for sample collection, since post-mortem interval and disease duration do not seem to
have a genetic or biological relationship. DiseaseDuration  has a negative correlation with both 
PlaqueTotal  and TangleTotal . When the duration of the disease is long, then both plaque and tangle
amounts are small, and vice versa.
In CSF, the most positively correlated variables are PlaqueTotal  and TangleTotal , both of which are
found in similar amounts in Alzheimer's patients. DiseaseDuration  and expired_age  were found to be
negatively correlated, which follows because if the disease lasts a prolonged period of time, the patient is more
likely to die sooner rather than later.expired_ageDiseaseDurationPMIPlaqueTotalTangleTotal

Table 3: Numeric feature attributes Grouped By Condition and BioﬂuidWe have seen that the overall correlation between Plaque Total and Tangle Total in both bioﬂuid samples are
high, but after previous results from Table 3, we know that the distribution of those two measurements are
diﬀerent for the AD group with high totals. Therefore, we plot the correlation per disorder in Table 4 and Table 5
that shows that Plaque Total and Tangle Total have a higher correlation of AD compared to PD and healthy;
speciﬁcally serum has a correlation of 0.68 in AD compared to the Healthy and PD which are 0.42 and 0.51
respectively and similarly cerebrospinal has a correlation of 0.68 in AD compared to the Healthy and PD which
are 0.42 and 0.48 respectively.

Table 4: Serum Bioﬂuid PlaqueTotal and TangleTotal CorrelationGene Matrix
Another important step before we step into the formal analysis is to get familar with our gene matrix. Here, we
explored some basic properties including counts, missingness, basic distributions and basic correlations. In the
full gene matrix that includes all the sequences, we have a lot of NaN values because not every sequence is
detected in our sample. We started by looking at how many sequences are missing for one sample and how
many samples do not have a certain sequence, that is, the number of missing values of the columns and rows
of the matrix.PlaqueTotalTangleTotal

Figure 17: Distribution of miRNA count missingness.According to Figure 17 and 18 above, a lot of miRNA sequences only exist in some samples (Figure 17) and
most of the samples have a large amount of miRNA sequences missing. It indicates that miRNA sequence set
may be speciﬁc to individuals, which makes our ﬁnding even more interesting if we can ﬁnd several common
miRNAs that are signiﬁcantly up or down regulated among all samples.
Processing of Data
Merging counts
The data target step automatically downloaded from the exRNA Atlas database a gene count ﬁle for each SRA
Run sample. This gene count table has a column that indicates the abundance count. The 322 abundance ﬁles
were merged into one gene count ﬁle. Special care was needed to ensure that the columns and rows match up -
the columns were the SRA runs, and the rows were the gene counts. The output was a table with over 180K
genes, however most of the genes had no overlap amongst the SRA samples. After removing null rows, the ﬁnal
gene matrix table had 400+ miRNA. A portion of the ﬁnal gene matrix table is shown in Table 6 below.

Table 6: Subset of the gene matrix of top 4 miRNA's based on count versus ﬁrst 4 SRA

features of interest for all the SRA Run's, included in the gene matrix.
Furthermore, the following cleanup was done in the merge step:
The sample SRR1568391 was removed due to the SRA Run table having two rows which had the same
SRA number but with diﬀerent values.
The imputation with TangleTotal attribute as it had 2 samples with missing data which was replaced with the
mean (6.63).
Normalized Gene Count
The process of normalization used the merged gene matrix and feature experiment table generated from the
merge step, and then used DESeq2's transform to generate a normalized count matrix ﬁle. As well as outputting
the standard normalized count matrix we also performed Variance Stabilization Transformation (VST) to generate
an additional normalized matrix which used the parametric ﬁtting type. VST transforms data is by creating new
values in terms of y where the variability of the new y-values is unrelated to the x-values . VST ﬁnds a function
that can be applied to the original x values to generate the new y-values. Methods like VST and normalization
allow us to primarily scale our data so that it is in a format that allows us to perform further analysis. The values
in our data become more manageable all while still maintaining their original statistical importance and meaning,
especially if our variables in our pre-normalized data have diﬀerent scales .
The descriptive statistics for both the normalized and the VST normalized gene matrix is shown in Table 8 and 9
below.2 3

SRR1568567 as well as SRR1568584, seen in Figure 19 below. The result of the R Pearson correlation of 0.97
shows a strong indication that the data from both matrices is consistent. For further downstream processing, we
used the VST gene matrix.2Average Sample

Table 9: VST gene matrix descriptive statistics summarized for all samples.Remove missing sequences
We merged the counts based on the readCounts_miRNAmature_sense.txt for each sample. This generated a
merged gene matrix that has approximately 1,800 rows, but many were repeated miRNAs. So we grouped rows
together based on the same miRNA to avoid miRNA counts that were artiﬁcially low. Finally, based on the
original paper  we reduced our focus to the top 400 miRNAs by prioritizing the rows that had the most total
gene counts.1
PCA
We performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the VST gene matrix for two PCA Plots, one with the
grouping set to disorder and another plot with the grouping set to bioﬂuid.
PCA uses linear combinations to explain the variance-covariance structure of a set of variables. Data reduction
and data interpretation are the main reasons for the use of PCA with the latter being the method we
incorporated in the replication project . For the purposes of this project, we did not remove any samples from
our data thus negating the need to do any sort of dimensionality reduction of our data. In doing so, we did not
experience any reduction in our data in terms of size and scope which would be common in other PCA
implementations. We used PCA purely on an exploratory level where we could observe relationships within our
data that may not have been as obvious to us. In Figure 20 below, there are visibly two groups formed in both
the left and right charts. However, the spread of every disorder and bioﬂuid, respectively, is relatively equal
across the chart.2 5
Figure 19: Two SRA Run's regression of log norm vs VST counts.Missing of Genes
Another analysis we did was with the entire set of counts which not only included miRNA's but also protein
coding genes. The combined gene matrix ﬁle has approximately 180K genes but most were missing across all
samples and are thus not relevant for analysis and compromise quality and performance of the analysis.
Furthermore, we can identify the top and bottom genes based on a statistic for each gene across the samples
that measures the spread against the mean normalized count. Genes which had little spread are likely
candidates that might not be important as they do not signiﬁcantly vary across the samples. The spread statistic
we developed was the L1 distance against the mean. Table 10 below shows the top 3 and bottom 3 genes and
the spread values. The gene with the highest count variance was mir-486a-5p and the bottom ranked gene was
mir-2797d.

The analysis of the data was performed using the same technique in the research paper , namely to consider
each bioﬂuid separately, and within each bioﬂuid to consider each disorder (versus control) separately. This
resulted in 4 combinations of analysis computations that were performed. With the top genes identiﬁed, we
ﬁltered only the samples for the particular bioﬂuid (Serum, Cerebrospinal ﬂuid) and then further ﬁltered based on
one of the 2 disorders (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's) plus the control. The basis of the analysis was the Likelihood
Ratio Test (LRT), which is a hypothesis test based on a full and reduced model using the DESeq2 package. The
model used the following variables:
expired_age
sex
PMI
sn_depigmentation
Braak_Score
TangleTotal
Plaque_density
PlaqueTotal
The outcome variable was Disorder which was not included in the reduced model. The premise of the LRT is to
compare models in terms of how they ﬁt the available data by comparing the likelihood scores of the two
models  using a statistical test of the goodness-of-ﬁt between two models. The full model with Disorder is
compared to a reduced model without Disorder . The output from the analysis was a LRT table which included
the baseMean, log2 Fold Change, lfcSE, stat, the pvalue, and adjusted pvalue. The descriptive summary of LRT
in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid for Parkinson's is shown in Table 11 below.1

Table 11: The LRT descriptive summary for bioﬂuid Cerebrospinal ﬂuid for Parkinsons.MA Plot
The LRT data for each of the 4 comparisons was used to generate a 2x2 MA Plot shown in Figure 21 below.
This is a scatter plot of the mean of the normalized counts against the log fold change. There does not appear
to be any highly signiﬁcant patterns as the data points appear to have a similar distribution.
Figure 21: MA Plot for each bioﬂuid versus each disorder.Heat Maps
Heatmaps were generated from the LRT data by selecting the top 20 miRNA's based on the average mean
normalized count and then plotting against the SRA samples. Each of the 4 analysis regions is plotted in a 2x2
heatmaps in Figure 22 below. Heatmaps allow us to observe speciﬁc values of interest across two axis variables
in the form of a grid with colored cells . The variables we have used for our axes are the patients and the
miRNAs identiﬁed across our patient samples, with the main value of interest being the miRNA expression
between patients of diﬀerent disorders. By observing our value of interest, miRNA expression, we can determine
if any patterns or associations exist within our 4 analysis regions. It appears that Parkinson's across the
bioﬂuids are more similar and Alzheimers across the bioﬂuids are more similar, this is based on the general
trends seeing that Parkinson's has less intensity with raw Z-scores closer to 0 and Alzheimers having higher
intensity with extreme raw Z-scores -4 and 4. However, one noticeable diﬀerence is that the placement of the
coloring across the heat map is more similar between the bioﬂuids. Meaning that cerebrospinal ﬂuid across
Parkinsons and Alzheimers has a more similar color mapping across starting with higher Z-scores (red) then to
lower Z-scores (blue). Similarly, serum across Parkinsons and Alzheimers has a more similar color mapping
across starting with lower Z-scores (blue) then to higher Z-scores (red). This means that Alzheimers has higher
raw Z-scores than Parkinsons, but more importantly the notable similarities in the color scheme across bioﬂuids
means that there is some commonality between diseases.2 6Histograms of case versus control diﬀerential expression
We plot the histogram distribution of the pvalues for each of the 4 regions shown in Figure 23 below. Each plot
below has its peak at 1.0 with a general increase across. Interestingly, the charts for cerebrospinal vs
Parkinsons and Alzheimers look similar and the charts for serum vs Parkinsons and Alzheimers are more similar.
This is signiﬁcant to note because rather than the disease being more similar across bioﬂuids, it happens to be
that the bioﬂuids are more similar across the two disorders.
Figure 22: Top 20 Expressed miRNA Heatmap for each bioﬂuid versus each disorder.Venn Diagram of Disorders
Another visualization performed is a venn diagram seen in Figure 24 below that shows overlap of miRNAs
diﬀerentially expressed between Parkinson (red) and Alzheimer (green). Majority of miRNAs are in Parkinson's
with 17 listed. There are 14 miRNAs in Alzheimer's. But between the two disorders there are 13 miRNAs shared.
Therefore, there is still a good amount of miRNA overlap between the diseases.
Figure 23: Histogram of pvalue for each bioﬂuid versus each disorder.Spearman correlations of log2 fold gene expression
A spearman correlation matrix is shown in Figure 25 which is a pairwise Spearman correlation of log2 fold gene
expression changes between each disorder and CTL in each bioﬂuid. The circle sizes are scaled to reﬂect
absolute Spearman correlations. To produce this plot we took the log2 fold gene expressions column from each
of the 4 LRT analyses we performed and then used Pandas correlation function to generate a R² Pearson
correlation number.
The striking amount of correlation is between Parkinson and Alzheimers in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid region. This is
very important as it implies that there is a signiﬁcant amount of correlation between the two disorders for this
bioﬂuid with the highest correlation of 0.30. There is also a signiﬁcant amount of correlation between
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's in the serum region with a correlation of around 0.27. There is high correlation
between the bioﬂuids and the two disorders, especially in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid region.
Figure 24: Venn Diagram showing miRNA overlap between Parkinson's and Alzheimer's in
both bioﬂuids.Volcano Plot
Figure 26 shows a volcano plot with the two disorders against the two bioﬂuid regions. Volcano plots help to
diﬀerentiate the down and up regulated miRNA sequences with respect to the control group (healthy patients). It
is worthwhile to note that when miRNAs are downregulated, this means that there is less miRNA expression -
because miRNA regulates mRNA expression, this results in more mRNA expression. mRNA, of course, dictates
what proteins are synthesized in the body. In that same vein, when miRNA are upregulated, this means that they
regulate mRNA expression at a higher rate, causing less mRNA expression. Chart (a) shows only up regulated
miRNAs. Chart (b) shows both down and up regulated miRNAs, with mostly up regulated. Chart (c) shows
mostly up regulated miRNAs with few down regulated ones as well. Finally, chart (d) shows a higher amount of
down regulated miRNAs with some up regulated ones as well.

each disorder.Additional detailed volcano plots were made to that included labels for the potentially important miRNA's. Figure
27, shows the Alzheimer vs Serum detailed Volcano plot which shows the miRNA that are upregulated and
downregulated. These miRNA's are further analysed by mapping them to the speciﬁc mRNAs that they regulate
the expression of in the following sections.
Figure 26: Volcano plot Bioﬂuid versus Disorder.Mappings
In oue ﬁnal analysis, we mapped the overlapping miRNAs of interest to their target mRNAs, and subsequently,
to the genes they encode.
When mapping certain miRNAs to the speciﬁc mRNAs that they regulate, one issue we ran into was that a
miRNA can regulate hundreds of mRNAs. This is because miRNAs only require a small amount of nucleotide
matches to be able to latch onto an mRNA and suppress its expression. Therefore, miRNAs can have many
target mRNAs. Of course, we are more interested in a small amount of relevant mRNAs, speciﬁcally those that
encode proteins involved in neurological processes. So, we chose to focus our analysis on the top 3 target
mRNAs for each miRNA, ranked in terms of the mRNA's (gene's) ""Target Rank"" and ""Target Score"", dictated by
miRDB.org. The site allowed us to search miRNA sequences for their target genes. As mentioned above, since
miRNA can have hundreds of matches, these are just a few matches, some selected because of their high
""Target Ranks"" and ""Target Scores"", and others because of past research done by scientists on the proteins'
involvement with neurological processes.
Note: The miRNA and their mappings included here are not the full list of miRNAs and their proteins. Those
included in each section are the miRNA that repressed mRNA more relevant to the disorders we are studying,
primarily encoding proteins responsible for certain brain functions.

Based on prior research, Alzheimer's disease has primarily been linked with a protein called apolipoprotein E
(APOE) . Researchers have found that the presence of this particular gene has been associated with the
formation of amyloid plaques (the presence of which we studied and incorporated into our DESeq2 model).
These protein clumps ""clog up"" the brain and lead to the death of nerve cells. Unfortunately, the mapping of the
diﬀerentially expressed miRNA in the CSF of Alzheimer's patients did not uncover this protein. Another gene
commonly linked with AD is the tau protein, which contributes to the ""tangles"" in Alzheimer's brains (we also
studied this in our analysis). In this vein, some of the genes that were found to be aﬀected by one of the up-
regulated miRNAs were tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2) and microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT). These
genes contribute to making the protein that forms the tau tangles in the brain. However, there are other proteins
that have been found to be related to the onset of Alzheimer's . One such gene was complement C3b/C4b
receptor 1 (CR1). The upregulated miRNA represses the expression of this gene, which decreases the
production of a protein in the brain that is partly responsible for controlling brain inﬂammation. The absence of
this protein can result in inﬂammation, a possible cause of Alzheimer's. Another such gene is the one that
encodes phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), which contributes to the process of
neurons communicating signals to each other and ensuring that the right communication happens in order for
the body to function properly, as well as the process of memory formation . The absence of this protein can
negatively aﬀect these processes. There are also neurological proteins that are aﬀected by the up-regulation of
miRNA. For example, the amount of neuroplastin available in the brain is aﬀected by some miRNA. Neuroplastin
is a protein that is important in neuron and synaptic functions; in other words, they are signiﬁcant in the process
of cells communicating with each other .2 7

Based on prior research, researchers have pinpointed some possible genes that, coupled with family history,
can mutate and cause Parkinson's disease . We were able to ﬁnd miRNA that aﬀected the expression of some
of these genes, and consequently the proteins that they help to create. One such gene is leucine rich repeat
kinase 2 (LRRK2). This gene encodes a protein called dardarin, which plays a big role in biological processes
that require inter-protein interaction, like the transmitting of signals between neurons or assembling a cell's
cytoskeleton (its physical framework) . Another protein found to be related to Parkinson's is parkin RBR E3
ubiquitin protein ligase (PRKN). This gene encodes the protein parkin, which helps in the cell by tagging
unneeded proteins with markers called ubiquitin. This lets other parts of the cell know that those proteins are
unneeded, so they are properly disposed in structures called proteasomes. With the absence of parkin, this
system is compromised, and the build-up of unnecessary proteins may lead to issues that cause physical
movement and balance problems associated with PD. The failure of the ubiquitin-proteasome system can also
aﬀect normal cell activities and the cells themselves, speciﬁcally those that produce dopamine. Decrease of
dopamine production is a tell-tale sign of Parkinson's . One neurologically-related protein that we found to be
aﬀected by miRNA expression was neuroﬁlament medium (NEFM). The neuroﬁlament medium protein encodes
the protein neuroﬁlament, which is used by cells to mark neurons that are damaged. If this system is aﬀected,
there would be no way to distinguish between working and damaged neurons, gravely aﬀecting neuronal
activity .3 0

As mentioned above when inspecting Alzheimer's samples from CSF, researchers have already pinpointed some
genes that have a likely connection with Alzheimer's. One of these genes is the triggering receptor expressed on
myeloid cells 1 (TREM1). Receptors on myeloid cells are responsible for controlling inﬂammation and
neurological development . Inﬂammation, especially in the brain, as mentioned earlier, is a tell-tale sign of
Alzheimer's. Clusterin (CLU) is a gene that helps to regulate amyloid-beta amounts in the brain - these, as we
know, make up the plaque structures that are found in Alzheimer's brains. An imbalance in the production and
movement of amyloid-beta is then crucial to the development of Alzheimer's . Another such gene is sortilin
related receptor 1 (SORL1). SORL1 is a gene that is involved in the production of amyloid-beta peptides, which
are the same plaque structures that are found in the brain of Alzheimer's patients . There were also
neurologically-related genes that were found to be aﬀected by the diﬀerentially expressed miRNA. For example,
the count of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was found to be decreased by an up-regulated miRNA.
The BDNF protein is largely responsible for promoting the growth of and dealing with the maintenance of nerve
cells . One target gene of many miRNA in this group was neuregulin 3 (NRG3), which is a group of signaling
proteins that helps to oversee cellular functions of neuronal systems, like survival, proliferation, and
diﬀerentiation of nerve cells . Neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1) is another gene that was aﬀected by miRNA. The
miRNA that targeted NP1 was actually found to be down-regulated, which increases the production of NP1;
NP1 is involved in the process of inducing neuronal cell death, and a surplus of NP1 could result in more
neurons being destroyed prematurely .3 4

In this group of data/results, something that stood out was the overlap of many proteins with the Alzheimer's in
serum group, as well as the two CSF groups. Proteins like neuroﬁlament, neuregulin, BDNF, and neuronal
growth regulators have been aﬀected by up- and down-regulated miRNAs in both the CSF and serum groups
for the two disease conditions. One new protein that seems to be related to Parkinson's and serum speciﬁcally,
though, is neurocalcin delta (NCALD). A decrease in NCALD has been shown to protect against spinal muscular
atrophy, a symptom tangentially related to the symptoms of Parkinson's . Another target protein that has also
been pinpointed by researchers in the past to be connected to Parkinson's is synuclein alpha (SNCA). This is
one of the most common proteins linked to Parkinson's - mutations of this protein can disrupt cell homeostasis
and neuron death .3 9

We found that the overlapping miRNA that are diﬀerentially expressed are all up-regulated, meaning that they
restrict the amounts of the target proteins listed above. These overlapping miRNA are the central focus of our
research project. We have discussed the importance of many of these genes in the previous sections for the
individual conditions and data sources, and the neural functions that they contribute are all aﬀected in the
development of both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Speciﬁcally for Alzheimer's, for example, clusterin
helps to regulate the processing of amyloid-beta structures, which make up plaques in Alzheimer's brains.
Another Alzheimer's-focused gene is TREM1, which encodes receptors on myeloid cells. These receptors are
responsible for controlling brain inﬂammation, which is a tell-tale sign of Alzheimer's. Speciﬁcally for
Parkinson's, LRRK1 plays a big role in biological processes that require inter-protein interaction, like the
transmitting of signals between neurons - the repression of this gene can play a big factor in the movement
problems of Parkinson's patients. What is most interesting, however, are the overlapping miRNA that seem to
aﬀect both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease patients, particularly their brains. The decrease in the amounts
of the following proteins can aﬀect the brain function of those aﬀected. For example, neuroﬁlament medium
encodes neuroﬁlament, the protein that is used by cells to mark neurons that are damaged. Neuroplastin is a
protein that is important in neuron and synaptic functions. Neurocalcin delta has been shown to protect against
spinal muscular atrophy, a symptom tangentially related to the symptoms of Parkinson's. It has also been linked
with the creation of neurons in the hippocampus of adults, which is the part of the brain that is responsible for
memory. This, of course, is negatively aﬀected in those with Alzheimer's. The BDNF protein is largelyresponsible for promoting the growth of and dealing with the maintenance of nerve cells. Finally, neuregulin 3
(NRG3), which is a group of signaling proteins that helps to oversee cellular functions of neuronal systems, like
survival, proliferation, and diﬀerentiation of nerve cells.
Conclusion
Our goal for this study was to ﬁnd genetic overlapping in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's in order to guide future
research with key miRNA that are present in both diseases. We identiﬁed 13 up and down-regulated miRNAs in
the CSF of Alzheimer's patients, 10 up and down-regulated miRNAs in the CSF of Parkinson's patients, 14 up
and down-regulated miRNAs in the serum of Alzheimer's patients, and 22 up and down-regulated miRNAs in
the serum of Parkinson's patients. From those, we identiﬁed 13 miRNAs that were shared between the diseases
and between the bioﬂuids. We mapped all the up-regulated, down-regulated and overlapping miRNAs to the top
3 target mRNAs that they are binding to (ranked in terms of the mRNA's (gene's) ""Target Rank"" and ""Target
Score""). As stated, however, these top 3 mRNAs are not necessarily relevant to our studies of brain disorders,
so we also identiﬁed mRNAs that were tangentially related to neural functions. With careful analysis we
discovered that the overlapping miRNA's were all up-regulated, meaning the miRNAs are restricting the
amounts of target proteins that we found to be produced at lower amounts.
The important target proteins we have found in Alzheimer's are:
clusterin (CLU) 
triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM1) 
microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) 
These have all been linked as key to Alzheimer's Disease by previous studies.
The important target protein we have found in Parkinson's is:
leucine rich repeat kinase 1 (LRRK1) 
This has been linked as key to Parkinson's Disease by previous studies.
However, the most signiﬁcant proteins we have found are listed below, these have not to our knowledge been
identiﬁed yet in other studies. These are common to both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases:
neuroﬁlament medium (NEFM)
neuroplastin (NPTN)
neurocalcin delta (NCALD)
brain derived neurotrophic factor (BNDF)
neuregulin (NRG3)
We hope that these signiﬁcant proteins that we found as genetically overlapped in the cerebrospinal and serum
bioﬂuid regions will help future researchers and scientists to gain a better understanding at how these two
diseases are linked and that future progress can be made in order to target these proteins to inhibit or lessen the
eﬀects of both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases.2 6

Project Targets
Running the project
• To install the dependencies, run the following command from the root directory of the project: 
pip install -r requirements.txt  
target: data
• To process the data, from the root project directory run the command:
python3 run.py data  
• The data pipeline step takes the .fastq compressed ﬁles as input and then applies two transformations:
process and align
• This pipeline step also uses an additional CSV ﬁle that is the SRA run database, a sample looks like as follows:
Run expired_age    CONDITION    BIOFLUID      
SRR1568567  40  Parkinson's Disease Cerebrospinal  
• The conﬁguration ﬁles for the data step are stored in conﬁg/data-params.json. These include the parameters
for the tools as well as the directories used for storing the raw, temporary and output ﬁles.
""raw_data_directory"": ""./data/raw"",  
""tmp_data_directory"": ""./data/tmp"",  
""out_data_directory"": ""./data/out"",  
• The conﬁguration also includes an attribute to the SRA run input database (described above), and an attribute
of where to store that in the data folder. Additional ﬁlter attributes are included for ease of use to avoid
processing all patients, if this ﬁlter_enable is set it will only process a subset of SRA rows (ﬁlter_start_row to
ﬁlter_start_row + ﬁlter_num_rows).""sra_runs"" : {  
   ""input_database"" : ""/datasets/SRP046292/exRNA_Atlas_CORE_Results.csv"",  
   ""input_database2"" : ""/datasets/SRP046292/SraRunTable.csv"",  
   ""input_database3"" : ""/datasets/SRP046292/Table_S1.csv"",  
   ""output_database"" : ""data/raw/exRNA_Atlas_CORE_Results.csv"",  
   ""filter_enable"" : 0,  
   ""filter_start_row"" : 120,  
   ""filter_num_rows"" : 10    
}, 
• An optional transformation of the data is ""process"" that uses the following data conﬁguration below that will
invoke cutadapt which ﬁnds and remove adapter sequences. The attributes include the adapters (r1 and r2) to
identify the start and end of pairs are a JSON array. The attribute enable allows to disable this cleaning step,
instead it will simply copy the paired ﬁles from the source dataset. The arguments attribute allows ﬂexible
setting of any additional attribute to the cutadapt process. Finally, we have two wildcard paths that indicate the
location of the SRA fastq pair ﬁles (fastq1 and fastq2).
""process"" : {  
   ""enable"" : 1,  
   ""tool"" : ""/opt/conda/bin/cutadapt"",  
   ""r1_adapters"" : [""AAAAA"", ""GGGG""],  
   ""r2_adapters"" : [""CCCCC"", ""TTTT""],  
   ""arguments"" : ""--pair-adapters --cores=4"",  
   ""fastq1_path"" : ""/datasets/srp073813/%run_1.fastq.gz"",  
   ""fastq2_path"" : ""/datasets/srp073813/%run_2.fastq.gz""  
}, 
• The second transformation of the data is ""aligncount"" that can be set to either use download, STAR or Kallisto.
The choice is controlled by the aligncount attribute:
""aligncount"" : ""download"",  
• download step will use the ftp location of the gzip ﬁle in the Sra table and download using the curl command
and unzips and extracts the readCounts_gencode_sense.txt which represents the gene counts for the sample.
""download"" : {  
   ""enable"" : 1,  
   ""tool"" : ""curl"",  
   ""arguments"" : ""-L -R"",  
   ""read_counts_file"" : ""readCounts_gencode_sense.txt""  
}, 
• kallisto uses the index_ﬁle attribute, the location of the directory of the reference genome, which for this
replication project was GRCh37_E75. The arguments attribute allows ﬂexible setting of any additional attribute
to the kallisto process. Including the bootstrap samples.The attribute enable allows to disable this alignmentstep, this is useful for debugging the process prior step, for example, you can run quality checks on the
processed fastq ﬁles before proceeding to alignment.
""kallisto"" : {  
   ""enable"" : 1,  
   ""tool"" : ""/opt/kallisto_linux-v0.42.4/kallisto"",  
   ""index_file"" : ""/datasets/srp073813/reference/kallisto_transcripts.idx"",  
   ""arguments"" : ""quant -b 8 -t 8""  
}, 
• STAR uses the gene_path attribute is the location of the directory of the reference genome, which for this
replication project was GRCh37_E75 as described in the reference_gene attribute. The arguments attribute
allows ﬂexible setting of any additional attribute to the STAR process. Including TranscriptomeSAM in the
quantMode arguments will also output bam ﬁles. Additionally, the log ﬁle gets outputted which has PRUA
(percentage of reads uniquely aligned). The attribute enable allows to disable this alignment step, this is useful
for debugging the process prior step, for example, you can run quality checks on the processed fastq ﬁles
before proceeding to alignment.
""STAR"" : {  
   ""enable"" : 1,  
   ""tool"" : ""/opt/STAR-2.5.2b/bin/Linux_x86_64_static/STAR"",  
   ""reference_gene"" : ""GRCh37_E75"",  
   ""gene_path"" : ""/path/to/genomeDir"",  
   ""arguments"" : ""--runMode alignReads --quantMode GeneCounts --genomeLoad
LoadAndKeep --readFilesCommand zcat --runThreadN 8""  
}, 
• The process and align transformation work on each of the samples. After each sample iteration, the temporary
fastq ﬁles will be deleted to reduce storage requirements.

target: merge
• To merge gene count and/or BAM ﬁles generated from the data target, from the root project directory run the
command:
python3 run.py merge  
• The conﬁguration ﬁles for the data step are stored in conﬁg/count-params.json. These include the parameters
for the count merge and bam merge and it's associated arguments.
• The format attribute informs if to process download, kallisto (or STAR) ﬁles. The gene counts are merged into a
TSV ﬁle and as well as a feature table based on the SRA run table. Additional STAR attributes in the JSON allow
you to specify skiprows used when processing the gene count ﬁles as well as identifying the column from thegene matrix ﬁle to use as the column used to. There is an additional imputes attribute that allows you to impute
any column with missing data. The attributes also include an optional ""ﬁlter_names"" gene table used to remove
genes as well as removing false-positive genes. Finally, we can rename the feature columns before we save out
the feature table.

target: normalize
• To normalize the aligned merge counts, from the root project directory run the command:
python3 run.py normalize  
• The conﬁguration ﬁles for the data step are stored in conﬁg/normalize-params.json.
• We use a custom R script which uses the DESeq2 module to take the input merged gene counts and the
experiment features and outputs two normalized counts ﬁles. The analysis is done for all samples in the SRA run
table. The output_dir sets the output location for the normalized count matrix ﬁles. One ﬁle is the standard
normalized counts using the DESeq2 module, and the second normalized count ﬁle is after a Variable
Stabilization Transform (LRT). We also have a ""max_genes"" attribute that will ﬁlter the genes and removes ones
that have little to no variance across disorder versus control.
• The data JSON conﬁguration ﬁle also holds an array of samples, a sample looks like as follows:
{ 
   ""output_dir"" : ""data/out"",  
   ""DESeq2"" : {

• To perform the analysis for the gene counts, from the root project directory run the command:
python3 run.py analysis  
• The conﬁguration ﬁles for the data step are stored in conﬁg/analysis-params.json.
• We use a custom R script which uses the DESeq2 module to take the input merged gene counts and the
experiment features and outputs 2 sets of ﬁles for each bioﬂuid region. Each bioﬂuid region will compare a
disorder versus Control. This will result in a total of 4 sets of ﬁles (2 bioﬂuid regions x 2 disorder pair
comparisons). Each output set includes a Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) using the full and reduced model as
speciﬁed in the attributes below as well as a MA-Plot and Heatmap. The additional attributes include the
property of doing parallel processing for DESeq2.

We chose four brain regions(Frontal, Temporal, Hippocampal, and Entorhinal) and plotted the distributions of
plaques and tangles of all three groups respectively.
Supplementary Figure 1: Distributions of reads and transcriptome genome ratio.Supplementary Figure 2: Tangle counts in each brain region.The plots above show that the distribution of tangles and plaques of AD group is diﬀerent to other groups as
expected. However, the diﬀerence between PD and healthy control is not signiﬁcant.
Distributions of the overlapping miRNA Sequences
Below shows the distributions of the overlapping miRNA sequences. It is clear that the distributions of these
sequences are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between AD and PD groups in CSF samples.
Supplementary Figure 3: Plaque counts in each brain region.Correlation between signiﬁcantly regulated miRNA and numerical features
The plots below show the correlation between the signiﬁcantly regulated miRNA found in the volcano plots
above and the basic numerical features we used in the DESeq model.
It appears that most of the up-regulated sequences in Cerebrospinal ﬂuid of the Alzheimer's Disease group are
weakly positively correlated with these numerical features, especially with PlaqueTotal , TangleTotal , 
Braak score , and sn_depigmentation . And the sequences in Serum of the Parkinson's Disease group
are mostly negatively correlated. However, the correlations with numerical features are not particularly strong.

[40] Stefanis, Leonidas. “α-Synuclein in Parkinson's Disease.” Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine, vol.","This study aimed to identify gene expression similarities and differences between Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) patients by analyzing microRNA (miRNA) sequences in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood serum (SER). The researchers sought to improve understanding of AD and PD development, potentially aiding early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. They used sequencing data from miRNAs to study the genetic causes underlying these diseases.

The researchers found that AD is a progressive brain disorder that deteriorates memory and thinking skills, while PD is a progressive nervous system disorder affecting movement. Both diseases are age-related and have genetic risk factors, such as variations in the APOE e4 gene for AD.

The study involved extracting miRNA from CSF and SER, which are part of the central nervous system affected by both disorders. The researchers created a pipeline to process data, perform quality checks, merge gene count files into a matrix, normalize counts using DESeq2 module for analysis, visualize results through various plots like MA Plots and Heatmaps, and conduct quality checks using tools like Cutadapt and FastQC.

Quality checks revealed some samples failed ERCC QC standards due to reasons like abnormal amounts of unspecified bases. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) showed differences in plaque density and Braak Score among patients with different conditions.

The analysis generated LRT plots comparing models with or without the disorder variable. Visualizations included charts showing differentially expressed miRNAs between conditions. The Venn diagram showed overlap between miRNAs expressed in both AD and PD patients.

Finally, the researchers mapped overlapping miRNAs to their target mRNAs to identify proteins potentially contributing to symptoms or development of both diseases. They concluded that specific upregulated miRNAs restrict protein amounts related to neurological functions common in both AD and PD patients. This finding could guide future research on these diseases' shared genetic aspects."

ABSTRACT - In the past year there has been a
huge increase in video streaming activity. More people
are streaming live lectures, sports, news, and video
calls via the internet at home today than we have
ever seen before. There is also a huge increase in
live streaming, as content creators have been forced
to share their talents virtually. With this huge demand
for internet video content, Internet Service Providers
(ISPs) need to be able to keep up with the trends and
understand video content delivery to help troubleshoot
efﬁciently. However, in the wake of data breaches and
privacy concerns many users choose to use a virtual
private network (VPN) to surf the web. This means
network data is encrypted, and ISP’s are not able to
properly understand user trafﬁc. As a solution, we
have created a classiﬁer that can correctly predict if
a user is streaming live video or video on demand.
Using statistical analysis of encrypted video data and
machine learning techniques, we were able to create a
model that is more than 97% accurate. This is very
useful in determining how different forms of video
are delivered to users, which can ultimately help ISP’s
pinpoint network issues and enhance user experience.
I.INTRODUCTION
Due to the variety, affordability and convenience
of online video streaming, there are more subscribers
than ever to video streaming platforms. Moreover, the
decreased operation of non-essential businesses and
increase in the number of people working from home in
this past year has further compounded this effect. More
people are streaming live lectures, sports, news, and
video calls via the internet at home today than we have
ever seen before. In March 2020, Youtube saw a 2.5x
increase in the amount of time people spent streaming
live video [1]. Twitch more than doubled their hours of
content in three months after the start of the pandemic
[1]. There is a huge boom in the video content world,
and it does not seem to be slowing down anytime soon.
Internet Service Providers, such as Viasat, are tasked
with optimizing internet connections and tailoring theirallocation of resources to ﬁt each unique customer’s
needs. With this increase in internet activity, it would
be especially beneﬁcial for Viasat to understand what
issues arise when customers stream various forms of
video. When a user has difﬁculties with their internet
connections, ISP’s want to be able to understand their
activity to give potential reasons to why the problem
occurred and a quick solution.
Although we are able to identify the genre of
an activity when a user is not using a VPN, the
challenge arises when a user chooses to surf the web
through a VPN. When it comes to VPN use cases
we can’t identify a user’s unique activity when they
experience issues, thus making us unable to success-
fully troubleshoot those problems. Different forms of
video streaming require different network resources for
optimal experience, thus understanding how video is
delivered could be especially handy. For example, if a
customer watches a lot of live video they may prefer a
connection with lower latency. A live stream requires
low latency in order for the streamer and audience to
communicate in real time without a signiﬁcant lag.
As latency increases, the delay in time between the
audience receiving the video from the streamer (lag)
increases. However, for V oD high latency is acceptable
since an inﬂux of packets can be stored or paused for
longer and take a backburner on the network without a
user noticing a change in video quality. This is where
a tool that could identify various internet activities,
speciﬁcally live or video on demand (V oD) streaming,
within a VPN tunnel would be extremely useful for an
Internet Service Provider.
Previously, there have been effective ways to dis-
tinguish video streaming from general internet activity,
yet distinguishing between different types of video is
a little more challenging.1User’s experience both live
video and V oD in the same way over the internet; users
can play videos while the video platforms send the
proceeding content making the video stream smooth
with minor buffers. However, live video has a few
components that V oD does not. Some live videos havean interactive component where the audience can com-
municate with the streamer in real time. Live streams
also do not have quality controls, where users can set
the quality of the video to a certain level. Our goal
is to distinguish how providers send live video vs. pre-
uploaded videos (V oD) to their users. Other works have
successfully achieved classifying the two types of video
by looking at the payloads of packets, however their
methods do not work with encrypted VPN data since
we are unable to see the raw data within packets [2].
Although we cannot see the contents of the pack-
ets transported across a network, patterns in the way
they are sent can still help us identify if a user is
streaming a live or pre-uploaded video. Our task is
to detect key differences between the way information
is sent across a network for live video streaming and
V oD. To achieve this, we have generated an extensive
data set consisting of network data for both types of
video content. To create the data, we used a tool that
connects to our own interfaces and captures consistent
real time internet trafﬁc from our personal devices. We
have chosen to generate network data from platforms
that offer both live and V oD content, such as Youtube
and Twitch, as well as data from platforms such as
Netﬂix, Facebook Live, Radio.com, Amazon Prime,
Hulu, and Zoom (live video calls) and more. Through
an extensive dataset drawing from multiple providers
we were able to create a robust model that can identify
when a user is streaming a V oD or a live video. This
model is meant to be used in conjunction with another
pipeline that can ﬁrst verify that video streaming is
occurring within a VPN tunnel. Using our ﬁndings,
we can further classify what type of video a user is
streaming, to help gain a better understanding of user
activity to ultimately enhance user experience.
II.DATASET
The dataset of our project is generated using
csv ﬁles from our google drive folder. Each csv ﬁle
represents a ﬁve-minutes long recorded network trafﬁc
using network-stats tool provided by the Viasat.2Below
is one of example of a row generated using this tool.
Below is the description of each column of a ﬁle.
For the whole dataset, we have collected 556 ﬁve
minute data chunks in total. The dataset is balanced
with 278 V oD data and 278 Live Streaming data.
Below is the breakdown of sources for all the data
(streaming data is videos on demand).
III.METHODS
The internet data that we have collected consists
of the number of packets and bytes uploaded and
downloaded across a connection. A connection consists
of the source and destination IP addresses and ports.
Using this data, we can look at the ﬂow of packets
and bytes sent back and forth over time between the
user and destination.With this information, and lots of
exploratory data analysis we were able to ﬁnd some
key identiﬁers that can help us distinguish what type
of video is being played.
Similar to other common approaches to analyze
internet network data, we have chosen to look for sta-
tistical differences between the ﬂow of packets across anetwork for live video streaming and V oD. The graphs
below look at the number of bytes downloaded across
a network over time for ﬁve minute chunks of both
Twitch live and Twitch uploaded videos.
First, it is important to note that both graphs
follow patterns we typically see for video streaming
within a VPN, thus we can verify the data we are
looking at is useful and correct. Video streaming data
can be identiﬁed by patterns of consistent data being
transferred across a network like we see in the graphs
above. General internet trafﬁc has a more sporadic and
unpredictable looking plot. When looking at the graphs
above a few differences are immediately apparent. First,
we can see that the live video has a denser plot with
bytes being downloaded in more frequently. On the
other hand, the V oD has more time between each spike
but the magnitude of packets coming in at a time is
larger. To quantify this key difference, we can take the
ratio of time packets that are being sent to the time
packets that are not being sent (packet size is 0).3This
will tell us how much time during the viewing of the
video no packets were being sent from the destination
to the user, which is larger for V oD compared to live
video viewing. This is because since a V oD is pre-
uploaded, providers can send larger chunks of video
content to their users, whereas for live video streams
providers send content to user’s as they receive it in
real time.
Visually, we can note that there are a tremendous
amount of spikes in the live video data compared to the
V oD. To quantify this difference, we can simply look
at the count of spikes in bytes being downloaded for a
ﬁve minute chunk of video. The graphs below highlight
where each spike is, and we classify a ‘spike’ and peak
in the data using the mean number of bytes downloaded
as a lower bound. Using this lower bound can help us
ﬁlter out any noise that can be present when collecting
network data at lower magnitudes.4
It is clear that Live video has a much larger num-
ber of spikes than the VOD. In this speciﬁc example
live video has over ﬁve times as many peaks present.
Another way to quantify this density in peaks is to look
at how far apart spikes are from each other. Below we
can see a graph that plots what time each spike occurs
for VOD and Live Video in a span of 300 seconds.
As we can see, the peaks for live video are much
closer together than those for V oD. Each peak is about
10 seconds apart for V oD, whereas peaks for live videos
are very frequent. It is important to note that there are
many micro spikes that can’t always be observed when
looking at the main plot of bytes downloaded over a
network (ﬁgure 1), which could taint the valid packet
rate. For example, a noisy V oD data ﬁle may have
many small packet transactions, resulting in the ratio
of valid packets transferred to be as high as the live
video streaming. Looking at the time intervals between
peaks helps eliminate this possible error, since we are
ﬁltering out the smaller spikes.5
With live vs VOD being visually different when
looking at the Byte Counts, we decided to further
our analysis by exploring the extended columns within
our datasets. These extended columns such as Packet
Sizes were provided to us through our data collection
method, that could potentially give more in depthinformation about the data we are working with. By
binning Packet Sizes in 200 millisecond intervals,
we were able to discover a new angle in which to
analyze the datasets in the time domain. The graph
below shows Twitch V oD vs Twitch Live, with Packet
Sizes being signiﬁcantly larger for V oD than for Live.
With further analysis, we could also see that the
V oD data has larger spikes of Packet Sizes and large
increments of nearly no Packet Sizes being transferred
while the Live data always has Packet Sizes being
transferred. The red line in the graphs above are at
a 0.01 threshold, and from this we can infer that a
possible feature is in the works just by looking at how
many Packet Sizes are below that threshold.6
After binning in 200 millisecond intervals, we
wanted to look at the data we had in the frequency
domain to see if we can ﬁnd any further information
present for Packet Sizes. By using Welch’s Method9,
we were able to transform the data to the frequency
domain. The graphs below show the difference
between V oD and Live, with peaks being signiﬁcantly
larger in V oD in comparison to the Live data.
The differences between these large peaks and
troughs led us to believe that the height between them
is a viable feature that we could use in our model.6As
well, the frequency domain showed us that peaks are
occurring at very speciﬁc intervals between both V oD
and Live. Every increment of 0.1Hz and 0.2Hz, the
peaks for V oD were following a consistent downward
trend while Live peaks spiked and fell in a veryconsistent linear trend. These Hz values showed enough
of a difference between VOD and Live that we decided
to ﬁnd the minimum 0.1Hz8and 0.2Hz9values
present in each dataset and normalize them to create
two new features, with streaming on average having
larger values than live.
With all of our analysis, we were able to ﬁnd key
features that would beneﬁt our model. Typically, VOD
has more leisure time and live streaming has less. Live
streaming requires video providers to consistently send
data to their users as they are sending it in real time:
this is a key difference in the way live streaming vs.
VOD is delivered to viewers.
IV.MODEL
Using the features we have extracted, we then
fed them through various supervised machine learning
models to predict if live video or V oD streaming is
occurring within a VPN tunnel. We trained each model
with 80% of our data (446 datasets), and tested it with
20% (112 datasets). The data used for training/testing
was decided randomly, to ensure a representative sam-
ple of platforms and classes (live vs V oD). The models
we looked at are as follows:
A. SVM(Support-Vector Machine)
Support-vector machines is a supervised learning
model with associated learning algorithms that analyze
data for classiﬁcation and regression analysis. It will
construct a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in a
high- or inﬁnite-dimensional space for further classiﬁ-
cation. For this speciﬁc project, we have passed scaled
features11value into the SVM classiﬁer, this model has
an accuracy of around 76%.
B. Linear SVM(Support-Vector Machine)
Similar to SVM classiﬁer above but use linear as
kernel type instead. It means that lines will be used to
classify each feature to two classes in each dimension.
This model has an accuracy of 88%.
C. Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is one of the most commonly
used machine learning algorithms for classiﬁcation. It
is a reliable predictor for the two classes classiﬁcation
problem we have. After passing all our features into it,
the model has an 89% accuracy.
D. KNeighbors
K-NN is a type of classiﬁcation that relies on
distance for classiﬁcation. For classiﬁcation, a useful
technique is used to assign weights to the contributions
of the neighbors, so that the nearer neighbors contribute
more to the average than the more distant ones. For thisproject, we have used a K-NN classiﬁer which takes 3
nearest neighbors for classiﬁcation. This model has an
accuracy of 96%.
E. Random Forest
Random forests is an ensemble learning method
for classiﬁcation that operates by constructing a multi-
tude of decision trees at training time and outputting the
class that is the mode of the classes (classiﬁcation) or
mean/average prediction (regression) of the individual
trees. Random decision forests correct for decision
trees’ habit of overﬁtting to their training set. Normally,
it will outperform the normal decision tree model which
is the main reason we used it for our project. Following
is the importance of each feature returned by the
random forest model. The accuracy of this model is
97%.
V.Results
A. Trained Binary Classiﬁer
For the training process, we have randomly split
20 percent of our dataset for the validation set. For each
of the classiﬁers, we used 80 percent of the data ﬁles
to train our model and used the rest for model testing
purposes.
B. Model Selection
Below is the accuracy of each classiﬁer on the
validation set.
We can observe from above that Random Forest
Classiﬁer has the best accuracy. By this, our model is
trained using Random Forest Classiﬁer.
VI.Discussion
The most powerful model we tried is Random
Forest, and this is the model we chose to output forour project. With a high accuracy score of 97%, the
model generalizes very well compared to others. The
confusion matrix for the model can be seen below:
Out of over 100 test data ﬁles, only 3 ﬁles
were inaccurately classiﬁed with the wrong class label.
The model has high accuracy, precision, recall and
F1 scores, proving it to be robust and correct. It is
also important to note that although this is the best
model, the other models were able to achieve high
accuracy scores as well. This shows that the features
we chose to extract are very telling of how live video
and V oD is delivered to users. We can also see that
there are very dramatic differences in the way these
two types of video content are sent, helping us achieve
creating a strong model that is robust and generalizable.
With this information, ISP’s can use our model in
conjunction with others to get a better understanding of
user streaming patterns and ultimately improve overall
experience.
VII. Further Work
As the project is ﬁnished, we are thinking about
what further steps we can take to perfect our project,
which includes improving the project’s comprehensive-
ness, effectiveness and ease of use. In the future, we
will possibly cover more user scenarios to make the
project more comprehensive, such as still image video
versus action videos, high resolution video versus, low
resolution video. Moreover, we can expand our project
beyond video streaming, by exploring use cases like
gaming, music streaming, video streaming etc. These
added cases can hugely increase the usability and
ﬂexibility of our algorithm to reach out for a bigger
market and to beneﬁt users of different types.
As we think about these further steps, it is im-
portant to keep data ethics and privacy in mind. In thewake of data breaches and privacy concerns, VPNs are
more popular today than ever before due to privacy
concerns of users [4]. Although it is justiﬁable for ISP’s
to understand user trafﬁc, by being able to identify
game and music streams, to optimize connections and
tailor services to their customer’s needs, there is a
limit. [5] The lengths we take to unravel the decryption
procedure by VPN’s could start to make user’s uncom-
fortable, and must always be considered before we look
at user data.
Regarding the effectiveness, we would want to cut
down the size of the data chunks needed for our training
and prediction. The smaller chunks of trafﬁc data will
simplify the data collection and training process while
improving the user experience of the model. On one
hand, users and us can spend less hours collecting
data; on the other hand, our analysis can be more
precise because smaller chunks of trafﬁc data can
represent more variations within the trafﬁc. In addition,
we will automate the pipeline for data collection,
analysis, model selection and prediction to improve the
efﬁciency. In the end, in order for general users to use
our algorithm easily and for clearer presentation, we
will embed our algorithm to a website or software so
that it could be explicitly used by more people.
Traditional internet trafﬁc investigations such
as studying packet payloads are still very common
amongst many companies, which is very ineffective.
Due to the increasing amount of personal internet data
and the popularization of the VPN, these traditional
methods are hindered. Even if the methods work, the
efﬁciency is worse compared to the ML algorithm
and the user’s privacy is less protected. Therefore, we
support these companies to keep up with the trend to
update their back end services and incorporate ML into
their algorithms. This will eventually save them time
and energy, hence bringing more efﬁciency to their
services as well as higher user satisfaction.
In the end, the possible use case for our projects
would be focused on companies like ISPs and VPN
providers. Firstly, these companies have the ability to
collect user data due to the nature of their services.
Secondly, they have the pressing need to investigate
user’s data, at the same time respect users’ privacy, in
order to provide better internet services and ultimately
enhance user experience.

A. Related Works
1) We have found some studies similar to our
project. The ﬁrst one comes from Shuval Po-
lacheck’s “Online Classiﬁcation of V oD and Live
Video Streaming Applications”[7]. In his re-
search, he found out that there are two ways to
classify V oD and Live Streaming. The ﬁrst way
is to classify use downlink average packets size
and the second way is to compare average time
difference between similar packets since video
streaming data usually has larger information
offset and live streaming data usually has smaller
information offset. Similar to his research, we
also tried to classify these two data types using
features both from time domain and frequency
domain. Also, our model outperformed his modeldue to the fact that we have extracted more
features into the training process. The second
research similar to us is the “Comparison of
machine-learning algorithms for classiﬁcation of
VPN network trafﬁc ﬂow using time-related fea-
tures”[8]. In this paper, the authors state that
useful time-related features are in the picture
below.
We have extracted some features in the time
domain similar to their ﬁndings like the feature
“Packet Zeros” which returns the number of
empty packets which relates to the time a ﬂow is
going idle. For the third research paper, we have
“Deep learning-based real-time VPN encrypted
trafﬁc identiﬁcation methods”[9]. The authors of
this paper suggest there are two deep-learning
based models which can be used for research
encrypted data. The ﬁrst one is convolutional
Auto-Encoding (CAE) and the second one is
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). However,
our random forest classiﬁer works perfectly with
around 97 percent accuracy. By this, we haven’t
applied deep learning methods in our project for
potential waste of resources.

ated: https://github.com/Viasat/network-stats
C. Features
3) Valid Packet Rate - this feature ﬁnds the ratio of
time that there is a valid packet being sent within
the 5 minute chunk of video. This is created by
grouping the data by the time column, to count
the number of valid packets (packet size > 0)
that are downloaded in the 2->1Bytes column
in the ﬁve minute chunk of video. Then,this
is calculated by dividing the number of valid
packets with the total time.
4) Number of Peaks - This feature ﬁnds the number
of peaks that are greater than the mean of the
2 ->1 Bytes columns. It is calculated by the
ﬁnd_peaks method from the scipy library.5) Interval gaps - This feature looks at the total
length of intervals between the peaks of the
spikes in the 2 ->1 Bytes column. The peak
of spikes is deﬁned when the value is greater
than the mean of the 2 ->1 Bytes column. And
then, by subtracting the time difference between
peaks, the length of intervals between peaks is
calculated. Then, by summing the lengths of
intervals, the total interval gaps are found.
6) Packet Zeros - This feature ﬁnds the percentage
of packets that are zero (below the 0.01
threshold), with the % being the value returned
per dataset. It is calculated by ﬁnding the total
number of packets below the 0.01 threshold
in the 2->1 direction multiplied by 100 then
divided by the length of the binned 200 ms
intervals.
7) Max Prominence / Mean - This feature looks at
the dataset in the frequency domain, then ﬁnds
the maximum height present between a peak
and trough and normalizes it. This normalized
comparison is done in the 2->1 direction, and
is calculated by binning the 2->1Packet Sizes
into 200 millisecond intervals, applying Welch’s
method to transform the data to the frequency
domain, and then using a ﬁnd peaks method
to ﬁnd the max prominence present in the dataset.
8) peak_0.1Hz_norm - This feature grabs the
minimum .1Hz value found within the
transformed data in the frequency domain
and normalizes it. This spectral feature is
calculated by binning the 2->1Packet Sizes into
200 millisecond intervals, and applies Welch’s
method to transform the data to the frequency
domain before looking at all the values occurring
every 0.1Hz to ﬁnd the minimum.
9) peak_0.2Hz_norm - This feature grabs the
minimum .2Hz value found within the
transformed data in the frequency domain
and normalizes it. This spectral feature is
calculated by binning the 2->1Packet Sizes into
200 millisecond intervals, and applies Welch’s
method to transform the data to the frequency
domain before looking at all the values occurring
every 0.2Hz to ﬁnd the minimum.D. Documentation
10) Welch’s Method - Welch’s method computes an
estimate of the power spectral density by dividing
the data into overlapping segments, computing
a modiﬁed periodogram for each segment and
averaging the periodograms. This description
is pulled from https://docs.scipy.
org/doc/scipy/reference/generate\
\d/scipy.signal.welch.html and it
explains how we use Welch’s method to estimate
the power spectral density which converts the
data we have to the frequency domain.

considerably.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Typically,
low
latency
and
high
bandwidth
results
in
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
smoother
user
experience
and
is
considered
to
be
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
‘good’
network
condition.
High
latency
and
low
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bandwidth
are
typically
considered
‘poor’
network
 
 
 
 
 
 
conditions.
 
Internet
Service
Providers
(ISPs)
analyze
network
 
 
 
 
 
 
traffic
to
discern
the
performance
their
customers
are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
achieving
and
to
better
understand
how
their
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
customers
prefer
to
use
the
web.
Traffic
classification
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is
a
specific
branch
of
network
traffic
analysis
which
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
aims
to
categorize
a
set
of
network
traffic
into
the
class
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
user
behavior
or
application
which
generated
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
packets.
Traffic
classification
can
be
leveraged
by
ISPs
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
optimize
and
improve
their
services,
such
as
by
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
prioritizing
a
low-latency
connection
for
a
customer
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
they
recognize
as
engaging
in
video-conferencing.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Traffic
classification
may
examine
packet-level
 
 
 
 
 
information
such
as
the
source
and
destination
IP
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
addresses,
the
application
protocol
number,
and
even
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
payload
data
itself
to
perform
classification.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However,
with
the
advent
of
encrypted
protocols
like
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HTTPS
and
with
recent
widespread
user
adoption
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
virtual
private
networks
(VPNs),
these
features
are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
obscured
or
obfuscated
via
encryption
[1].
Encrypted
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
traffic
classification
is
an
area
of
research
which
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
utilizes
statistical
features
of
traffic
flows
to
perform
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
traffic
classification
even
when
the
individual
packet
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
contents
may
have
been
or
encrypted
or
passed
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
through a VPN.
 
Recently,
the
company
Viasat—an
ISP
which
focuses
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on
internet-over-satellite—partnered
with
researchers
 
 
 
 
at
the
University
of
California,
San
Diego
to
develop
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
encrypted
traffic
classification
models
capable
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
detecting
whether
a
VPN
user
is
streaming
video
over
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
internet.
In
order
to
train
the
machine
learning
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
model,
a
dataset
of
streaming
and
browsing
network
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1
  
traffic
was
manually
generated
at
the
university.
For
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
many
researchers
in
the
field
of
traffic
classification
it
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is
common
to
similarly
self-generate
a
dataset
from
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
small
set
of
computers,
a
computer
lab,
or
a
single
area
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on
a
campus
[2][3][4].
However,
because
researchers
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
campuses
generally
have
access
to
relatively
good
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
network
conditions,
this
introduces
an
issue
of
data
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
representation—a
classifier
may
be
developed
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
trained
on
data
which
only
represents
good
network
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conditions.
When
it
comes
to
deploying
such
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
classifier,
we
cannot
reasonably
expect
all
internet
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
users
to
have
the
same
network
conditions.
For
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
example,
because
Viasat
provides
internet
over
 
 
 
 
 
 
satellite
rather
than
via
terrestrial
cables,
their
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
customers
will
have
substantially
greater
latency
than
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
users of a standard network setup.
 
In
our
paper
we
examine
the
performance
of
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
previously
developed
streaming
classifier
when
 
 
 
 
 
evaluated
on
network
traffic
data
generated
in
a
variety
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
network
conditions,
relying
on
a
tool
we
engineered
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
facilitate
and
automate
a
more
representative
data
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
generation and collection process.
 
2.
DATA
 
The
previous
dataset,
which
was
used
to
develop
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
train
the
streaming
classifier,
was
generated
by
a
total
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
19
researchers
at
UC
San
Diego
each
with
a
unique
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
device.
The
researchers
collected
data
with
strong,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
stable
internet
connections.
To
generate
the
raw
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
network
traffic,
each
participant
watched
videos
from
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
providers
such
as
YouTube,
Netflix,
and
Hulu,
or
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
browsed
the
internet
while
avoiding
such
websites.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These
data
were
labeled
‘streaming’
and
‘browsing’,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
respectively.
To
capture
the
raw
traffic
as
a
usable
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dataset,
Viasat
provided
the
tool,
network-stats,
which
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
summarizes
traffic
flows
on
a
per-connection,
 
 
 
 
 
 
per-second
basis
[5].
Each
second,
network-stats
 
 
 
 
 
 
outputs
metadata
such
as
the
timestamp,
source
source
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
destination
IPs,
applications
ports,
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
communication
protocol
for
each
unique
IP
pair
seen
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that
second.
For
each
pair
it
also
produces
traffic
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
statistics
such
as
the
aggregated
and
individual
counts,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
sizes
(bytes),
and
arrival/departure
times
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
downloaded/uploaded
packets
in
that
second.
 
 
 
 
 
Participants
collected
the
majority
of
data
while
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
connected
to
a
VPN
service
provided
by
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
university.
The
labeled
data
collected
manually
using
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
network-stats
formed
a
dataset
of
slightly
over
15
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hours
in
total
size
after
cleaning
and
removing
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
non-VPN
entries.
Streaming
data
constituted
8.2
hours
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
the
dataset
and
browsing
data
constituted
7
hours.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The
dataset
was
then
used
to
train
a
classification
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
model to detect streaming behavior from a traffic flow.
 
To
enable
our
analysis
of
the
classifier
in
different
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
network
conditions,
we
first
created
a
dataset
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
generation
tool,
DANE,
capable
of
emulating
target
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
network
conditions
and
automating
the
traffic
 
 
 
 
 
 
generation
and
collection
process
[6].
DANE
was
used
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
collect
streaming
and
browsing
data
by
utilizing
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
web
automation
scripts
which
visit
YouTube
to
watch
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
videos
or
endlessly
scrolls
through
Twitter.
The
tool
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
likewise
utilizes
network-stats
to
perform
data
 
 
 
 
 
 
collection
and
establishes
a
VPN
connection
to
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
same
university
service
as
was
used
to
collect
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
previous
dataset.
Independent
to
network
conditions,
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
output
data
from
DANE
closely
resembles
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
previous
dataset.
Data
was
collected
using
DANE
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
three target types of network conditions defined below.
 
Table 1: Network Condition Definitions
 
Each
time
the
tool
was
run,
we
collected
the
same
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
underlying
behavior
in
parallel
for
all
three
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conditions—i.e.
the
same
set
of
YouTube
videos
or
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Twitter
pages
were
visited
within
each
network
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
condition,
and
at
the
same
time.
This
ensured
that
any
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
difference
in
the
output
data
from
a
single
tool
run
was
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
due
solely
to
the
difference
in
network
conditions.
In
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
total,
approximately
50
hours
of
data
were
collected
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
using
our
tool
after
cleaning.
Streaming
constituted
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
nearly
40
hours
of
the
dataset,
with
13
hours
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
streaming data in each condition.

METHODS
 
To
motivate
our
analytical
focus,
we
start
by
visually
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
comparing
the
newly
collected
data
across
the
three
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
network
conditions.
A
simple
visualization
of
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
amount
of
data
downloaded
each
second
produces
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
powerful
and
intuitive
way
to
understand
differences
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in
most
traffic
flow
data.
Twenty-five
minute
snippets
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of our visual inspection are selected and shown below.
 
Fig 1: Megabits Downloaded in Each Second by Condition
 
(Browsing)
 
 
The
lack
of
visual
difference
between
conditions
for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
browsing
immediately
demonstrates
that
network
 
 
 
 
 
conditions
have
little
impact
on
browsing
data.
In
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
general,
browsing
is
not
a
demanding
task,
as
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reflected
in
the
small
overall
download
size
of
only
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
couple
hundred
bytes
per
second.
Most
data
seen
while
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
browsing
is
small
enough
to
be
sent
by
a
handful
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
packets,
so
latency
and
bandwidth
have
little
effect.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notably,
the
browsing
data
collected
is
not
fully
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reflective
of
real-world
browsing
data.
While
real
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
browsing
data
is
‘bursty’
in
nature—meaning
there
are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
periods
of
little
activity
interrupted
by
bursts
of
high
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
activity,
such
as
when
a
page
is
loaded—the
data
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
collected
appears
robotically
periodic.
This
is
because
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
data
collection
tool
utilizes
web
automation
scripts,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
replicating
human
browsing
behavior
with
code
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a
difficult,
unsolved
research
problem
[7].
That
said,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
behavior
was
consistent
in
all
conditions,
so
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lack
of
a
difference
suggests
network
condition
must
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have
had
little
effect.
The
purpose
of
our
research
is
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
study
differences
in
network
conditions,
which
 
 
 
 
 
 
apparently
cannot
be
achieved
by
analyzing
browsing
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
data.
Therefore
we
focus
the
rest
of
our
analysis
on
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
differences which arise within streaming data.
 
Fig 2: Megabits Downloaded in Each Second by Condition
 
(Streaming)
 
 
Streaming
data
shows
a
clear
difference
between
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
network
conditions.
Foremost,
the
height
of
each
chart
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is
indicative
of
the
bandwidth
available.
In
a
good
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
network,
well
over
40
megabits
of
data
may
be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
downloaded
within
a
single
second.
However,
in
an
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
average
or
poor
network
limited
to
a
bandwidth
of
10
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or
5
megabits
per
second,
respectively,
the
maximum
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
height
of
any
bar
is
correspondingly
limited.
In
each
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
charts,
brief
periods
of
inactivity
are
seen.
Most
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
streaming
service
providers
make
use
of
a
content
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
buffer
which
pre-downloads
future
content
as
the
user
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
is
watching.
When
approaching
the
end
of
a
video,
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
buffer
will
contain
the
remaining
data
for
the
video
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
no
more
data
needs
to
be
requested,
resulting
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
inactivity
seen
above.
After
the
video
ends
and
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
new
one
begins,
however,
the
buffer
needs
to
be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
quickly
refilled,
resulting
in
a
period
of
higher
activity.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These
bufferening
events
appear
different
for
each
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
network
condition
type.
In
good
networks,
the
entire
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
buffer
can
be
filled
quickly,
resulting
in
a
single
spike
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
activity.
In
average
networks,
the
same
amount
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
downloaded
data
is
spread
over
multiple
seconds
due
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
the
bandwidth
limitation,
resulting
in
a
denser
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
region
of
the
chart.
The
effect
applies
to
poor
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
networks,
however
the
visual
impact
of
a
buffering
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
event
doesn’t
appear
as
extreme
likely
due
to
video
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
resolution
automatically
being
lowered
by
YouTube
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
poor
network
conditions,
which
causes
far
less
data
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be requested overall.
 
Having
verified
a
substantial
difference
in
streaming
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
data
between
network
conditions,
we
now
explore
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
effect
of
network
condition
on
the
performance
of
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
classifier
trained
to
detect
streaming
behavior
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3
  
network
traffic.
We
wish
to
explore
the
performance
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
the
classifier
when
trained
on
the
previous
data
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
exposed
to
diverse
network
conditions.
To
do
so,
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
first
transform
our
new
dataset
using
the
same
cleaning
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
feature
engineering
pipeline
which
was
used
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
train
the
classifier
on
the
previous
dataset.
This
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pipeline
involves
splitting
the
multiple
hours
of
data
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
into
90-second
segments
of
packet-level
statistics
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
engineered
features.
After
preprocessing,
there
are
 
 
 
 
 
 
roughly
600
samples
of
data
in
the
previous
dataset
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
520
samples
of
streaming
data
for
each
condition
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in
the
new
dataset.
We
train
the
classifier
on
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
previous
dataset
using
a
70/30
train-test
split,
and
then
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
evaluate
the
classifier
on
the
test
set
of
the
previous
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dataset,
as
well
the
entirety
of
streaming
data
for
each
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
condition
in
the
new
dataset.
As
an
evaluation
metric,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
we
examine
the
false
negative
rate
(FNR),
which
is
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
proportion
of
streaming
samples
which
were
classified
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as
browsing.
Because
the
classifier
utilizes
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
non-deterministic
classification
model
and
there
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
randomness
introduced
by
the
train-test
split,
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
perform
500
independent
runs
of
the

RESULTS
 
After
500
runs
of
our
training
and
evaluation
process,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
we
examine
the
distribution
of
FNR
in
each
condition
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
the
previous
dataset’s
test
set
by
comparing
their
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
resulting
boxplots.
Note
that
lower
FNR
indicates
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
better
performance.
The
boxplot
shows
the
25th,
50th,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
75th
quantiles
of
FNR
in
each
group
with
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
whiskers
extending
to
at
most
1.5
times
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
interquartile
range
(the
75th
quantile
minus
the
25th
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
quantile).
Values
outside
of
the
whiskers
are
plotted
as
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
outlying points.

The
respective
medians
(50th
quantile),
means,
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
variances for FNR in each group are shown below.
 
Table 2: FNR Median, Mean, and Standard Deviation by
 
Condition
 
The
median
FNR
demonstrates
a
much
greater
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disparity
between
the
conditions
and
previous
dataset
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
than
the
mean.
This
is
most
likely
due
to
a
high
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
prevalence
of
outliers—perhaps
due
to
‘unlucky’
 
 
 
 
 
 
training
or
train-test
splits—as
can
be
seen
in
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
boxplots
in
Figure
3.
Regardless,
both
median
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mean
FNR
exhibit
an
absolute
difference
of
less
than
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
0.015
between
all
groups,
and
less
than
0.01
between
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
just the three conditions.
 
We
rely
on
statistical
tests
to
further
analyze
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
difference
between
the
median
and
mean
FNR
in
each
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
group.
A
one-way
ANOVA
test
for
differences
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
means
between
all
groups
produces
a
large
F-statistic
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
corresponding
p-value
of
practically
zero;
between
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
three
conditions
likewise
results
in
a
p-value
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
practically
zero.
Since
there
appear
to
be
many
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
outliers,
and
ANOVA
assumes
normality—an

also

Kruskal-Wallis
test
which
is
non-parametric
and
has
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
considerably
less

about
the
data.

for

between

results
in

These
results
suggest
that
differences
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in
FNR
between
the
conditions
are
highly
statistically
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
significant—consistently
different—even
though
the
 
 
 
 
scale of that difference is relatively small.
 
5.
DISCUSSION
 
Our
results
confirm
our
hypothesis
that
different
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
network
conditions
result
in
inherently
different
traffic
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
data,
which
in
turn
exhibits
a
clear,
statistically
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
significant
effect
on
classifier
performance.
That
said,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
even
though
the
effect
is
statistically
significant,
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
absolute
difference
in
FNR
of
less
than
0.015
is
not
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
substantial impact.
 
To
understand
why
the
classifier
still
performs
well
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
multiple
conditions,
we
need
to
examine
the
features
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
used
by
the
classification
model.
After
500
runs,
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
feature
importances
of
the
classification
can
be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
calculated as the normalized average feature weight.
 
Fig 4: Feature Importances of Streaming Classifier
 
 
Notably,
five
of
the
top
six
most
important
features
are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
features
derived
from
packet
size.
Maximum
packet
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
size
is
determined
by
the
maximum
transmissible
unit
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(MTU)
of
a
client-server
connection
which
is
typically
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1500
bytes
for
the
vast
majority
of
consumer-grade
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
networking
infrastructure,
and
is
not
influenced
by
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
network
conditions
like
latency
and
bandwidth.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Because
maximum
packet
size
is
fixed
across
network
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conditions,
we
hypothesize
that
the
feature
 
 
 
 
 
 
distributions
of
features
based
on
packet
size
will
not
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be
affected
by
condition.
We
can
explore
this
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hypothesis
by
directly
comparing
feature
distributions
 
 
 
 
 
 
across the three conditions and the previous dataset.
 
Fig 5: Feature Distribution of Mean Downloaded Packet
 
Size by Condition (Streaming)
 
 
Examining
the
mean
size
of
downloaded
packets—the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
third
most
important
feature—across
all
preprocessed
 
 
 
 
 
 
streaming
data
samples,
we
see
a
very
similar
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
distribution
arise
in
each
condition
and
in
the
previous
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dataset.
The
distributions
in
the
three
conditions
are
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
nearly
indistinguishable,
suggesting
that
indeed
 
 
 
 
 
network
condition
has
little
to
no
effect
on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
downloaded
packet
size.
The
slight
difference
between
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the
distribution
in
the
previous
dataset
is
most
likely
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
attributable
to
behavioral
noise
in
the
previous
dataset.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Because
the
previous
dataset
was
collected
manually,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
any
active
background
services
or
any
other
web
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
activity
the
user
engaged
in
while
collecting
data
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
would
also
be
labeled
as
streaming,
even
if
a
different
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
distribution
of
data
was
produced.
The
newly
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
generated
dataset
was
automated
to
produce
consistent
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and isolated streaming behavior data.
​

​
Admittedly,
behavioral
noise
is
perhaps
a
beneficial
component
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of
a
traffic
classification
dataset
because
it
is
likely
to
be
exhibited
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in
real-world
data.
Once
again,
the
automated
collection
tool
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
limited
by
the
ability
to
replicate
human-like
behavior
with
coded
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
scripts (i.e., humans are still the limiting factor!).

An
examination
of
the
proportion
of
downloaded
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
packets
larger
than
1200
bytes
across
all
samples—the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
most
important
feature—lends
itself
to
the
same
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conclusion as above.
 
Fig 6: Feature Dist. of Proportion of Large Downloaded
 
Packets by Condition (Streaming)
 
 
Once
again
we
observe
that
this
feature
distribution,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which
is
also
derived
from
individual
packet
sizes,
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
nearly
indistinguishable
across
the
three
conditions,
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
differs
minimally
from
the
previous
dataset.
We
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
will
not
replicate
the
analysis
of
means
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
proportions
for
packets
in
the
upload
direction
nor
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
small
packets
(less
than
200
bytes)
in
this
paper
since
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
their
results
are
consistent
with
what
we
have
already
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
discussed.
 
Finally
we
look
at
two
similar
features
which
aren’t
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
derived
from
packet
size
but
rather
the
total
amount
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
data
or
packets
downloaded
in
a
sample.
The
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
distribution
of
the
ratio
of
total
bytes
downloaded
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
versus
uploaded
appears
nearly
identical
across
all
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
groups.
However,
the
ratio
of
the
count
of
uploaded
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
versus
downloaded
packets
starts
to
show
some
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
variation.
 
Fig 7: Feature Dist. of Ratio of Uploaded vs. Downloaded
 
Bytes by Condition (Streaming)
 
 
Fig 8: Feature Dist. of Ratio of Uploaded vs Downloaded
 
Packet Counts by Condition (Streaming)
 
 
We
have
already
seen
in
Figure
2
that
network
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conditions
directly
influence
the
amount
of
packets
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
data
which
can
arrive
within
a
given
time
frame.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore,
we
expect
that
the
total
downloaded
bytes
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
total
number
of
downloaded
packets
differs
by
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
condition.
However,
most
streaming
providers
send
 
 
 
 
 
 
and
receive
packets
using
the
transmission
control
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
protocol
(TCP),
in
which
clients
periodically
upload
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
small
packets
containing
acknowledgements
(ACKs)
 
 
 
 
 
that
content
from
the
server
has
successfully
been
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
received.
Because
large
amounts
of
data
need
to
be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
downloaded
for
streaming,
and
acknowledgements
are
 
 
 
 
 
 
small,
we
see
in
Figure
7
that
regardless
of
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
network
condition
the
ratio
of
uploaded
to
downloaded
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
bytes
in
a
sample
of
data
is
most
dense
at
zero.
The
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ratio
of
packet
counts
shown
in
Figure
8
does
not
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6
  
depend
on
the
size
of
each
packet,
however,
and
we
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
start
to
see
slight
variance
between
the
network
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conditions.
As
this
feature
accounts
for
a
5%
decision
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
weight
in
the
streaming
classifier,
such
variance
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
between
the
network
conditions
likely
has
a
small
but
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
noticeable
effect
on
classifier
performance
which
may
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
have contributed to the findings in Figure 3.
 
The
streaming
classifier
which
was
developed
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
trained
on
the
previous
dataset
relies
most
heavily
on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
features
which
we
have
demonstrated
above
are
robust
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
changes
in
network
condition.
Thus,
it
is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
understandable
that
the
effect
of
network
condition
on
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
classifier performance is relatively small.
 
6.
CONCLUSION
 
In
this
paper,
we
showed
that
differences
in
network
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conditions
can
fundamentally
change
the
way
network
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
traffic
data
looks.
We
measured
the
effect
of
network
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conditions
on
performance
of
a
pre-trained
streaming
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
classifier,
and
determined
that
there
is
a
statistically
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
significant
difference
between
performance
when
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
model
is
evaluated
on
the
different
conditions.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However,
we
saw
that
the
overall
impact
on
model
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
performance
was
still
small.
This
reveals
that
if
a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
classifier
uses
features
which
are
robust
to
changes
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
network
conditions—such
as
packet
size—then
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
effect on the model performance is minimal.

Res Recovery: Classifying Video Resolutions Through a VPN Tunnel
 
 
Abstract
 
 
Virtual private networks, or VPNs, have seen a growth in popularity as more of the
 
general population has come to realize the importance of maintaining data privacy and security
 
while browsing the Internet. In previous works, our domain developed robust classifiers that
 
could identify when a user was streaming video. As an extension, our group has developed a
 
Random Forest model that determines the resolution at the time of video streaming with 87%
 
accuracy.
 
 
Introduction
 
 
VPNs reroute their users’ network traffic data through their own third-party private
 
servers, allowing them to disguise the precise details of their users’ network activity and provide
 
consumers complete anonymity. Though the usage of online security applications is certainly
 
beneficial to its consumers, VPNs prove to be an issue for Internet Service Providers (or ISPs)
 
who lose valuable information about their customers’ network traffic data that could be used to
 
improve the efficacy of their services. In particular, this loss of detail creates difficulties for ISPs
 
when trying to properly understand their customers’ needs and troubleshoot their users’ network
 
connectivity issues. For example, customers may experience long buffering times when
 
browsing the web but without knowing the exact circumstances regarding their activity, ISPs are
 
unable to effectively provide helpful solutions to remedy their users’ issues.
 
 
Over the course of ten weeks, students mentored by the Viasat community were able to
 
construct robust classifiers that are capable of determining whether or not a user is streaming
 
video while connected to a VPN. Our project is designed to be an extension of this past work as
 
we develop a multi-class classification model that can identify the resolution of a video that was
 
viewed over a VPN connection. The assumption for our project is that the classifier that we build
 
will serve as the second half of a two-part pipeline, where the inputted data is first categorized as
 
being video or non-video, and, when appropriate, is then provided an additional label specifying
 
resolution.
 
The premise of our project initially seemed relatively simple as, intuitively, we believed
 
that streaming video at higher resolutions would require more bandwidth. This assumption was
 
true but only to a certain extent. Depending on the user’s network conditions and capabilities, the
 thresholds separating the 6 different resolutions would often begin to overlap between users.
 
Application of spectral analysis (Fourier transform) helped to alleviate some of this overlap but it
 
still proved to be difficult to construct a model that is able to precisely identify the numeric
 
resolution value for a given video. Therefore, our final classifier opts for a “low”, “medium”, and
 
“high” labeling system that serves to provide a general but concise range of resolutions that a
 
user might potentially be streaming video at.
​

​
 Given this tool, ISPs will be able to notice when
 
their users are consistently streaming video at much lower resolutions than they should be
 
capable of and help them to resolve such problems.
 
 
Methods
 
 
Data
 
 
We had two primary requirements when selecting a video streaming provider: full
 
autonomy over video quality selection and the ability for a single video to be streamed at
 
multiple resolutions. For these reasons, we decided to use YouTube as our primary source..
 
 
Network traffic data was recorded using Viasat’s script, Network Stats.
​
2
​
  The script
 
allows us to observe the transactions of data that occur between two unique IP addresses each
 
second. Since video streaming data at any resolution utilizes a larger magnitude of bandwidth
 
than local network activity, further data cleaning to isolate VPN activity was not necessary. To
 
supplement the Viasat script, we developed a Selenium script to help automate the data
 
collection process. Keeping our previous data requirements in mind, 
​
the script was designed in
 
such a way that the user only needs to provide a YouTube playlist containing all of the desired
 
videos as well as a list of target resolutions. Once this information is inputted, the script then
 
streams each video at each of the given resolutions and collects network traffic data for each
 
video/resolution pair
​
. For our data set, 
​
each group member captured data for a single Youtube
 
video six times, once for each of the six resolutions that we had selected beforehand. This was
 
key to our data collection process as it ensured consistency in the sizes of the training data
 
collected for each label and it minimized the influence of any potential external factors.
 
Assigning each member the task of collecting data over their own network also helped to
 
incorporate a variety of different network conditions into our model, improving its overall
 
robustness.
​
 Our final dataset is composed of data collected from 20 unique videos at the
 
resolutions 144p, 240p, 360p, 480p, 720p, and 1080p for a total of over 25 hours worth.
 
Since Network Stats collects observations by the second, grouping the data into chunks (a
 
section of continuous data) is necessary to generate sufficient useful information for engineering
 
features. A larger chunk size is preferred due to the fact that our classifier will be less prone to
 
misclassifying sudden influxes of bytes. However, for the purposes of our project, a smaller
 
chunk size is also preferred since it would allow users of our tool to be able to quickly capture
 
and classify their data. We determined that 5-minute chunks were the best length for describing
 
1
 High = 720p & 1080p; Medium = 360p & 480p; Low = 144p & 240p

 network behavior. This 5-minute data overhead means that users of our model will have to
 
collect more data but the increased accuracy is a worthy tradeoff. As such, all of 
​
our network
 
traffic data captures were preprocessed to be 5-minute samples. Moving forward, it would be
 
correct to assume that we are working exclusively with 5-minute chunks and that all features
 
were created from 5-minute chunks.
 
 
Features
 
Our features can be categorized into 3 distinct categories: basic aggregate/thresholding
 
features, spike analysis-derived features, and spectral analysis-derived features (in the frequency
 
domain). The basic aggregate/thresholding features were designed to establish some preliminary
 
boundaries that could separate the resolutions based on observations we made during our
 
exploratory data analysis. Our spike analysis also yielded additional features that helped to
 
define some of the unique characteristics of each resolution. And, given the data’s signal-like
 
properties, we also leveraged spectral analysis to engineer features that could identify the
 
frequency of bytes being sent from the VPN server. Note that our group made the conscious
 
decision to focus primarily on the download direction of bytes as opposed to the upload.
​
3
 
Preliminary EDA showed that behaviors between the two byte stream directions are mirrored -
 
download is simply larger in magnitude of bytes. If necessary, a full table of the features can be
 
found in the appendix.
 
 
1.
Analyzing Byte Stream
 
Our initial features came from analyzing the download bytes stream. As stated
 
previously, we know that streaming at higher video qualities generally requires more data to be
 
sent over the network in order for the given video to be viewed properly. Based on our analysis,
 
we were able to conclude the following: captures for high resolution videos had the highest
 
frequency of data being transmitted and the largest magnitude of bytes. Captures for medium
 
resolution videos exhibited a similar magnitude of bytes but at a lower frequency. Captures for
 
low resolution videos had both the smallest magnitude of bytes as well as the lowest frequency
 
of bytes sent. With these results in mind, we decided to use the average and standard deviation of
 
bytes per second as features. The average and standard deviation values create basic thresholds
 
that give a general idea of how much data is required for each resolution. Below is a distribution
 
of the downloaded bytes per second for a single 6-minute video captured at every resolution. We
 
can visually see that as the resolution increases, the average number of bytes being downloaded
 
increases as well.

 download: VPN server to local machine; upload: local machine to VPN server
  
 
2.
Data Peaks/Spikes
 
Data peaks/spikes are defined as being ‘large’ transactions of data that are received over
 
the network in a given second. Finding a minimum threshold value for determining whether or
 
not a data point should be considered a peak took some experimentation but we ultimately
 
decided upon 5 megabits (Mbs) as our minimum value.
​
4
​
  Using this, we were able to extract a
 
total of 4 features: the average and standard deviation of the peak byte size, the total number of
 
peaks, and the seconds-to-peak ratio. The most interesting feature that we extracted was the ratio
 
of seconds to peaks. Originally, we tried taking the average of the time intervals (in seconds)
 
between peaks to use as a feature instead, however, due to outliers in the data, we discovered that
 
it was not as discriminative as we had formerly believed. In particular, this feature failed to be
 
useful in cases where the network would send large amounts of data in rapid succession for a
 
low-resolution video capture. Because this trend tends to happen only in captures for
 
high-resolution videos, our model would often misclassify these low-resolution video captures as
 
being high-resolution. As such, we developed the seconds-to-peak ratio as a feature since it is
 
robust to this corner case of a sudden peak influx.
 
 
4
 5 megabits = 625000 bytes
  
 
The plot on the left illustrates how, in general, as the resolution increases, the average peak byte
 
size increases as well. On the right, we can see that the ratio of seconds-to-peak decreases as the
 
resolution increases, which illustrates how the quantity and consistency of peaks increase as the
 
quality improves.
 
 
3.
Spectral Analysis
 
After extracting some features from within the time domain, we shifted our focus to the
 
frequency domain. We did this by first resampling our data into 2-second intervals and then
 
utilizing an application of the Fourier Transform called Welch’s method. When applying Welch's
 
method on clean data and plotting the periodogram, you should expect to see a well-defined peak
 
that is significantly larger than the rest, signifying which frequencies are the strongest in your
 
data. In our analysis, we found that these well-defined peaks are present in the periodograms for
 
high-resolution video data but are less apparent in the periodograms for low- or even
 
medium-resolution video data. For the captures of the low and medium qualities, we saw
 
multiple peaks of similar magnitudes, but no single peak that stood out.
 
 
In terms of feature engineering, we identified the peaks (no hard threshold; relative to the
 
chunk) shown in the periodograms and calculated their prominences. Prominence describes how
 
much larger in magnitude a peak is in relation to its neighbors. We saw that captures for
 
high-resolution videos consistently produced large maximum prominence values, captures for
 
medium-resolution videos produced lesser maximum prominence values, and captures for
 
low-resolution videos produced the smallest maximum prominence values. Thus, the first
 
spectral analysis-derived feature that we generated was the maximum peak prominence. To
 
capture the fact that the spread of the peaks in captures for lower resolution videos is smaller
 
than its higher counterpart, we took the standard deviation of the maximum prominence values
 as a feature as well. In the frequency domain, the bandwidth requirements to support streaming
 
high resolution video results in signals whose power values are much greater than their lower
 
resolution counterparts. We show this down below where we also plot the frequency
 
distributions and have scaled the y-axis to be the same across all graphs to highlight these
 
differences.
 
 
 
 
 
Results
 
 
For our classifier, we ultimately decided to implement a Random Forest model. Since our
 
features are fairly correlated with each other, we hoped that the inherent randomness of the
 
Random Forest algorithm would overcome some of this collinearity. The algorithm was also
 
selected because it allows us to see which features are heavily influential in the decision process
 
and which features fail to make an impact.
 
 
Baseline Model
 
Our baseline model was made to ensure that the features we had created and extracted
 
were significant enough to differentiate resolutions that were farther apart. We took a subset of
 
our training data (240p, 480p, 1080p), trained a Random Forest classifier, and achieved an
 
accuracy of 91% with the 9 aforementioned features. Below is the normalized confusion matrix
 and F1-scores for each label. We can see that the model performs perfectly for 240p, but tends to
 
struggle slightly for the higher resolutions. The classifier also does not misclassify 240p as
 
1080p, and vice versa. However, we do see that 480p is sometimes mistaken as being either 240p
 
or 1080p.
 
 
 
 
 
We can see above that the features that are closely related to the amount of downloaded bytes
 
[“peak_avg”, “prominence_std”, & “max_prominence”] tend to have higher importances than
 
the other features used in the classifier. This is to be expected as we saw that there are
 
considerable differences in the bandwidth requirements for the 3 selected resolutions.
 
 
Extended Model
 
Originally, we planned to expand our model to be able to predict the exact resolution.
 
However, once we utilized the full training set, our accuracy dropped drastically to 73%. Trying
 
to create a model that could accurately label the numeric resolution value for quality proved
 
difficult so we opted to bin the resolutions. Our final model takes in a network traffic data

 capture and outputs either “low”, “medium”, or “high” as the label. For the purposes of our
 
project, low corresponds to the resolutions 144p & 240p, medium corresponds to 360p & 480p,
 
and high corresponds to 720p & 1080p. Using the same 9 features as before, our final model is
 
able to produce an accuracy of 87%.
 
 
 
 
 
 
As stated previously, our classifier experienced a decrease in overall accuracy. We can also see
 
that the F1-score for the ‘medium’ label is the lowest out of the 3. This suggests that there are
 
instances within captures for medium-resolution data that closely resemble low- or
 
high-resolution data. 
​
In addition, we see that the standard deviation of the peak byte sizes within
 
a chunk was not a good differentiator of resolutions; this could be due to the fact that the spikes
 
in a chunk do not vary drastically in byte size, resulting in similar standard deviation values
 
across the whole dataset.
 
We can also see that a 2-class jump misclassification has occurred, where a
 
high-resolution sample of data is predicted as being low-resolution. This exemplifies one of the

 potential issues with selecting a smaller chunk size to utilize. Observing the data, there are many
 
scenarios where a small subsection of a high-resolution data can sometimes resemble
 
low-resolution data or even non-video data. For example, when Youtube plays an ad, the server
 
stops sending data during the duration of the ad and the level of network activity greatly
 
decreases. Increasing the chunk size would likely help aid this problem, however, the 5-minute
 
data overhead is quite intense already and, in our opinion, increasing this requirement is not
 
worth the small increase in accuracy.
 
 
Discussion
 
 
Given the overall success that we had in creating our models, we decided to try to take
 
our project a step further and attempted to create a more extensive model that would be capable
 
of classifying the exact resolution, and not just the degree of quality. After visualizing various
 
plots for each resolution, we were able to visually identify differences amongst the 6 classes,
 
however, we were unsuccessful in generating useful features that implemented these differences.
 
We fed numerous different combinations of our features; however, we were faced with issues in
 
accurately classifying 720p. The model performed well for all of the other resolutions, but would
 
often misclassify an overwhelming amount of 720p captures as being 1080p.
 
Looking towards the future, one approach that could be taken to extend our work would
 
be to engineer additional discriminative features that could help to establish a more accurate
 
model that is able to classify specific resolutions. Another approach could be to include a larger
 
variety of resolutions into our classifier such as 1440p and higher. Other interesting topics might
 
include an analysis of the amount of information that can be extracted from network traffic data.
 
Analyzing the differences in the network traffic data for popular and unpopular YouTube videos
 
or distinguishing the content type of a video (such as action vs. still) are topics that could be of
 
interest as well.
 
Overall, we found the extent of the information that we were able to learn from the
 
network traffic data that we collected through a VPN connection to be fascinating.  However,
 
while working with this data, discussion over the amount of knowledge that should be able to be
 
extracted while someone is using a VPN was common amongst our members. VPNs are
 
supposed to establish a sense of privacy for the user, and while these tools are created with the
 
intention of ultimately fostering a better experience for the customer, it is important to keep
 
ethical implications such as this in mind.

INTRODUCTION
 
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) strive to understand
 
network conditions in order to better user experience.
 
Currently, with more people using virtual private networks
 
(VPN), machine learning algorithms that provide insight
 
into the complex activity between the user and the VPN can
 
provide enormous value to ISPs. In past work with Viasat,
 
we have created classifiers that were successfully able to
 
identify streaming data from browsing data across a VPN.
 
Thus, now we design an algorithm that is able to take raw
 
network data recorded in a VPN and output a streaming
 
provider.
 
 
 
This paper proposes an algorithm known as 
​
Streaming
 
Provider Identifying Classifier Inside a VPN
​
 (SPICIVPN,
 
pronounced “Spicy VPN”) which can differentiate between
 
5 different streaming providers (i.e. Netflix, Youtube,
 
Amazon Prime, Twitch, and Youtube Live) with an
 
accuracy of 96.5%. The strength of SPICIVPN lies in the
 
thirteen features that process the raw data collected from
 
Network Stats 
​
[1]. Such features are fed to a Random Forest
 
Classifier which on average takes 10 minutes to process the
 
raw data and produce an output.
 
 
 
The first part of our paper consists of the explanation of
 
each feature. Next, we describe our model and
 
hyperparameters in detail. Finally, we present the results
 
obtained from SPICIVPN.

​
1.2 METHODS
 
 
The goal of this project is to make a machine learning (ML)
 
model that can classify what streaming service was being
 
used over a VPN. After exploring different models, we
 
decided to use a Random Forest Classifier utilizing
 
engineered features. It is important to incorporate
 
meaningful features to help improve the accuracy of our
 
model and keep variance low.
 
 
 
In creating the classifier, we collected network traffic data
 
to train and test the model. The data was collected from a
 
variety of different sources such as Netflix, Amazon Prime,
 
Youtube, Twitch,  Youtube Live, Disney+, Discovery+, and
 
Hulu. All the data was collected at 1 times speed under
 
clean network conditions, meaning no other traffic was
 
being recorded besides the streaming capture. Each file
 
notes at least the streaming platform and user who collected
 
the data.
 
 
 
In creating features, we began by conducting exploratory
 
data analysis on the data from the different streaming
 
platforms. We compared the different platforms by
 
analyzing the differences in their packet data, spectral
 
analysis, and a variety of other features which we deemed
 
meaningful for identifying the different streaming
 
platforms.
 
 
 
An initial approach when looking at unique patterns
 
between the different streaming platforms was looking at
 
the packet sizes being transferred. When graphing the
 
frequency of packet sizes for each streaming provider, there
 
was a distinct pattern for each provider. Specifically when
 
analyzing the ratio of packets from different ranges to all of
 
the packet sizes. These ranges included [0-200] , [200-400]
 
and [1200+] bytes. This was the initial process that led to
 
the creation of three features used in the final model of
 
ratio of small, medium, and large packets.
 
 
2. RESULTS
 
When making the model, we first wanted to see the
 
potential differences between the different service
 
providers. We began by looking at the differences between
 
Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Youtube’s network traffic. All
 
of the figures in this section are plots of every file we
 
collected for a provider plotted together. The varying colors
 
indicated different recordings. In using these plots we can
 
see generalized patterns across the 100 recordings.
 
 
2.1 AMAZON PRIME
 
We began by looking at the upload and download patterns
 
of Amazon Prime. Some interesting finds from the data
 
were the surprising shelf found in the upload byte rate of the
 
data, and the max download byte of the data. In looking at
 
the graph of the download bytes of all the collected Amazon
 
Prime data in Figure 1, we can see that Amazon Prime
 
download rates can spike up to and over 8 MB, which we
 
found to be higher than any of the other video on demand
 
providers. These spikes were at the start of the videos,
 
which help show that Amazon Prime has larger initial
 
downloads rates to help get video content to start the videos.
 
After this large initial download, the rate drops significantly
 
to be around 1 MB or below.

The upload bytes also had an interesting pattern. When
 
looking at the graph of upload bytes of all the collected
 
Amazon Prime data in Figure 2, we can see  clearly that
 
there is a shelf around .06 MB. This is a  consistent pattern
 
that can help the model identify Amazon Prime Videos.
 
 
  
Figure 2: Upload Byte Rate of Amazon Prime
 
 
2.2 NETFLIX
 
Then we repeated the same process for Netflix. We found
 
that both the upload and download patterns of Netflix are
 
very different from those of Amazon Prime. As we can see
 
from Figure 3, there are several spikes in the download
 
bytes in the beginning of the collected videos, with the
 
largest spikes located at sometime after the very start of the
 
videos, unlike the case with Amazon Prime. Also, the
 
general download bytes rate can go above 2MB, making the
 
pattern more constant than that of Amazon Prime because
 
the spikes are not as much larger than the bytes for the rest
 
of the time. This shows that Netflix is making more
 
constant downloads along with the videos playing and also
 
has some initial large downloads to get the content of the
 
videos.
 
 
 
 
Figure 3: Download Byte Rate of Netflix
 
 
The upload rates of Netflix looks very similar to its
 
download pattern, as seen in Figure 4. However, it is clearer
 
that the values of upload bytes are decreasing as the videos
 
play and there is no apparent shelf like Amazon Prime does.
 
This pattern is rather unique and distinct to Netflix upload
 
rates.
 
 
Figure 4: Upload Byte Rate of Netflix
 
2.3 YOUTUBE
 
For the download trends of Youtube, we found that there
 
are  obvious shelves around 2.9 MB and 1.9 MB. The larger
 
shelf appears at earlier stages of the videos than the smaller
 
one. This is unique in that Youtube downloads the videos at
 
the most stable and consistent rate. And even though we can
 
see some spikes in the beginning of the videos, they are
 
only half large as those of Netflix and Amazon Prime, and
 
very close to the download rate for the rest of the time. And
 
unlike Netflix which has more gradual decreases of
 
download rate over time, Youtube has decreases that are
 
more noticeable because it has two apparent shelves as
 
mentioned before. The small spikes and stepwise decrease
 
over time are two important characteristics that separate
 
Youtube data from other providers.
 
 
Figure 5:  Download Byte Rate of Youtube
 
 
The upload byte rate of Youtube, as shown in Figure 6, is
 
very similar to its download rate. There are no apparent
 
 shelves in the pattern. But we can see that the rate is
 
decreasing in two or three approximate stages. Also, the
 
upload bytes can spike up beyond .30 MB, which are the
 
largest among the non-live video providers we investigated
 
and help the model distinguish Youtube videos.
 
 
 
Figure 6: Upload Byte Rate of Youtube
 
 
2.4 TWITCH
 
Section 2.4 and 2.5 look at live video streaming. When
 
analyzing the download rate of Twitch we found no clear
 
pattern in the data. In fact, most files present spikes of
 
varying length at different points in time. Moreover, it
 
appears that the majority of the data is downloaded earlier
 
on the streaming while maintaining a steady flow of packets
 
toward the end. At a first glance, one would be able to tell
 
apart Twitch’s live download rate versus download rate
 
from on demand providers.
 
 
 
Figure 7: Download Byte Rate of Twitch
 
 
The upload rates of Twitch shown in Figure 8 stands out for
 
there being data sent back only in the beginning of the
 
streaming. All the files we collected show a similar
 
behavior. In fact, at point 750 in time, the number of bytes
 
travelling from our machine to the Twitch’s server almost
 
drops to zero with no exception.
 
 
 
Figure 8:  Upload Byte Rate of Twitch
 
2.5 YOUTUBE LIVE
 
Youtube Live is the other live streaming provider we
 
collected data from. From the download rate we can notice
 
a lower amount of megabytes being received as compared
 
to Twitch. In addition, as opposed to Twitch, the download
 
rate reveals a clearer pattern with more consistent and
 
regular arrival of data. Moreover, around
​
 
​
point 800
​
 
​
in time
 
there appears to be a decrease in the download rate. Finally,
 
there is an outlier that spikes several times.
 
 
 
 
Figure 9: Download Byte Rate of Youtube Live
 
 
Youtube Live’s upload rate shown in Figure 10 assimilates
 
to Twitch’s upload rate in the fact that bytes are being
 
transferred back from the local machine up to a certain point
 
in time before coming to a stop. However, Youtube Live
 
 presents more constituency and regularity than Twitch. In
 
fact, most of the files overlap with the exception of one
 
outlier.
 
 
 
 
Figure 10: Upload Byte Rate of Youtube Live
 
 
2.6 OTHER PROVIDERS
 
At last, we looked at the download and upload patterns of
 
Disney+, Discovery+, and Hulu, which we treated as the
 
‘Others’ category. We can see that the download pattern
 
fairly resembles the Amazon Prime download pattern such
 
that it also has large spikes in the beginning and then they
 
drop below 1 MB. However, the difference between spikes
 
and the constant rate periods are much larger than that of
 
Amazon Prime. This can make videos from ‘Others’
 
providers identifiable but also increase the number of
 
mistakes our model will make because of the similarity with
 
Amazon Prime. In fact, the most misclassified cases are
 
between ‘Others’ providers and Amazon Prime.
 
 
Figure 11: Download Byte Rate of Others
 
 
In the upload bytes pattern, we can see that there are
 
multiple spikes at different times throughout the graph in
 
Figure 12. This is potentially caused by the fact that we
 
used three different providers Disney+, Discovery+, and
 
Hulu, to make up the ‘Others’ category. Since they each
 
may have differences in upload rate patterns, the combined
 
pattern can be very unexpected when putting them together.
 
Nevertheless, we can also see that mostly the upload bytes
 
are small and they form really large height gaps with the
 
extreme spikes. The overall pattern is still very identifiable
 
as it is different than the upload patterns of the other
 
providers we have looked at before.
 
 
Figure 12: Upload Byte Rate of Others
 
2.7 CLASSIFIER
 
In our random forest classifier, we were able to make a
 
model that performed with high accuracy. We chose to
 
select a random forest classifier based on previous work.
 
Although we all made separate classifiers for classifying
 
streaming data versus non streaming  data, we each made a
 
model utilizing the random forest classifier. Therefore we
 
chose to use it for this data as we saw that they already had
 
success on similar data.  We utilized features such as mean
 
packet size, rolling delays, small and large packet ratios,
 
byte 
​
coefficient of variation
​
 and maximum frequency
 
prominence. The following features will be discussed in
 
order of feature ranking as determined by the Random
 
Forest Classifier feature importance method.
 
 
 
  
Figure 13: Feature Importances
 
The most significant feature in our model is the uploaded
 
mean packet size. This is a simple, but informative metric
 
that accounts for 16% of all feature importances. Our
 
intuition behind the strength of this feature lies in the belief
 
that different streaming providers would require clients to
 
upload packets of varying sizes. Since most streaming
 
services utilize internet protocols such as Transmission
 
Control Protocol (TCP), for every two packets received, the
 
client must also send in Acknowledgement packet (ACK).
 
Although the minimum ACK packet size is 40, each
 
streaming provider may have different ACK sizes, thus
 
leading to a feature that can discern between providers.
 
Similarly, mean download packet size will also vary
 
between providers. However, we believe that this feature
 
underperforms due to the fact that the client is constantly
 
downloading packets with a full payload during the
 
presence of video streaming to maintain quality and
 
consistency.
 
 
 
Next, we hypothesized that each provider would transmit
 
packets at different timings. To test this hypothesis, we first
 
developed inter-packet delay, which measures the amount
 
of time between the arrival of the previous packet and the
 
following packet. To summarize the inter-packet delay for a
 
given 90 second clip, we calculated the mean of the
 
inter-packet delay over rolling windows of 10 and 60
 
seconds. These features serve to examine inter-packet
 
arrival times in both small and large windows of the clip,
 
which can reveal periodic patterns in how each provider
 
transmits packets.
 
 
To further explore periodic patterns, we use signal
 
processing methods in the frequency domain. Due to the
 
nature of streaming, all packets should arrive at a stable
 
frequency. Therefore, we use Welch’s method to compute
 
the power spectral density (PSD) of downloaded packet
 
sizes. First, we resample our dataset at a consistent sample
 
rate of 500ms. Next, we transform PSD into amplitude
 
spectral density, which is defined as the square of PSD. This
 
allows us to examine the prevalence of unique signaling
 
frequencies. For example, we found that Youtube exhibits a
 
strong download frequency at 0.2Hz. This means that for
 
every 5 seconds, Youtube is transmitting a stable packet
 
size. To extract this information into a feature, we calculate
 
the maximum prominence (or magnitude of the peak) of
 
that frequency at 0.2Hz.
 
 
 
 
Figure 14: Prevalence of frequencies in Packet Size
 
 
Another feature is the coefficient of variation of the
 
uploaded bytes. The coefficient of variation is the ratio of
 
the standard deviation to the mean. By calculating the ratio
 
for each small chunk of data, we can get the variability in
 
regions of given datasets and find similar features to the
 
providers our model is trained to differentiate. The upload
 
bytes coefficient of variation patterns proved to be a key
 
feature for our model.
 
 
Next, we focused our analysis on ratios of varying packet
 
sizes. We used the ratio of small uploaded packets (less than
 
200 bytes) over the count of all uploaded packets, as well as
 
the ratio of large downloaded packets (greater than 1200
 
bytes) over the count of all uploaded packets. These features
 
allow us to analyze how each streaming provider utilizes
 
small and large packets when receiving data from the client.
 
Similarly, we calculated the ratio of large downloaded
 
packets over the count of all downloaded packets. However,
 
we chose to omit the ratio of small downloaded packets
 
over all downloaded packets as it was not a significant
 
feature in our model.
 
 
The next feature included in our classifier was the
​
 
​
ratio of
 
small packet sizes uploaded compared to the entire number
 
 of packets. For this particular feature, it included the
 
number of packets that were less than 200 bytes over the
 
total number of packets in a particular dataset. Similar to the
 
ratio of small packets, another feature incorporated in the
 
classifier consisted of the ratio of medium packets. This
 
means the number of packets that were between the range of
 
200 and 400 bytes per packet over the total number of
 
packets in a particular dataset. The final feature follows this
 
trend as the ratio of large packets including the number of
 
packets that were larger than 1200 bytes per packet over the
 
total number of packets in a particular dataset. These
 
features were all calculated over the entire 5-minute data.
 
 
3. DISCUSSIONS
 
The model performed well on our test data, with 96.5%
 
accuracy. We were able to accomplish the goal of creating a
 
classifier that was able to differentiate between the different
 
chosen service providers. However, there are limitations to
 
our model and its performance.
 
 
 
Figure 15: Precision, Recall, F1 for each provider
 
 
One of the trends we noticed with our classifier was that it
 
had the lowest accuracy on Amazon Prime data. When we
 
ran a precision, recall, F1-score and support command for
 
the different classes, we found that Amazon Prime had a
 
precision of .93, Youtube had a precision of .95, the other
 
category, Youtube Live, and Twitch had .97, and Netflix
 
had a precision of .98. For our dataset and classification
 
purposes, we understand that precision is more important
 
than recall because the cost of false positives is higher than
 
the cost of false negatives
​
. 
​
Therefore, even though the
 
Other and Twitch Live categories have lower recall scores,
 
their high precision makes up for that loss. Moreover, with
 
the F1 score being a balance between precision and recall,
 
we see that our model’s success in being able to achieve at
 
least a 95% F1 score for all classes.
 
 
We then looked at the confusion matrix, seen in Figure 15
 
and could see that most of the misclassifications occurring
 
were predicting that Other, Youtube, or Youtube Live was
 
Amazon Prime. We also can see from the confusion matrix
 
that there were a few data segments incorrectly identified as
 
Youtube. As the other class had the most misclassifications
 
for Prime, it is possible that the other data looked like the
 
Prime data. This could potentially lower model accuracy, if
 
the providers in the other category became classes in the
 
model.
 
 
 
Figure 16: Confusion Matrix without Normalization
 
 
Figure 17: Normalized Confusion Matrix
 
 
Another limitation is our model was trained on clean, one
 
time speed data, which could affect the model performance.
 
To deploy this model for more usage cases, we would need
 
to test it on data recorded in more conditions, such as noisy
 
conditions, different playback speeds, and different
 
resolutions. While it is easier to control the playback speed
 
and noise levels during the recording, only a couple of
 
providers allow for manual selection of resolution, so we
 
allowed each program to select resolution based on the
 
internet speed. Training the model on more data that
 
covered these features would create a more robust model.
 
 
 
 As more streaming provider platforms get released, which
 
seems to be an increasing trend, data could be collected and
 
used to train and test the model. Understanding the
 
intricacies of the different streaming providers network
 
patterns would be beneficial for ISPs to understand how to
 
best deliver the content.
 
 
 
Another thing to consider in creating this model are the
 
ethical implications. While our project is being used in an
 
educational capacity, there are ethical implications to
 
tracking individuals data use, especially when they are
 
using a VPN. Although people may use VPNs to have
 
secure connections, some positive ways to use this as an ISP
 
would be to help based network configurations on streaming
 
data. On the other hand, this could also allow for ISPs to
 
learn what streaming providers their clients are using, which
 
could be considered a breach in privacy. Even though this
 
project could pose some ethical implications, we think
 
understanding the network conditions that could optimize
 
streaming for clients over a VPN is beneficial for their
 
streaming experience.
 
 
 
In conclusion, there are several key takeaways from this
 
project. First, we are able to achieve overall high accuracy
 
in our model and other metrics like precision and F1-score
 
are also high. Second, the high accuracy we get is a result
 
from the features we used. We eventually decided to keep
 
13 features because each one contributes to making the
 
model perform better by capturing the various differences
 
between different providers. Also, they help increase the
 
generalizability of our model such that the classification is
 
not merely dependent on some features fitted exactly to the
 
streaming providers which we have in our training data.  To
 
prove that, we added Twitch live and Youtube live to the
 
scope of classification. Initially we had started off with just
 
Netflix, Youtube and  Amazon Prime and had an accuracy
 
of 97%.  Since our model works well on them too, we can
 
see that the features are very generalizable as they even
 
have good performance on live data. At last, taking the
 
limitations of this project into consideration and trying to
 
use this project as a basis for a working tool can be helpful
 
for ISPs like Viasat to know their performances and
 
improve their services.

Appendix C. Project Proposal
 
Throughout this past quarter, we have worked with Viasat
 
to build classifiers that are able to identify if there is video
 
being streaming in a VPN. Using flow level data, packet
 
level data, and self-engineered features, we have built an
 
understanding of video patterns and signatures over a VPN.
 
However, our current model only identifies whether a VPN
 
user is streaming video. As an extension to our Q1 progress,
 
this project will take a further look at classifying the
 
streaming provider a user is using while connected to a
 
VPN. This includes differentiating whether a streaming
 
video is from Youtube, Netflix, Amazon Prime or others. If
 
our classifier is successful, ISPs like Viasat can detect the
 
presence of streaming and determine the streaming
 
providers and use that information to optimize internet plans
 
for certain streaming services.
 
 
As in quarter 1, we would be generating our own data using
 
the network-stats tool provided to us by Viasat. In order to
 
collect an abundant amount of data for our models to be
 
trained accurately, we will use network-stats in conjunction
 
with scripted and automated browsers to capture streaming
 
data on various providers. For this quarter, we will be
 
collecting VPN encrypted data and will vary the collection
 
process on streaming providers. Similar to Q1, this data is
 
capable of addressing our problem as it contains data on
 
each flow and packet, including client and server IPs and
 
ports, packet size, time and direction. It will go through
 
similar cleaning and preprocessing steps, as well as build on
 
top of the binary classifier from the previous quarter since
 
we need to ensure there is video streaming present in the
 
network data.
 
 
While there are trends across the different video service
 
providers, each has different networking requirements as to
 
optimize the experience for the user. At our brainstorming
 
stage, we are considering using payload sizes and packet
 
transfer patterns as features for our model to distinguish
 
between providers. We hypothesize that Amazon Prime and
 
Youtube, for example, may send packets with different
 
sizes, interpacket delays, or size of packet clusters. Another
 
potential feature would be buffering patterns for various
 
providers. For example, the time-series visualization of
 
downloaded bytes shows that Amazon Prime will buffer
 
slowly at the start of the video, but keep the stream
 
consistent and clear throughout the video to create an
 
 immersive experience. On the other hand, Youtube will
 
buffer fast at the beginning so that users may start watching
 
their video sooner, but may continue to buffer or even slow
 
down their buffering later into the video. This can transform
 
into a feature by looking at packet patterns right when we
 
begin the video stream.
 
 
 
As a stretch goal, we also wish to determine whether the
 
streaming provider is sending the video at their maximum
 
possible resolution. We would also like to add more
 
functionality to the classifier by training it to classify more
 
providers, such as Hulu, HBOMax, etc. Our project will be
 
summarized in a paper explaining our findings of our
 
machine learning model. In our paper, we will include our
 
data collection process, EDA and feature engineering
 
process, model selection, fine-tuning, and outputs to best
 
communicate our findings. In addition, the model will be
 
the main output since it will be able to run any
 
network-stats data and classify the presence of streaming as
 
well as the streaming provider.
 
 
Something to consider in doing this project are the ethical
 
implications. While from an academic perspective, it is
 
interesting to be able to understand these trends, there is
 
concern that creating a classifier to know what streaming
 
service you are using within a VPN could be considered an
 
invasion of privacy. Although we are working with Viasat
 
to understand these mechanisms, we do not intend for our
 
classifier to be used on real client data, solely our
 
educational dataset.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
","This paper discusses the development of a classifier that can determine the streaming service provider being used over a VPN connection. The classifier, called SPICIVPN (Streaming Provider Identifying Classifier Inside a VPN), utilizes traffic flow statistics and spectral features to differentiate between different streaming providers such as Netflix, Youtube, Amazon Prime, Twitch, and Youtube Live. The model achieves an accuracy of 96.5% in provider classification using a Random Forest Classifier. The paper also provides insights into the network patterns and characteristics of each streaming provider. However, there are limitations to the model's performance, particularly in accurately classifying Amazon Prime data. The paper concludes by discussing the ethical implications of tracking individuals' streaming data usage and suggests potential applications for ISPs in optimizing streaming experiences for clients over VPN connections."

Layerwise Relevance Propagation
Alex Y. Luo and Yue Xiao
University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA
(Dated: March 8, 2021)
ABSTRACT : While graph interaction networks achieve exceptional results in Higgs boson iden-
tication, GNN explainer methodology is still in its infancy. To introduce GNN interpretation to
the particle physics domain, we apply layerwise relevance propagation (LRP) to our existing Higgs
boson interaction network (HIN) to calculate relevance scores and reveal what features, nodes, and
connections are most inuential in prediction. We call this application HIN-LRP. The synergy be-
tween the LRP interpretation and the inherent structure of the HIN is such that HIN-LRP is able
to illuminate which particles and particle features in a given jet are most signicant in Higgs boson
identication. The resulting interpretations are ultimately congruent with extant particle physics
theory, with the model demonstrably learning the importance of concepts like the presence of muons,
characteristics of secondary decay, and salient features such as impact parameter and momentum.
I. INTRODUCTION
Graph neural networks (GNN) are notoriously dicult
to interpret [1 and 2], and those employed in the particle
physics domain are no dierent. The graph interaction
network has gained popularity with high energy physi-
cists studying fundamental particles because this graph
model achieves a highly competitive accuracy, while still
working with relatively simple and unprocessed data [3].
However, it is often not fully understood how or why the
Graph Interaction Networks make their classications,
or how these models' inner workings might relate to the
physical properties of the universe.
The Higgs boson interaction network (HIN) is one such
model that we seek to apply the latest research in graph
explaining to. The purpose of the HIN is to determine
whether or not a given jet, or spray of particles, decayed
from a Higgs boson. The implementation examined in
this paper is a simplied version of the HIN created in
\Interaction networks for the identication of boosted
H!bbdecays"" [3].
Our HIN intakes one graph input and is trained solely
on track/particle level features. The graph input repre-
sents a single jet instance, where each of the fully con-
nected nodes is a particle, as in Figure 1. As an output,
the HIN returns a classication: whether or not the ori-
gin of the jet decay was the elusive Higgs boson, or simply
background noise. Specically, the HIN is trained on a
particular permutation of the Higgs boson decay known
asH!bb, where the Higgs boson decays into b hadrons.
We seek to use layerwise relevance propagation (LRP)
to explain the decision making process of the HIN.
LRP can interpret even highly complex deep learning
networks with a strategic application of propagation
rules based on deep Taylor expansion [4].
FIG. 1. Feature values X1,X2, etc. are regrouped under
nodes such that one node is a particle, connected with direc-
tional edge weights.
Historically, LRP has been advertised as a way to
nd and eliminate arbitrary or extraneous features
in a complex neural network. However, with respect
to our HIN, we are specically interested in how the
LRP can reveal the most important nodes and edges
for predictions, which would essentially represent the
individual particle importance as well as the particle-
particle relationships that are particularly representative
of Higgs boson decay, at least to the HIN model. That
is to say, it is very possible that we would see known
physics phenomena reected in the decision making of
the Higgs boson interaction network.
II. RELATED WORK
GNN interpretation is a relatively new domain, largely
kicked o by GNNExplainer in 2019, an interpretation
methodology that approached the problem by taking a
GNN and returning a salient graph substructure and
its most inuential node features [1]. We considered
this a strong candidate for our model for a time, but
were ultimately uncertain about how GNNExplainer's
substructure strategy would react to a fully connected
interaction network with essentially no preordained
substructures. PGExplainer builds o of GNNExplainer2

conceptually, with an additional focus on creating
a heuristic for generalized model analysis instead of
instance based analysis [2]. We feel that, like GN-
NExplainer, this also model has merit|but ultimately,
among several other emerging options for GNN interpre-
tation, we decided to look in the direction of layerwise
relevance propagation.
Layerwise relevance propagation is actually a broader
technique that has existed outside of the GNN context
and has successfully been used to analyze a variety of
model types, particularly convolutional neural networks
[4]. More recently, LRP has been applied in the context
of GNNs, such as in the case of GNN-LRP, which
optimizes LRP for GNNs by holistically analyzing graph
pathways, or \relevant walks"" [5]. LRP has also seen
usage in the chemistry domain, where it is implemented
on a similar \InteractionNet"" GNN to ours, except
instead of particle relationships it focuses on molecular
structures where edges are bonds [6].
Jet tagging uses machine learning to help classify parti-
cle collision events in an ecient and automated way. For
a time, the success of these models depended on train-
ing with specially crafted features, where physics domainexpertise plays a substantial role in aggregating and pri-
oritizing useful information for the neural networks. The
interaction network we explore here is notable for nding
success training on more fundamental level features, par-
ticularly in the case of Higgs boson classication [3]. As
far as jet tagging is concerned, layerwise relevance propa-
gation has been used on CNNs and RNNs (convolutional
and recurrent, respectively) in the particle physics do-
main [7], but less so for GNNs. As such, our goal is
to make that step by applying LRP to the Higgs boson
interaction network in this paper.
III. HIGGS BOSON INTERACTION NETWORK
The Higgs boson interaction network, or HIN, is
programmed using PyTorch Geometric, which is a
streamlined package specically meant for GNN imple-
mentation [8]. PyTorch Geometric simplies both the
creation of the particle-particle interaction graphs and
the training of the model itself. Jet entries in the data
are comprised of track level features, tracks being the
reconstructed pathways and measurements for a given
particle. When the track features are adapted for the
GNN, each jet level entry becomes a particle-particle3

The dash line in red serves as a baseline reference.
interaction graph representing the relationships of every
particle to all other particles in the graph bidirectionally.
Every track gets its own node, and for each track, the
features are regrouped under the corresponding node.
Broadly, graph models are desirable for jet represen-
tation because they reect the absence of an inherit
ordering in the jets.
After processing the data into graphs, we use PyTorch
Geometric to train the GNN by passing the data through
three function blocks: and edge block, node block, and
global block. As in Figure 2, the model's forward
propagation adjusts corresponding edge weights, node
weights, and global weights in each block in accordance
with encoded transformation sequences: concatenations,
linear transformations, batch normalizations, and ReLU
activations. These transformation functions constitute
the pathways that LRP will backpropagate across in
order to acquire relevancy scores, which we will elaborate
upon in the next section.
As seen in Figure 3, the interaction network performs
exceptionally well, with a 99.0% AUC. This is what we
would hope to see from what has experimentally yielded
some of the best performance for Higgs boson identi-
cation thus far [3]. However, we still need layerwise
relevance propagation to uncover how exactly the HIN
is accomplishing such invaluable performance.
See Appendix A for additional context for the model
training.IV. LAYERWISE RELEVANCE PROPAGATION
LRP essentially redistributes relevance scores back-
ward, starting from the model output, passing through
the layers, all the way to the input. Each layer's rele-
vance score is propagated from the layers closest to out-
put, through the hidden connections, to the current layer,
and at each juncture such the sum of the relevance score
is kept approximately the same. The foundation of LRP
is built o of deep taylor expansion, taking gradients at
each layer to deduce activation with respect to the fol-
lowing layer. Because LRP traverses the entire model,
we can calculate relevancy for every edge, every node,
every node feature, and more.
A. Conservation Law
The ow of the relevance scores as it is backpropagated
is analogous to the ow of water in a river: the total
amount is conserved as it ows through the forks. This
is described as a conservation property for LRP [4]. As
such, the partial relevance scores ultimately attributed
to the raw input from dierent paths should be directly
summed up to approximate the actual prediction score
of the output.
There is a distinction to acknowledge in applying
LRP to GNNs, such as our Interaction Network, as
opposed to other deep learning frameworks, like CNNs.
Other models have a more straightforward layer by layer
propagation, whereas the HIN re-propagates certain
layers, particularly the input and the input source
node transformation, reapplying those values in multiple
instances across the block layers (see the blue highlighted
pathways in Figure 2). This can be thought of as a
weight sharing, and it aects the consideration of the
conservation property. Namely, LRP backpropagation
reaches the input from multiple pathways, and each
occurrence must be considered in the conservation
calculations.
Figure 4 depicts an example of one backpropagation
step in LRP. For an arbitrary node in Layer j, call itvj,
it receives the relevance scores from all the nodes that
connects to it from the layer kthat follows it. Hidden
layerk, like other layers, draws from the output of an ad-
jacent layer in activation from layer j, but unlike other
layers, also pulls from the raw input. Thus, when propa-
gating the relevance score through the model backwards,
the relevance score Rkis split into two parts, R0
kand
Rsrc, among which R0
kows into layer jand the other
layers beneath it, and Rsrcis attributed directly to the
input.4
FIG. 4. Relevance propagation from Layer kbackwards into
Layerjand input. In the forward pass k sources from both
Layerjand the input, so the relevance propagation would
work accordingly. Intuitively, Rk=R0
k+Rsrc
B. LRP- 
LRP methodology provides several propagation rules
that are outlined in \Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation:
An Overview"" [4]. In the case of the HIN, we apply
a variant of the LRP- rule uniformly on the layers in
our model, layers which can be roughly divided into
two types: simple linear layers, and normalized rectied
linear layers. For example, in our LRP propagation,
edge mlp 3 is one of the simple linear layers; on the
other hand, edge mlp 0 is joined with the nonlinear
operation(batch normalization followed by ReLU
activation) into a normalized rectied linear layer.
Denote the relevance score of node viin layerjas
(Rj)i, which can be computed as a proportion of the
relevance score from the following layer, layer k. As
shown, the amount of contribution can be conveniently
computed by a forward pass. The LRP- rule for a given
layer is as follows:
(Rj)i=X
u;9(i;u)(ajwT
j)iu(Rk)u
0+P
u(ajwT
j)iu+bj
where0=sign(X
u(ajwT
j)iu+bj)
Here ajstands for the input at layer j,wjandbj
respectively stand for the weight and bias at layer j.
is introduced in the denominator with an appropriate
sign to absorb some of the relevance score as well as to
prevent division by zero, in accordance with the epsilon
rule. Bold typeface indicates when the variables are
tensors instead of scalars.
The proportion calculated in the LRP- rule follows a
\gradientinput"" convention to nd out how each part
of the input contributes to the layer activation, by com-
puting by the product of the layer input and the partial
derivative of the layer output with respect to the layer
input. The partial derivative of the layer output can be
viewed as \the rate of contribution to the activation"" and
thus the product can be viewed as the particular amountof contribution of the part of input towards the layer ac-
tivation. For an arbitrary linear layer j, represented as a

C. Node and Edge Relevance
Following the paths illustrated in Figure 2 backwards,
we can obtain several partial relevance scores from layers
node mlp 2.0 ,node mlp 1.0 , and edge mlp 0 , which
we denote R0
input;R0
src;Rsrc;destrespectively. While the
partial relevance score R0
input from node mlp 2.0 is di-
rectly attributed to the raw input, the scores attained
from node mlp 1.0 and edge mlp 0 correspond to the
relevance of the edges. Thus, the edge relevance score
can be obtained by aggregating R0
srcandRsrc;dest. To
quantify the relative relevancy of each edge in a particu-
lar jet graph to the classication, we introduce the edge
signicance, Sedge, computed as follows:
LetRedge=Rsrc;dest+ [R0
src;In(n 1)];
8i2[0;n(n 1)];(Sedge)i=jj(Redge)ijjFP
j(Sedge)j:
Here Redge is a matrix with dimension
(n(n 1);48 + 48), in which the rst 48 columns
are source node features of the directed edge and the
last 48 columns are destination node features. The idea
ofSedgeis to measure the importance of the edge by the
amount of information ow through it in the decision
making process.
The node relevance map Rnode can be computed by
joining the edge relevance scores with the partial input
relevance score. To attribute relevance score for each
node feature, the edge relevance scores are aggregated
by taking the mean with respect to their corresponding
nodes:
Rnode=R0
input
+scatter mean (R0
src;src)
+scatter mean (Rsrc,dest [:;: 48];src)
+scatter mean (Rsrc,dest [:;48 :];dest )
Here srcand dest are the node indices of the source
and destination node of the directed edge.5
FIG. 5. Rnodeheat map of IN trained on dummy input. Note
that the relevance scores are concentrated in the 4th column,
which corresponds to feature 3
D. LRP Dummy Model
To verify the validity and to evaluate the primary
output, Rnode, we designed the LRP dummy model.
The dummy model has the exact same architecture as
our HIN, but is trained on synthesized data instead.
The synthesized dummy data mimics the actual data,
with 48 features and a xed number of 10 tracks per
jet. The entries of all features except feature 0 and 3 are
all meaningless Gaussian noise with mean set to 0 and
standard deviation set to 1. Feature 0 and 3 are designed
to represent meaningful measurements, taking up values
inf0;10gandf 20; 10;0;10grespectively. The label y
of each jet is computed as following,
y= sign(1
109X
i=0feature 0+ 2feature 3)
Notice that even though feature 0is involved in the
formula, it is completely dominated by the value of
feature 3. Therefore, we would reasonably expect to see
thatRnode should have large magnitudes at column 3
only. Figure 5 shows that we are able to capture the
contribution of feature 3to the prediction, with a rea-
sonably small amount of noise.
V. RESULTS
The biggest question of this project is whether or not
the application of layerwise relevance propagation would
bear fruit when applied to the Higgs boson interaction
network. The specic goal is that on a case by case ex-
amination of inputs, we can understand the physics con-
cepts that the HIN is determining to be most valuable.
We explore validity of layerwise relevance propagation's
interpretation of the Higgs boson interaction network in
HIN-LRP.
A. HIN-LRP
Since LRP is applied on an instance level, it gives us
GNN analysis on a jet by jet basis. So for our HIN, weget a relevance map that corresponds directly to the
shape and values of a given jet input. And thanks to
the organization of the jet graph input, the HIN-LRP
interpretation of a jet essentially enumerates exactly
which particles and aspects of those particles are most
important to whether it is a Higgs boson signal.
We present the interpretation result of each jet as a
pair visualization of with a heat map and a 3D network
plot. The heat map plots a saliency matrix such that
every individual input relevance score is clearly laid
out. The tracks are left to right ordered by increasing
momentum ( track pt). The more intense the color in
a cell the more relevant that entry of the input is to
the Higgs probability output. Notably, positive and
negative activation is not responsible for corresponding
positive and negative Higgs signal labeling, all magni-
tudes are signicant. The 3D plot is a combination of
physical space on the xy plane with polar-esque values
oftrack phirel and track etarel , with momentum
once more on the z axis. Here, the relevance of a node
is summarized by the norm of its features and depicted
with size. The edge signicance Sedgeis highlighted in
red above a threshold of relevance and a simple gray
below, with a low uniform color intensity.
Momentum plays a major role, tying the readability
of the graphs together, because it is well known that
high momentum particles are often representative of a
jet's character. And indeed, it is often the case that
high momentum particles are associated with high
relevance scores. Momentum sort is present in the axes
of both plots to unify the sense of which particles and
connections are most responsible for the classications.
The LRP visualizations show a promising correlation
to what is understood about the physics behind Higgs
boson to b hadron decay. Many of the graphs are
activated along two columns, which may suggest that
the HIN is recognizing two major prongs in the jet, po-
tentially representing the paths of each b hadron. When
a given input is highly dependent on a single feature, it
is often what a physicist would expect to be important:
momentum, impact parameter, energy level. The
model even recognizes the importance of electrons and
muons|since these are frequently present in the decay of
the b hadron, there is a good chance that a Higgs boson
too may have been involved. These concepts are well
understood by domain experts, but it is only with HIN-
LRP that we can see through the eyes of the model itself.
Below, we have selected just 4 jets (among millions)
that the HIN is most condent in labeling as Higgs
boson signals to interpret and visualize below, in order
to connect the major driving forces for the model's
decisions with physics theory.

B. Visualizations
Figure 6 and 7 show the interpretation result of
selected jet 1, for which the model is more than 99 :9%
condent in its prediction. The colored cells are mostly
distributed in columns 14 and 21, suggesting that those
two nodes are most relevant to the prediction. This
aligns with the intuition that the model is perceiving
the two pronged nature of Higgs bosons decaying into
2 b hadrons. Note how the highest momentum node
is the most important, and in the 3D space we see the
edge connecting to this node to be highly activated.
Physicists have shown that Higgs boson decay products
are likely to have larger transverse momentum value
relative to the jet axis [9].
Figure 8 has all the relevance scores attributed among
only two columns, again alluding to the two pronged
decay into b hadrons. In other words, those two particles
are the most signicant nodes in the prediction, some-
thing that is clearly armed in Figure 9's 3D plotting.
Notably, it is the lower momentum tracks in this jet that
are more responsible for classication, but even in this
situation momentum itself is a highly relevant feature.
Figures 10 and 11 show the interpretation result of
a Higgs boson jet that the model believes with 99 :9%
condence is a signal. Note that in bottom right of
Figure 10, the cell corresponding to node 19 and feature
track isMu is colored a rather dark shade of blue, sug-
gesting that this entry has been particularly important
for the model to classify the jet as a signal. A quick
examination of the raw data shows that the entry is 1
in the corresponding position, meaning that node 19 is
a muon. This matches with the theoretical expectation
that the presence of a muon among the decay products
is a strong indicator of the jet being related to a Higgs
boson [9].
Figure 12 shows how, in track 19, the HIN utilizes a
host of positional information like momentum, track pt,
angle from jet ( track DeltaR ,track EtaRel ), angle
from secondary vertex ( track drminsv ), all to classify
the Higgs boson sginal with great condence. Alongside
this positional information in track 19 is the boolean for
whether the track is ""pileup-like"", or more colloquially,
an intrusive track from separate jet decay. This indicates
that the model understands that the aforementioned po-
sitional features are only helpful given that this track is
actually native to the jet being analyzed. In track 18, the
binary feature track isEl is also hugely important for
making the classication decision. track isEl encodes
whether the given particle is an electron, which, similar
to muons, is a strong indicator of the jet being related to
a Higgs boson when it is present [9].VI. CONCLUSION
We presented a specic way to interpret the inner
workings of the Higgs boson interaction network through
layerwise relevance propagation, and have found that
the methodology does, to a signicant extent, reect
the foundations of theoretical physics that the model is
trained on. With a simple application of just the LRP- 
rule, we now have the ability to visualize the relevance
of any given jet graph input with respect to how likely it
is to be a Higgs boson signal. Our implementation code
can be found here [10].
The Higgs boson interaction network itself was trained
on a simulated dataset from the CMS Collaboration's
Open Data Portal. It was implemented with PyTorch
Geometric and directly built from prior work establish-
ing the primacy of interaction networks for Higgs boson
signal classication [3].
This is rst and foremost a foray into LRP GNN in-
terpretation for a hyper specic purpose: Higgs bosons
decaying into b hadrons. HIN-LRP successfully asserts
the value of layerwise relevance propagation for providing
transparency regarding how well GNNs perceive the rules
governing particle collision and decay. Our techniques
can potentially be applied to more deeply understand a
model, optimize or reduce features necessary for train-
ing, and, within the particle physics domain, thoroughly
compare the essence of varied jet inputs. HIN-LRP could
benet greatly from a way to generalize the results across
the millions of jet entries to paint a bigger picture. All
said, GNN interpretation is constantly innovating, and
the tactics we have outlined can be further rened along-
side the latest methodologies|varied LRP rules [4], gen-
eralization heuristics [2], relevant walks [5]|to gain an
even deeper understanding of how deep learning comes
to understand the laws of physics.

simulation data. The CMS collaboration simulates col-
lision events in a ground up fashion based on conrmed
physics theory [11]. A benet of this is that we can also
lessen the rarity of the Higgs boson signal, such that it's
actually useful to train this model. After many events
are generated with the simulators, the most relevant
jets are ltered through with a particle-ow algorithm
that removes a certain amount of collision noise. Sim-
ulations are the preferred training data because the
LHC produces approximately 10 quadrillion collisions
per year, resulting in petabyte level amounts of particle
data that are impractical to train on. Additionally,
the actual data has an extremely imbalanced class
ratio (approximately 99 to 1), as the Higgs boson is an
extremely rare occurrence in real collision events.
Training models on the actual data would potentially
result in a model with high accuracy, but low precision.
Also, by using simulated data, we can concentrate
solely on jets, because the actual LHC data often seeks
to observe many other kinds of data. With all these
considerations, we sourced the simulated data from the
CERN Open Data Portal, and pulled out approximately
3 million jet entries. The particular Higgs boson event
we draw from is the decay into b hadron pairs ( H!bb),
with background collision noise (QCD).
The Interaction Network ultimately trained on approx-
imately 2 million jet entries, and evaluated on a ran-
dom subset of 128000 jets due to time complexity. IN
is trained with batch size of 128 jet particle-particle in-
teraction graphs for 10000 minibatches per epoch (20%
of the mini batches are put aside for validation purpose)
with Adam optimizer and an initial learning rate of 10-4.
We had planned for 150 epochs for the model with early
stopping, but it actually converged quickly to a desirable
result in less than 10 epochs.

itated heavily by PyTorch Geometric abstraction, and

Appendix C: Project Proposal
Deep learning (DL) has commonly been regarded
as a black box. By black box, we mean that we lack
full understanding of how it works, despite knowing
that it can produce outstanding performance. After
implementing a successful GNN classier for identifying
Higgs bosons, we are left wondering how exactly our
model makes the decisions. While there is an awareness
in the physics domain that mass and momentum are
large factors, it is dicult to understand concretely how
the graphs weigh the features, especially since the more
commonly understood features are usually decorrelated.
We can look at the very model we just created, and
with the same data, see if we can explain the model's
understanding of Higgs boson jets. Is there potential
for furthering the physics domain's understanding of the
problem by explaining the model's composition?
This approach to deep learning is not exclusive to
particle physics, it also applies to general applications
of DL in dierent elds. Explainable DL models are
becoming more and more popular recently, as people
begin to notice its potential to understand various
problems when the neural network's structure is more
transparent.
Deep learning is still quite new, and deep learning
interpretability is even newer, but quite a lot research
has been done to interpret deep learning models. Many
papers have already been written on understanding
CNNs through the visualization of the network's ac-
tivation, producing images that peel back the curtain
on the neural net's mind. Unfortunately, we have
far less understanding of how GNN works|the graph10
representation of the hidden layers are not as intuitively
visualizable as feature maps of images in CNNs. And so
we lack a comprehensive explanation of the Interaction
Network we implemented for jet identication.
We know that a major advantage of IN is its ability to
learn from low level features that are closer to the raw
measurements from the collider, i.e. it does not depend
as much on expert knowledge as the previously used clas-
sical ML solutions. We propose that by understanding a
trained IN, we could potentially gain more insight into
both the physics problem itself and possible direction
for further improvement of the model. We hypothesize
that we could render a \most signal looking input"" or
the graph that our model most strongly associates with
the Higgs to b hadron decay.
Instead of studying a general question on how to
explain the behavior of graph nets, we want to focus on
the interpretation of the GNN based IN. A unique and
good thing about studying IN is that, unlike many other
GNNs, we have a rough expectation on its behavior
based on existing particle physics theories. Probing intoa trained IN, we expect to see that it actually learns
the expert crafted variables from the raw input data,
and it learns to distinguish the signicance of dierent
features; we also expect to discover something new or
unexpected about the interaction of certain low level
features. There is a potential to perceive actual physics
phenomena by understanding how the GNN gets trained
in a more coherent way.
Though explaining GNN is a relatively untapped mar-
ket, there are plenty of new and exciting reference points
for us to reasonably build from. There is a long history
of visualizing jets with image abstractions, so the hy-
pothetical \most signal input"" would have a straightfor-
ward extant visualization method. PyTorch Geometric
does provide avenues to explain GNNs based on a paper
that highlights and visualizes the most activated subsets
of GNNs, which would synergize nicely with our exist-
ing PyTorch model. And just the other week a physics
domain related paper was published about \Explainable
AI for ML jet taggers using expert variables and layer-
wise relevance propagation"" [7], which closely relates to
the classical ML model we implemented with XGBoost
in our replication.

Abstract
As data scientists, we are often driven toward those
domains which generate vast amounts of data. High-
energy physics is no exception. The Large Hadron Col-
lider (LHC) alone produces around 90 petabytes of data
per year (roughly 240 terabytes per day). As such, there
are thousands upon thousands of researchers combing
through the LHC’s particle interactions to draw conclu-
sions. But, there exists one major difﬁculty in doing so:
the colliders themselves only have instruments that can
detect physical quantities (energies, momentums, and the
like). The LHC simulates particle collisions that result
in a spray of subatomic particles called jets. Considering
the many categories of jets (Higgs boson, singly charmed
quarks, etc.), classiﬁcation of jets must be conducted out-
side of the LHC by researchers and their algorithms.
We implement multiple multiclass classiﬁers (CNN,
GNN, ENN) to discriminate between six types of jets
which may occur. While a similar classiﬁer exists at the
LHC, the ceiling for improvement extends higher with
each advancement in machine learning- deep neural net-
work architecture being the most recent. In implement-
ing our own neural network, we strive to achieve a higher
level of model performance.
1 Introduction
In order for there to be study of subatomic particles,
and indeed for any knowledge to be gained about the
quantum world at all, physicists must use particle collid-
ers. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN produces
data on the order of ﬁfty petabytes a year (expected to in-
crease further with newer updates to the collider), making
high energy physics (HEP) data very appealing for data
scientists like ourselves. These devices accelerate oppos-
ing beams of protons along a track until they collide with
velocities just shy of the speed of light. The impact then
forces each proton in the collision to scatter into the sub-atomic, elementary particles which compose it. This re-
sulting spray of quarks, leptons, and bosons decay in a
cone-shaped pattern referred to as a jet.
One of the limitations of particle colliders lies in the
fact that there does not currently exist a magical device
capable of simply detecting the presence of speciﬁc vari-
eties of particles. Any determination of particle type and
trajectory must be extrapolated from the detector’s phys-
ical measurements. As each research team working with
the data has a separate goal, whether it be to investigate
the potential conditions of the early universe or the na-
ture of the Higgs ﬁeld and nature of matter as a whole,
they will want to classify different types of particle jets.
Drawing on past work [1] creating a neural network clas-
siﬁer to detect the presence of Higgs boson jets, we set
out to create a multiclass classiﬁer for six categories of
jets representing different decay patterns of elementary
particles.
The data collected represents fully simulated LHC
collision events, released by the CMS Collaboration on
the CERN Open Data portal [2]. These provided simu-
lations allow for a more intrinsic, realistic comparison of
machine learning methods on high-energy physics experi-
ments. Considering our goal is to distinguish six different
categories of particle jets from proton-proton collisions
(H→bb, QCD→b, QCD→bb, QCD→c, QCD→cc, and
QCD other), we particularly focus on the features repre-
senting jets (Fig 1).
Our dataset then provides metrics concerning the jet
overall, individual tracks of particles within that jet, and
any secondary vertices (locations from which particle
tracks originate which are not the point of collision)
which may be present. In total, there are 172 features
for us to pick from when doing our analysis, of which 74
are speciﬁcally about the jet as a whole. Some key fea-
tures that we are concerned with include number of tracks
in a jet, the angles which deﬁne the physical morphology
of the jet, number of secondary vertices present, and thedistance between the primary vertex and any secondary
vertices present.

2 Method
In our initial exploration, we used a convolutional
neural network developed by the CMS Collaboration as
a basis for creating a H →bb jet classiﬁer of our own.
Our replication followed similar model architecture to the
original but with some slight variations. The ﬁnal model
uses 48 track features for up to 60 charged particles to
draw conclusions. As this classiﬁer was fairly competent
at discriminating between those jets which contained a
H→bb decay and those that did not, we adapted this to be
our ﬁrst multi class classiﬁer.
This model utilizes the Conv1D layer of Keras,
adding multiple 1D convolutional layers. Essentially,
we are applying the Deep Sets [3] architecture to jets,
known as the particle-ﬂow network [4] approach. After
batch normalization [5] on the input data, the features are
passed to 3 separate one-dimensional convolution layers
which build upon each other sequentially. The number of
nodes in each layer are 64, 32, and 32, respectively. The
outputs of these nodes are average pooled and then sent
to a hidden dense layer with 100 nodes. This is ﬁnally
passed to a ﬁnal fully connected layer with 2 nodes which
classiﬁes the jet with a softmax activation function. All
layers before this had ReLU [6] activations. As a base-
line, we compare this against a naive, fully-connected,
dense neural network. We refrain from using this archi-
tecture to make a ﬁnal model with, as these kinds of fully
connected neural networks are prone to overﬁtting.
Performing multi class classiﬁcation is hindered often
by the imbalance in class representation in the data. This
is very much the case with our work, as should be evident
from the distribution of class representation from our ex-
ploratory data analysis (Fig 2), as well as the results ofthe convolutional model prior to class balancing (Fig 3).
Figure 2. Distribution of class representation in our
dataset
To correct this, balanced class weights were calcu-
lated following the formula below:
wi=number of jets
number of classes ·number of jets in class i
With the inclusion of these weights applied to each
class of particle jets that we concern ourselves with, the
model greatly increases its performance (Fig 4).
In addition to modifying our previous model, we
sought to investigate whether different model architec-
tures would be more appropriate for our task. To more
robustly determine the best architecture for multi classiﬁ-
cation on this dataset, we looked to other kinds of neural
networks. We continued to tune our convolutional neural
network (CNN) model, but upon further investigation, we
decided to compare this model against an implementation
of a graph neural network (GNN) [7].
The GNN model that we are extending to implement a
multiclass classiﬁcation feature is an interaction network
to model the particle-particle interactions. The model
takes in 48 track features and utilizes batch normalization
layers to help stabilize the training. The GNN we im-
plemented contains 3 update functions and 3 aggregation
functions. Each update and aggregation function pair will
make up the process of a single graph network (GN) block
including: edge block, node block, and global block. The
edge block is used to update the edge features from the in-
put and receiver nodes. The node block is used to update
the edges and the global block is used to set the output
nodes.103

3 Results
We successfully added a multiclass classiﬁcation fea-
ture to two deep learning models: 1 dimensional convolu-
tional neural network (Conv1d) and graph neural network
(GNN), producing predictions that classify each of the 6
different categories of jets. As a baseline when training
the models on only one training ﬁle while also neglect-
ing the skewed distribution of data, we can identify poor
performances by the models.
For the Dense and Conv1d models, we noticed major
improvements from previously unfavorable classiﬁcation
performances after feeding the models multiple training
ﬁles and balancing the class weights. The largest im-
provement can be identiﬁed as the Higgs boson jet, im-proving from 86.5% to 96.5%.
Regarding the GNN, the baseline model without the
jets performs fairly well without accounting for the class
weights. Upon trying to improve its performance, using
class weights proved to be difﬁcult. Although weights
were calculated identically for the Dense and Conv1d
models, incorporating class weights in the GNN did not
signiﬁcantly affect performance. This feature is still be-
ing tested for improvement and will be resolved using
more resources in the future.
4 Conclusion
Across the 3 models, the jet category with the most
data had the best performances from all the models. For103

instance, the Higgs boson had an AUC of 96.5%, along
with a higher percentage of data points compared to the
others. This further shows the hurdle caused by the im-
balance in data across the 6 jet classes. Although Higgs
boson also didn’t have too much representation in the data
its unique quality that outshined the other jet classes is
what we hypothesize causes us to be able to classify it
with high accuracy.
Discriminating between the different jets is already
a difﬁcult task. While the Higgs boson has more distin-
guishable features, other jets have close similarities, like
the two charmed quarks with the two bottom quarks and
the single charmed quarks with the single bottom quarks.
These minimal differences most likely contribute to the
poor classiﬁcation performances on top of the lack ofdata.
Understanding the inner workings of new neural net-
works was a major difﬁculty we faced. In order to debug
the code for the GNN model, we required research and
mentorship. Even so, some issues, such as the lack of sig-
niﬁcant improvement when implementing class weights
for the model, were left unresolved for the time being.
In the future, we would have liked to implement an
Equivariant Neural Network (ENN). ENNs are similar to
graph networks, with the additional feature of respecting
the symmetry in physics, a very important characteristic
in particle jet classiﬁcation. However, ENNs are not as
widely used as CNNs or GNNs, resulting in fewer re-
sources to reference for implementation. Given a larger
time frame, we would like to compare a baseline ENN toour existing models.
Our goal was to explore deep learning multiclassiﬁ-
cation techniques for classifying 6 different categories of
particle jets, comparing several possible baseline models
for jet tagging. By building a multi classiﬁer, we simplify
the process from creating individual classiﬁers for each
jet to one large model. In doing so, we make an already
tedious task more efﬁcient. This project can be used as a
stepping stone for future projects in the intricate world of
particle physics.

Overview
RTL Wastewater Sampling Project on UCSD 
What started out as a small sampling process in which a handful of samples were 
collected from manholes at specific locations around campus became the leading 
indicator of forecasting COVID-19 cases. The scope of the monitoring covers over 
7000 students in 239 different buildings on campus. Upon detection, students are 
notified of exposures by means of the wastewater notification program, where specific 
students in specific buildings were informed of exposure and ultimately tested and 
isolated quickly and effectively if needed. There were a ton of bottlenecks regarding 
the sampling process, eventually, the sampling process was assisted heavily by 
automation, and the turn-around time for the sampling was 4.5 hours from sampling 
collection at each manhole to automated data reporting and notification. For scale, all 
of NYC has 15 robot manhole sampling locations while UCSD has over 200 sampling 
locations. 
Although informative, this time-lagged correlation alone is not enough 
for robust predictions. Instead, this served as the main motivation to 
build a predictive model for forecasting the number of new cases per day 
in San Diego County .

Abstract
In genomics we ar e often faced with the task to identify
genes corr elated with a specific
disease among a large number  of candidate gene pools.
One appr oach is to apply a
hypothesis test to every individual gene. For  this
model to work, we need to adjust for
additional variance caused by unknown confounding
factors. We also need to contr ol the

will intr oduce a r obust version of this
method primarily using estimations of the empirical

Introduction
In genetic research, we are often interested in searching
for significant genes that are
correlated with a certain type of disease from a lar ge
pool of candidates. This is known as the
genome-wide association studies (GW AS). To do this,
often two approaches are used. The first
approach involves applying statistical tests to every
single gene. To do this, we must adjust for
additional variances, caused by unknown confounding
factors,  in the data empirically .
Furthermore, we must control the level of error rate,
namely the number of false positives.
Normally , a naive approach, such as setting the significance
level
ɑ
to 0.05, will suf fice when the
number of samples is small. However , when we have
large numbers of sample genes, such as
10,000 unique genes, we end up having a lar ge number
of false positives due to randomness.
Therefore, a multiple testing using an empirical null
distribution that adjusts to unknown factors
in the data empirically combined with thresholding
the false discovery rate will suf fice to
provide us with accurate results. A second approach
is the unsupervised clustering method. One
problem with such an approach is that the data often
do not have obviously separable clusters.2
However , in this study , we will apply the method to compare it with the multiple testing
approach.
The multiple testing method is achieved through simultaneously
conducting a lar ge
number of hypothesis tests between the control and
experimental groups on each individual gene.
With each hypothesis test’ s t-statistics recorded,
we can search through the data for anomalies
and identify genes that might be correlated with the
disease of our interest. Notably , we will use
both a theoretical null distribution, N(0,1),  and
an empirical null distribution that adjusts to the
data empirically . We hypothesize that the empirical
null distribution will provide a better fit for
the data as well as more accurate results than the
theoretical null distribution. For the clustering
methods, we will mainly use k-Means as well as the
Gaussian Mixture Models.
In this paper , we will apply the methods with a dataset
on leukemia studies. This dataset,
collected by Harvard Professor of Pediatrics, Todd
Golub, consists of the gene expressions of
more than six thousand dif ferent genes from a mixture
sample of seventy-two
patients with either
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL). Our task is to identify
genes that dif ferentiate the two types of leukemia.
The original dataset was separated into a
training set and a testing set for model building
purposes.
We will use both an empirical null
distribution as well as a theoretical null distribution;
however , we hypothesize that the empirical
null distribution would provide more accurate results
than the theoretical null distribution. This is
because as our data is skewed, a theoretical null
distribution will not represent our data well;
instead an empirical null distribution, one that is
obtained from first observing the data and
estimating the fraction of each component of the mixture
model’ s distribution, can better
represent our data and give more accurate results.
Furthermore, after computing the t-statistics,
we will threshold by controlling the false discovery
rate (FDR).
To test the ef fects of the multiple testing analysis,
we will also apply machine learning
models to the same dataset. Since our data is unlabeled,
we will use unsupervised classification
models such as k-Means and the Gaussian Mixture model.
We will compare and contrast the
results from the clustering models to those obtained
from multiple testing analysis. We
hypothesize that
naive classification models fall
short when using lar ge scale data.
Theory and Methods
Quantile T ransformation3
After some exploratory data analysis on the leukemia dataset, we discovered that the two
groups, patients with AML  and patients with ALL, have
different variances across the dataset.
This appears to be an issue for our hypothesis testing
procedure, as the t-test function in R
applies Welch’ s t-test using approximation to the
degrees of freedom in case of unequal
variances between two groups. Since the degrees of
freedom varies among samples, we must
apply a quantile transformation on the t-statistics
in order to obtain uniform distribution across
our data.
To do this we found the areas (or probabilities)
of each t statistic and their respective z
scores in a normal distribution. We used the R function
pt()
to get the areas. The
pt()
function
takes in a t-statistic and the number of degrees of
freedom and returns the area below that t-value
to the upper -tail. We wanted to find the lower -tail
areas so we used
1 - pt()
and input our set of
t-scores and respective degrees of freedom for each
score. Then we used the
qnorm
function to
get the corresponding z scores for each area. The
qnorm
function takes the lower -tailed area and
returns the corresponding z-value, hence why we wanted
the lower -tailed areas from
pt
. After we
input our areas we are now left with a normal distribution
of z-scores that will allow us to use the
empirical null distribution.
Mixtur e Model
We will use a two-class mixture model for our study .
This is a simplification of the
problem. In reality , a gene can be expressive in one
of the two types of leukemia, expressive in
both, and expressive in neither . However , for the
purpose of our study here, we will use a
simplified model by assuming that there are only two
classes- genes that are expressed
differently in the two types of leukemia and those
that are expressed the same way . We will
estimate the mixture model by estimating the fraction
of true negatives. To do so, we assume that
the data has two sets, S
0
and S
A
, where S
0
denotes
all true negatives and S
A
denotes all true
positives. In our dataset, S
0
represents all genes
that are uncorrelated with dif ferentiating AML
from ALL  while S
A
represents those genes that correlate.
Furthermore, we define
f
0
(z)
and
f
A
(z)
to be the probability distribution of  S
0
and S
A
respectively .
We will estimate the fraction
p
0
of the
number of true negatives over the number of samples
so that the data distribution:
𝑓(𝑡) = 𝑝0𝑓0(𝑧) + (1−𝑝0)𝑓𝐴(𝑧)
(1)4
is close to the  the scaled density ,
within an interval
l
0
around the null distribution mean,𝑝0𝑓0(𝑧)
𝝁
0.
Notably , Efron et al. (2001) discusses that such
application of the empirical null
distribution must reach the following two requirements:
1.
The number of tests, N, must be lar ge.
2.
A large majority of the tests must be within the null
set, S
0
.
Error Metrics
We will use false discovery rate as our threshold
metric for the statistical parametric map.
The false discovery rate is defined as the rate of
type I errors, the ratio between the number of
false positives and the number of predicted positives.
For our study , we set the level of threshold
z
and define
FP(z)
and
TP(z)
to be the number of false
positives and the number of true positives
respectively under the threshold
u
. We will compute
the false discovery rate under threshold
u
as
the following:
].
(2)𝐹𝐷𝑅(𝑧) = 𝐸[𝐹𝑃(𝑧)𝐹𝑃(𝑧) + 𝑇𝑃(𝑧)
We aim to control the threshold
u
to lower the false
discovery rate. Notably , when
u
is
large, we have fewer number of false positives, leading
to a lowered FDR; however , increasing
the threshold
z
also leads to increased false negatives.
Ideally , we want to achieve a set FDR with
the minimum level of threshold
.
To do this, we will
first set a significance level
ɑ
for the FDR
and then calculate the FDR for dif ferent levels of
z
and select the minimum
z
that satisfies the
significance level of FDR
.
To put this in formula,
we want to calculate
.𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑢𝐹𝐷𝑅(𝑧)≤α
(3)
Compared to other thresholding criteria such as
the family-wise error rate (FWER),
which controls the rate of false positives among all
samples, the FDR only controls the rate of
false positives among the positives and therefore
is more permissive of false positives by
definition (Schwartzman et al., 2009). Since our goal
is to identify the genes correlated with
differentiating the AML  from ALL, FDR is preferable
as it allows some false positives as long as
there are way more true positives.
To get a better understanding of our result, we will
also look at the true positive rate
(TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR). The TPR measures
the rate between the number of true5
positives (TP) and the number of true positives plus the number of false negatives (FN). It is
formally written as the following:
].
(4)𝑇𝑃𝑅(𝑧) = 𝐸[𝑇𝑃(𝑧)𝑇𝑃(𝑧) + 𝐹𝑁(𝑧)
The FPR is calculated as the rate between the number
of false positives (FP) and the
number of false positives and true negatives (TN),
or formally as:
].
(5)𝐹𝑃𝑅(𝑧) = 𝐸[𝐹𝑃(𝑧)𝐹𝑃(𝑧) + 𝑇𝑁(𝑧)
Data examples
To illustrate the ef fect of dif ferent null distributions
on multiple testing methods, we will
use leukemia collected by Harard Professor of Pediatrics,
Todd Golub. The dataset consists of
the gene expressions of seventy-two leukemia patients
among which forty-seven of them have
ALL  and twenty-five of them have AML. To compare the
differences between the two groups of
patients, we first conduct a t-test between the ALL
patients and the AML  patients.
Fig.1 shows the histogram of 2,185 t-statistics and
the red line indicates the theoretical
null distribution N(0,1). The figure shows that the
t-statistics are much wider and shorter than the
theoretical null distribution. We also observed that
the t-statistics have a very slight right skew .
To obtain a better fit, we converted the t-statistics
into z-scores and performed quantile
transformation.6
Fig.1. Histogram of the N=2,185 t-statistics (gray)
and the theoretical null distribution (red line).
In Fig.2, we have the histogram of the z-scores after
standardization. It is still wider and
shorter than the theoretical null distribution N(0,1)
but it will suf fice to provide us a meaningful
estimation of the fraction of true negatives,
. To obtain a better fitted null distribution, we
use𝑝0
the
estimation method mentioned in the section
above using an interval of [-0.2, 0.2]. We𝑝0
compute the estimated parameter
= 0.595.
This confirms our previous observation that our𝑝0
histogram is much lower than the theoretical null
and estimates that around 40.5% of the genes
are expressed dif ferently in the two types of leukemia
patients.
After scaling the theoretical null distribution N(0,1)
with
, the theoretical distribution𝑝0
fits the z-scores much better; however , this approach
still does not address the issue of the higher
variance and the skewness of the data. Therefore,
we estimate an empirical null distribution
using the median of the z-scores and an estimated
standard-deviation. Using the interquartile
range (IQR), we estimate the standard deviation
.
Again we estimate theσ=𝐼𝑄𝑅/1.349
parameter
using the method above.
This new estimation suggests that about 6.7% of𝑝0=0.933
the genes are expressed dif ferently between the two
groups, much lower than the 40.5% obtained
7
above. Combine all the result, we have empirical null distribution estimated parameters
,
, and
. The
resulting distribution, observed as the red𝑝0=0.933µ=−0.066σ=1.534
solid line in Fig.2, provides a much better fit of
the data than both the theoretical and scaled
theoretical null distribution. The empirical null
distribution adjusts to the histogram’ s additional
variance due to confounding factors and will provide
more realistic results and estimations of
error rates.

Fig.3 shows the right tail True Positive Rate (TPR),
False Positive Rate (FPR), and False
Discovery Rate (FDR) of the theoretical null distribution
and the empirical null distribution. The
theoretical null distribution is obtained from scaling

with

the likelihood that an actual positive sampleσ=1.534𝑝0= 0.933
produces a positive testing result. In Fig.3a, we
see that the TPR of the empirical null goes above
9
1. This is due to mismatch between the data and the distribution, as observed in Fig.2 the
empirical null distribution goes above the histogram
from around -4 to -2. The FPR indicates the
likelihood of false positives. Lastly , the FDR is
computed in equation (2) as the rate between the
number of FP  and the number of total tested positives
and it computes the rate of type I error .
Fig.3c shows that the theoretical null distribution
yields a FDR curve that conver ges to 0 as the
threshold x increases. Meanwhile, the empirical null
distribution produces a much higher level
FDR than the theoretical null distribution given the
same level of threshold. Moreover , the FDR
curve yielded by the empirical null distribution fails
to conver ge as x increases and is
approximately 0.44 when the threshold is the lar gest
at x = 5.
Discussion
At first, the result from Fig.3c seems to conflict
with our hypothesis that the empirical
null distribution will produce better results than
the theoretical null distribution. While our result
shows that the theoretical null distribution yields
a lower estimated FDR at the same level of
threshold than the empirical null distribution, this
does not necessarily mean that the theoretical
null provides a more accurate result. Since we cannot
know the actual label of the data, there is
no way for us to actually test the accuracy of our
result. What we have is an estimation of the
error rate, which allows us to gain insight into the
likelihood of false positives at each level of
the threshold. The theoretical null distribution yields
an apparent lower error rate, but this result
may be incorrect. This is because that as we have
observed, additional variance in the histogram,
due to confounding factors, will skew the results
of the theoretical null. In contrast, the empirical
null distribution adjusts for those unknown confounding
factors empirically . This results in lower
detection power , as observed from the dif ference in
the estimated parameter
, but the error
rate𝑝0
may be more realistic, meaning it is closer to the
true error rate.1 0

Airborne Infection Risk Estimator for Indoor Environments
By Etienne Doidic, Zhexu Li, and Nicholas Kho
The global pandemic of COVID-19 has demonstrated the exceptional transmissibility of the SARS-
CoV-2 virus and has highlighted the vulnerability of the built environment to airborne pathogens.
Building occupants and operators must now consider the dangers of airborne pathogens and enact
measures to reduce the risk of airborne infection throughout buildings in order to ensure the health
of occupants and the greater public. As buildings today reopen without a vaccine it is vital
to understand the risk of airborne infection based on building features and occupant activity .
It is equally vital for building operators to have detailed risk estimations so they may consider
appropriate airflow for rooms when considering energy consumption. One method that has been
developed to address this situation is the infection risk calculator. These calculators allow users
to input variables such as the number of occupants, room dimensions, air change per hour (ACH),
masks/no masks, etc., in order to determine the risk of infected person(s) transmitting a virus to
susceptible people the room. While these calculators may be convenient in some cases, they are
“black box” algorithms, meaning the underlying code is not accessible or transparent to users. And
with a large amount of skepticism surrounding the academic literature regarding this virus and its
transmission [Scheirer 2020] , we believe it is important infection risk calculators are as transparent
as possible.
In this notebook we describe our methods for developing our own airborne infection risk estimator
for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

10.1 How does it W ork?
T o calculate the risk of infection in a given room, the emmission rate of quanta is needed. A
quantum is defined as the viral load i.e. the dose of contaminated airborne droplet nuclei required
to cause infection in 63% of persons. The emmission rate of quanta is caclulated with the following
formula:
Morawska et al. 2020
Ni is the droplet concentrations by diameter in particles per cubic centimeter. The droplet concen-
trations are dependent on the expiratory activity of the infected person. Droplet concentrations by
diameter were taken from Morawska et al. 2009 . ”Speaking” was considered to be the average of
”singing” and ”counting. ”

cv corresponds to the viral load in the sputum (i.e. infectious mucus) of the infected person,
expressed in RNA copies per mililiter. The viral load in sputum of an infected person varies and is
dependent on the stage of infection [Y u et al. 2020] . A range of 1e5 - 1e9 RNA copies per mililiter
for viral load in the sputum is determined but for this experiment we will choose the maximum
viral load to simulate the worst case scenario for infection spread [W alsh et al. 2020] .
ci is a conversion factor defined as the ratio between one infectious quantum and the infectious dose
expressed in viral RNA copies, expressed in quanta per RNA copies. A survey of ci’s indicates a
range of .01 to .1 but finally a ci of .02 was selected to reflect the average value of the infectious
doses reported in W atanabe et al. 2010 . The study covers SARS-CoV (not to be confused with
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19) but was selected because it provides a more well-
studied report of the infectivity of coronaviruses, which has not possible for SARS-CoV-2 due to
its very recent development.
Inhalation Rate (IR) is the product of breathing rate and tidal volume, expressed in cubic meters
per hour. IR is dependent on the activity of the infected subject. The following values were chosen
from Adams 1993
Next we must calculate the quanta concentration as a function of time using the following equa-
tion:
2Gammaitoni, Nucci 1997
where IVRR (hr−1) represents the infectious virus removal rate in the space investigated. The
infectious virus removal rate (IVRR) is the sum of three parameters (Y ang and Marr, 2011) : the
air change per hour (ACH) via ventilation, the particle deposition on surfaces via gravitational
settling, and the viral inactivation rate (i.e. how long the virus remains contagious in aerosol).
n0 represents the initial number of quanta in the space
I is the number of infectious subjects,
V is the volume of the indoor environment considered,
and ERq is the abovementioned quanta emission rate (quanta h−1)
This model was selected because it has been used in previous papers to estimate infection risk of
other airborne diseases in indoor environments. F or example W agner et al. 2009
The viral inactivation rate of SARS-CoV2 was determined to be .63 by Doremalen et al. 2020 .
Deposition rate is determined by the ratio of the settling velocity of the micrometric particles (1e-4
m/s) and assuming the height of the emmission source. Given the average height of a person is 1.5
m, the deposition_rate is assumed to be .24 per hour (Chatoutsidou and Lazaridis, 2019)
ACH is dependent on room conditions. Is a window open? Is the air conditioning pushing in new
air? In order to determine the ACH we use the flow rate of the V A V inside of the room. V A V flow
rates were determined using V A V spec sheets.
n0 or initial quanta is assumed to be zero in our experiment. This is because there doesn’t seem to
be an accurate way of determining this value. Assuming a natural ventilation ACH of .2, the IVRR
would be 1.02(hr-1) meaning that in a little under an hour any viral particles would be inactive.
So for the sake of this experiment we will assume the room has been empty for about an hour
beforehand.
Finally , to determine the the number of predicted susceptible people infected af-
ter the exposure time, we must find the product of the infection risk R and
the number of susceptible people. T o find R, we use the function below
0.2 Let’s T ry Out Some Estimations
The function get_quanta_emmission_rate accepts a physical activity and an exipratory activity
and a dictionary of assumptions to determine the emission rate of quanta coming from one infected
person.

5W e can see that ventilation can mean the difference between exponential decay of pathogen con-
centration and linear decay of pathogen concentration.
Now lets make risk estimations for a simulated event. Lets assume the event is 1.5 hours long, it will
occur in Center Hall 101 and it will include 50 people who will be walking around, sitting, speaking
and whispering without masks and the airflow set to the ASHRAE recommended standard. W e
can find the risk of airborne infection for this event by finding the average of two events with these
parameters.

0.3 Model: Results and Discussion
The purpose of this calculator is to give building users a better understanding of how infection
can be spread. Our findings give insight into effective methods for mitigating infection risk in
indoor environments. A significant driver in infection risk is the type of physical activity . Heavier
breathing increases risk of infection exponentially . Likewise more intense expiratory activity like
speaking loudly or singing would increase risk of infection. A large factor in risk mitigation is
ventilation. No ventilation at all, we observed, causes a linear decrease in quanta concentration,
while minimal ventilation will produce an exponential decrease in concentration.
The effect of social distancing and mask wearing was not directly addressed by this model. Social
distancing was indirectly addressed by the assumed 1.5m (>6ft) distance from the emission source
in calculating deposition rate. The effect of masks on this model will require further research.
9This model could be further improved by more accurately depicting the cyclical nature of building
airflow. Currently our model assumes that room airflow systems have a constant source of airflow,
but in reality building airflow systems tend to expell long bursts of fresh air and then stop for a
period of time.
0.4 Building Data
In order for the risk estimator tool to be useful and easy to use for the average UC San Diego
user, they should be able to select a building and room and have the room area, volume, and
airflow ranges automatically inputted into their estimation. T o make this possible, room data was
downloaded from the campus database. Because currently the range of variable airflow volume
(V A V) is currently not available for all rooms, and would require a lengthy manual process for
finding and validating V A V setpoint range, each room was assigned an ASHRAE standard airflow
based on the room type which is used for calculating quanta concentration over time.
0.5 W ebsite
Y ou can view our website here: https://hinanawits.github.io/DSC-180B-Presentation-W ebsite/
On this website users will select the building, room, V A V level, any additional air cleaning meth-
ods like air purifiers, the duration of the event, number of occupants, the anticipated activity of
the occupants and masks/no masks. Then the website will display the estimated risk as a bar
charts, which allows the user to visualize the relative differences in risk associated with different
event/airflow parameters. There is also an option to add custom rooms, where a user can upload
their own .csv’s to add rooms to the dataset. Users also have the ability to alter the assumptions
in the calculator in order to have more up-to-date values as more literature is published regarding
COVID-19. Methods are included in our website so those interested can follow step-by-step how
the estimator reaches its conclusions.
The final result is an open-source easy-to-use website that appeals to everyday users who want
peace of mind when entering a room, or need a reference when planning events; and more advanced
users like building operators or developers who want more control over the model.
0.6 F uture W ork
With more information regarding real V A V ranges for buildings on campus being released, the
estimations will become more accurate. F urther integration with building operating systems would
allow more accurate risk estimations. As building occupancy detection methods improve, this
model could be used to update V A V setpoints in real time in order to mitigate airborne infections.

10","The global pandemic of COVID-19 has highlighted the vulnerability of indoor environments to airborne pathogens. In order to reduce the risk of airborne infection, it is important to understand the risk based on building features and occupant activity. One method that has been developed is the infection risk calculator, which allows users to input variables such as number of occupants, room dimensions, and air change per hour (ACH) to determine the risk of transmission. However, these calculators are often ""black box"" algorithms with limited transparency. In this report, the authors describe their own airborne infection risk estimator for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. They explain the calculations involved in determining the emission rate of quanta (viral load), as well as factors such as viral inactivation rate and air change per hour. The report also discusses the impact of ventilation on pathogen concentration and presents estimations for different activities and scenarios. The authors emphasize the importance of ventilation and highlight areas for future improvement, such as incorporating real-time occupancy detection and integrating with building operating systems."

Abstract
This thesis describes a study of machine learning
and its application to mouse wait time in computers.
Speciﬁcally, we are building a classiﬁcation model of
mouse wait time based on dynamic and static system
information within the 2020 time interval to classify if
a mouse wait event would last within 0-5 secs, 5-10
secs, or 10+ secs. Dynamic system information, such
as CPU utilization, is subject to the conﬁguration of
each system. Therefore, by incorporating static system
information which includes the computer conﬁguration
of each system into the model, we could signiﬁcantly
improve the accuracy of the prediction. Currently, the
model reaches an accuracy of 70% with the Decision
Tree Classiﬁer.
1. Introduction
Mouse wait is ofﬁcially called Windows wait cursor,
also known as a busy cursor, which is a mouse icon
status that indicates that mouse cursor is busy or
processes are busy performing operations and set the
cursor to the busy state [1]. When the mouse icon
changes to Windows wait cursor status, the spinning
wheel incident happens and causes users to wait for
the current mouse wait to ﬁnish before interacting with
applications. The problem is that most mouse wait
events are unexpected and users are not willing to wait
if it lasts longer than 1-2 seconds. If we are able to
predict the mouse wait time, users could terminate their
processes ahead of time when they know it might be
a long-term wait. Currently, most studies online are
about ﬁxed or prevent mouse wait events, but there is no
research conducted on the mouse wait time prediction,
which tells users the expected mouse wait times.
In our study, we will build a classiﬁcation model
to predict mouse wait by separating the wait time into
three groups: 0-5 sec, 5-10 sec, and 10+ sec. The
reason we classify the time in this way is that we
regard 0-5 sec as short wait time, 5-10 sec as mediumwait time, and 10+ sec as long wait. Features of our
model include dynamic system information and static
system information, which will be introduced in the
following sections. So far, as for the model, Decision
Tree Classiﬁer has the highest accuracy with fair model
evaluation.
2. Data Collection
Intel® System Usage Report (SUR) collector
XLSDK is a framework that is used to collect
data for this project. In the data collection
process, we implement input libraries (IL) that collect
comprehensive raw data from a computer and then
implement Analyzer Task Libraries (ATL) to clean and
process these raw data.
In the beginning, Intel® Energy Checker SDK
Energy Server (ESRV) executes IL ﬁles to collect
samples every second. After ESRV ﬁnishes collecting
data, it writes raw data into a Database (DB) ﬁle. Next,
when the ATL ﬁle is executed, it reads the DB ﬁle and
processes raw data collected from the ILs, and outputs
data into log ﬁles corresponding to each GUID (Global
Unique Identiﬁer for each computer). In the end, log
ﬁles are uploaded to an online server for further analysis.
User wait input library is a Dynamic Link Library
(DLL) ﬁle. During the collection process, ESRV
executes this ﬁle’s function every 0.1 seconds and also
at any moment when the user clicks any mouse button.
At each iteration, User wait IL uses Windows API
GetCursorInfo and GetIconInfo to capture and analyze
the mouse icon. GetCursorInfo returns the position of
the cursor and a handler to the cursor. By inputting
this handler to GetIconInfo, it will return the icon status
of the cursor. When it returns a Windows wait cursor,
ESRV records the current time and mouse wait event.
After ESRV ﬁnishes its collecting process, it outputs raw
mouse wait data to the DB ﬁle with the variable name
and variable type deﬁned in User wait IL. Since samples
are collecting at every 0.1 seconds. Any event less than
0.1 seconds can’t be detected. However, these eventsare transient, and humans can’t even perceive them, so
missing these events will be of no signiﬁcance.
After recording the mouse wait event, we also
need to know the dynamic system information when
events are happening. It will be best if we can
collect system usage of the process that is responsible.
However, it is hard to track which application causes
the mouse wait event since OS can cause a mouse to
wait at any time. Therefore, we decide to collect all
processes’ system usage when the mouse wait event
happens. Besides User wait IL, we have Process IL.
ESRV executes the Process IL to record comprehensive
information of each process. At each iteration, It
calls the Windows API ZwQuerySystemInformation
and OpenProcess. ZwQuerySystemInformation will
list all processes and their PID (process ID) currently
running on the system and OpenProcess utilizes PID to
collect each process’s system usage like process name,
running time, I/O usage, memory usage, disk usage, and
page fault. Unlike User wait IL which records data only
when it encounters spinning wheel incident event, the
Process IL records and writes all data it captures every
second.
After the raw data is collected and saved as a raw
DB ﬁle, analyzer tasks read the ﬁle and analyze them by
language C and SQL. Since all measurements by ILs are
timestamped, the start time (ts) of a mouse wait event is
the timestamp of the ﬁrst row of that mouse wait event.
The duration (wait msec) of the mouse wait event is the
timestamp difference between the ﬁrst row and last row
of that mouse wait event. By using the ts of a mouse
wait event, ATL can locate the processes in plist data set
that has the same ts, which are running processes during
mouse wait event, and compute CPU-util, Disk-Util,
Network-util, and Hard Page Fault. These features will
be saved as mouse wait all log ﬁle. In the ﬁle, each row
denotes a mouse wait event and each column denotes
system usage related to one mouse wait event.

Table 1. Data set
In the beginning, we implement our own XLSDK
and ATLASK and do the data collection on local
computers, but then we realize the scale of data sets
is too small and may cause the model to have a high
bias. We need more data from all kinds of users. Since
we don’t have the resource to access such many users,
Intel team collect and provide us with data sets. Data
sets includes 14,534,433 rows with 29,587 unique GUIDwithin the 2020 interval. Since the complete dataset
is fairly large, we choose all rows within the 2020
October interval as a train set and choose all rows within
the next month, 2020 November, as a test set for our
model. In the train set, there are 1,729,282 rows and
16,778 distinct GUID. In the test set, there are 1,488,682
rows and 15,702 distinct Guid. For the target feature
wait msecs, we divide the wait time into 0-5s, 5-10s, and
10+s as a preparation for the classiﬁcation model. After
exploring the correlation between potential features and
the mouse wait time, we ﬁnd that dynamic features,
including CPU utilization, disk utilization, hard page
faults, and static features, including the number of cores,
RAM, model type, etc, could inﬂuence the mouse wait
time. These features are then incorporated into the
model.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
In general, mouse wait is caused by a cursor that
indicates that an application is busy performing an
operation [1]. This means system usage is overused.
Before the prediction task, we want to ﬁrst explore
what factors induce mouse wait. We will do some
exploratory data analysis on both dynamic system info
and static-dynamic info.
3.1. Dynamic System Info
The data set we use is ”mousewait all.csv001”,
which is provided by the Intel teams. This data
set records system usage information before and after
mouse wait happens. Each feature in this data set
consists of preﬁx, inﬁx, and sufﬁx. The preﬁx has
”before” and ”after”. It represents is this feature
recorded before or after the mouse wait event. Inﬁx has
”CPU Util”, ”harddpf”, ”disk util” and ”network util”.
This represents what kind of system usage. Sufﬁx has
”min”, ”max” and ”mean”. This represents the way this
feature computes statistics.
Before CpuUtil Max
Before HardDPF Max
Before DiskUtil Max
Before NetworkUtil Max
Table 2. 4 Dynamic System Info Features We Chose
We chose 4 Before ***Max features. The reason
we choose ”Before” is that our model is a predictive
model, which needs to ﬁnish prediction before the
predictive target happens, so it is impossible to get
”after” data. The reason we chose ”Max” is that mouse
wait is caused by system usage overused, ”Max” best
ﬁts this situation.Figure 1. Outlier Exists
The ﬁrst step of the exploratory data analysis is
data cleaning. There is no Null value in the dataset.
However, the column ”wait msecs” contains a lot of
outliers and its distribution is not normally distributed.
As seen in Figure 1, we see there are several points
overwhelmingly larger than others that are accumulated
at less than 3000 sec. However, we decide not to remove
these outliers because the long wait is crucial in our
study. Considering ”before cpuutil max” (maximum
CPU utilization before the mouse wait state) is collected
in percentage, we remove rows that are larger than 100.
After data cleaning, we work on data transformation.
Features like ”before harddpf max” (maximum hard
page faults before the mouse wait state) have a large
variance. It has exponential growth and makes its
data pattern of the ﬁrst half not distinguishable. To
solve this problem, we execute a log transformation
on ”before harddpf max”, ”before cpuutil max”,
”before diskutil max”, ”and before networkutil max”.
Data New= log2Data Old
To ﬁnd potential features for the mouse wait
time, we draw scatter plots in Figure 2 to see
if the log-transformed ”before harddpf max”,
”before cpuutil max”, ”before diskutil max”, and
”before networkutil max” have any relationship with
wait secs. CPU utilization before the mouse wait state
seems to have a slight linear correlation with mouse
wait time. As ”before cpuutil max” gets larger, the wait
time gets larger. In the second graph ”wait msec VS
hard page fault” and the third graph ”wait msec VS disk
utilization”, we can see it exists lines that separate long
time mouse wait and short time mouse wait. Long-time
mouse waits for events cluster at hard page fault’s
interval 5 - 12 and disk utilization’s interval 10 - 20.
These separable lines can be used in the decision tree to
classify short-time mouse wait events and long mouse
wait events, so we should include these features in our
model. Although it seems that there is also separable
long time mouse wait and short time mouse wait in the
fourth graph ”wait msec VS network utilization”, when
we check the distribution of network utilization, 99.89%
Figure 2. Scatterplot for CPU util, disk util, and
harddpf
of network utilization are 0, which means this feature
almost has just one value and so wouldn’t be helpful
for building model. Based These scatter plots, we
choose ”before harddpf max”, ”before cpuutil max”,
”before diskutil max” as our dynamic system info input
features.
We then create a new column for the classiﬁcationFigure 3. Wait secs distribution
task, 0 - 5 sec, 5 - 10 sec, and 10+ sec based on
mouse wait time. The distribution is plotted in Figure
3. Generally, people regard waiting for the mouse as
less than 5 seconds as normal, 5 - 10 seconds as a little
long, and over 10 seconds as a long wait. Figure 3 is the
distribution of the wait time in October 2020. 77% of
the mouse wait events happened in less than 5 seconds.
That would cause a large bias on the ﬁrst classiﬁcation
group, which is a problem that we would solve later.
Figure 4. Wait msecs VS Dynamic System Info
Features
To see how ”before harddpf max”,
”before cpuutil max”, ”before diskutil max”, and
”before networkutil max” might affect mouse wait
time, we draw a plot in 3 dimensions in Figure 4 to
explore further. Each axis represents one dynamic
system info feature. The color of the point represents
its classiﬁcation group. Black points represent 0 - 5 sec,
red points 5 - 10 sec, and yellow points 10+ sec. Also,
the 3D plot is created from 12 GUIDs to make the shape
more obvious. In observation of the plot, ﬁrst of all, the
data in the three groups tend to be on a similar area,
but the red points cluster when ”before harddpf max”
is at 6 - 10, ”before diskutil max” at 10 - 12.5, and
”before cpuutil max” at 3 - 5 (these features are
log-transformed). We can barely see yellow points
on the plot because there is relatively few mouse waitevent over 10+ sec. After rotating the 3D map, we can
see from a certain perspective, classiﬁcation groups
are separated, which means there might be separable
hyperplanes in certain projections. This reminds
us machine learning models that utilize separable
hyperplanes, like decision trees or SVM, will be a good
base model for predicting mouse wait.
3.2. Static System Info
The data set we use is ”system sysinfo unique
normalized.csv000”, which is provided by the Intel
teams. It contains 32 different features and 100,000
unique systems. This data set provides information
about the system hardware like CPU model, GPU,
ram, etc. We choose 9 features from the provided
information, as shown below, as they rigorously
represent the conﬁguration of each system. Among the
9 features, ”chassistype”, ”os”, ”graphicscardclass”,
”cpucode” and ”persona” are nominal features,
and ”ram”, ”age category”, ”processornumber” are
quantitative features as they are ordinal.
chassistype
ram
os
ofcores
agecategory
graphicscardclass
processornumber
cpucode
persona
Table 3. 9 Static System Info Features We Chose
Then, we use the Chi-squared test to test if each
of the nominal features is correlated with the mouse
wait time. The Null hypothesis is that the observed
frequencies of each categorical variable match the
expected frequencies. The Chi-squared test is conducted
with bootstrapping. We sample 5000 mouse wait events
from the training set and compute the p-value for each
categorical feature. We then repeat the process 1000
times. With 1000 p-values in hand, we calculate their
mean and median for each feature. In Figure 5, it
turns out that only the statistics of CPU code, os, and
persona are less than the signiﬁcance level 0.05, the
null hypothesis is rejected, meaning that the features
are not independent. That gives us an idea that the two
categorical features do have a relationship with mouse
wait time.
The features are incorporated into the model later
as an improvement. However, ’cpucode’, ’os’, and
’persona’ are nominal and can’t directly input into theFigure 5. Chi-squared test on each categorical
feature
model. For these nominal features, we execute one hot
transformation. One hot transformation creates a list of
a list of length N, the number of distinct values for each
column. If this column has the Kth distinct value, the
Kth value in the list will be 1, and the value in other
positions is 0.
After One Hot transformation, the 3 nominal
features are transformed into 907 quantitative features
in a matrix. However, the size of the 907 features is too
large to do calculations and most of the values inside
the matrix are zeroes as a sparse matrix. Therefore,
we executed a PCA(Principle Component Analysis)
transformation with n = 30. This PCA will pick the 30
most meaningful dimensions and project other columns
on these 30 dimensions. These 30 columns will be our
static system info input features.
4. Classiﬁcation Model
Target feature: wait msecs.
Target feature classiﬁcation groups: [0-5 sec, 5-10
sec, 10+ sec].
4.1. Baseline
Before building the baseline model, we conduct
some feature engineering. Since there are initially
some zeroes in the features ”before harddpf max”,
”before cpuutil max”, ”before diskutil max”, after they
are log-transformed, the zeroes become negative
inﬁnities. We decide to replace the negative inﬁnities
with zeroes. It could cause little bias to the model
because such values only occupy around 2% of the
whole dataset.
We build the baseline model based only on the
dynamics system information using the Decision Tree
Classiﬁer with default parameters. We select data that
in October 2020, where it has 2,034,448 mouse waitevents with 18,058 unique GUIDs, and hope to predict
the mouse wait in November 2020. Thus, we use data in
October 2020 as the training set and data in November
2020 as the test set. The test set includes 2,034,448
mouse wait events and 18,058 unique GUIDs. Below
is the result of the model in both the training and test
set.
Figure 6. Accuracy of Baseline Model on Training
Set
Figure 7. Accuracy of Baseline Model on Test Set
From the result, ﬁrst of all, the model is overﬁtted,
as the accuracy of the training set is exceptionally high,
while that of the test set is relatively low. The problem
could be mitigated by adjusting the depth of the decision
tree. Also, the precision and recall are higher for the
group 0-5s but lower for the rest of the two groups.
That means the model performs better on the ﬁrst group.
The reason could be that there are much more mouse
wait events that last 0 - 5 seconds. This problem could
be improved by adding in more features, such as static
features that take system conﬁguration into account.
4.2. Improved Model
To further improve the model, we include features
from static system information. We perform One Hot
Encoding for the categorical features, append to the
quantitative features and convert the data frame into a
matrix. Lastly, combing the matrix with the one from
the dynamic features, we use Decision Tree Classiﬁer
to perform the modeling again on the same training and
test set.
The performance of the new model is better than
the baseline model, but it still has the problem that
the F-1 score on group 5-10 second and group 10+
second is pretty low. Then, we improve the model by
tuning the model’s hyperparameters ”Max Depth” and
”Max Leaf Nodes”.Figure 8. Accuracy of Model Combined Static
System Info
By testing on max depth from 5 to 100, we ﬁnd that
as the maximum depth of the tree gets larger, the F-1
score of group 0-5 second gets lower, F-1 score of group
5-10 second, and group 10+ second gets higher. We
can choose a max depth like 50 if we want to focus on
group 5-10 second and group 10+ second. By testing
max leafnode from 2 to 5200, we ﬁnd as the maximum
leave node of the tree gets larger, the F-1 score of group
0-5 second keeps the same F-1 score of group 5-10
second and group 10+ second gets higher. All 3 groups’
F-1 scores keep relatively constant after the max leave
node is after 4000. We can choose a max-leaf node like
4500 to achieve a high F-1 score.
Figure 9. F1-score VS dierent Max Depth
4.3. Bagging
Even by adding more features or changing different
max depth, the F-1 score on group 5-10 second or group
10+ second still can’t exceed 0.2. We think this is
because these two groups have too few samples that
each of their proportions is about 10% of the whole data
set. One possible way to solve the problem of unbalance
distribution is to use bagging.
Bagging, also called bootstrap aggregating, is a
machine learning algorithm designed to improve the
stability of the machine learning model. Bagging starts
Figure 10. F1-score VS dierent Max LeafNode
by bootstrap samples from the training set and learns
them in parallel. Doing so will generate multiple
models, and we will pick the prediction that is the most
frequent among the model outputs.
In ﬁgure 3, we see group 0-5 second is around 7
times big as group 5-10 second or group 10+ second.
So we divide the 0-5 second group into 7 sub-group and
combine each sub-group with two small groups. Then
we have 7 new data sets. Each new data set has the same
sample amount, which ensures that the classiﬁcation
groups in the new data set have close proportion. Then,
We train 7 decision tree models with each new data
set. After classiﬁcation, the 7 models will give us 7
predictions and we use majority rules to decide the ﬁnal
prediction.
Figure 11. F1-score After Bagging
Bagging brings us a big improvement two on group
5-10 second and group 10+ second although the F-1
score on the group 0-5 second decreases. The point is
that we want to pay more attention to these two groups
with fewer amount of mouse wait events. To improve
performance on all groups, we need to explore more
related features.
5. Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we have explored how machine
learning can be used for classifying the mouse waittime. The mouse wait is separated into three groups
for classiﬁcation: 0-5 seconds, 5-10 seconds, and 10+
seconds. We started by collecting data using Intel’s
software development kits, and by training a Decision
Tree Model on dynamic features, we achieved an
accuracy of 61.2%. The model was improved to 73.9%
by adding in static features which include information
of system conﬁguration. Unfortunately, due to highly
unbalanced wait time as there is over 80% of data at
less than 5 seconds, the second (5-10 seconds) and third
groups (10+ seconds) were less accurate than the ﬁrst
group (0-5 seconds). This problem was mitigated by
using parameter tuning and bagging algorithm, which
overall increased the F1 score 2 times higher. The work
is presented on a Github web page.
As future work, ﬁrstly, since there were few common
GUIDs as we merged different data sets, we aim to
collect data that involves the same GUIDs. Also, we
will keep improving accuracy on the median and long
mouse wait group by ﬁnding more relevant features.

1. Abstract
Our goal for this project is to understand and discover
features that affect the battery’s estimated remaining time.
Through our exploratory data analysis, we have discovered
eight features, namely the number of devices, number of
processes, average memory, average page faults, designed
capacity, cpu percentage, cpu seconds, and cpu tempera-
ture. Using these eight features, we decided to come up
with several different models, Linear Regression, Decision
Tree Regressor, SVM, Random Forest Regressor, Adaboost
Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor and Bagging Re-
gressor. To understand which model performs the best given
these features, we performed hypothesis testing. In the end,
our results show that Gradient Boosting Regressor performs
the best out of all in that the maes generated on the train
and test set are quite low and very similar. This indicates
that Gradient Boosting Regressor has less of an overﬁtting
issue than the other two models. Another indication is that
through our hypothesis testing, our P-values indicate that
Gradient Boosting Regressor performs the best among all
others.
2. Introduction
Ever since the advent of personal computers and mobile
devices, the attention has shifted to battery technology.
Reasons for such are many, but one main factor is attributed
to people’s rise of expectation in the speed and longevity
of these devices. In the early days, the slow and glitchy
devices used to be the norm. In fact, having one was a
luxury in and out of itself. However, as tech companies
competed against each other to release the better product,
these devices began to see a dramatic increase in their
speed and longevity. This in turn led to groups of scientists
and engineers coming together to investigate and delve
deeper into the problem of lagging, and the solution they
believed would exponentially increase people’s device
usage was to invest in battery technology. In an attempt
to maintain the churn rate, groups of professionals ﬂocked
to battery experts to apply the latest technology onto their
devices such that customer satisfaction would remain high.
For such reasons, we would like to investigate the featuresthat affect the battery’s estimated remaining time.
Provided by the Intel Teams, we have decided to
speciﬁcally focus on battery related datasets. Namely, some
of these datasets would contain the needed GUIDs, or
systems that we are interested in; the speciﬁed devices,
which in our case, would be DC battery; cpu information,
which provide insight to issues of overheating and cpu
capabilities; process information, which allows us to
understand the memory usage and page faults of these
running processes. In the following sections, we will delve
deeper into many of these features and eventually build a
model based on the features we deem appropriate for our
analysis.
3. Methods
3.1. Data Collection
This part emphasized on the accomplishments we have
done for the last quarter: We practiced the Data Collection
process – Our interested data ﬁelds for collecting are those
we believed that would be related to the lifetime of batteries.
To retrieve data, we ﬁrst replicated what was instructed
on the main documentation [Int] from MSDN:
Enumerate the battery devices through
SetupDiGetClassDevs functiongetting
the name and details of this battery through
SetupDiGetDeviceInterfaceDetail and
SetupDiEnumDevice Interfaces, and creating a
handle to request information from it;
To retrieve information, we ﬁrst need to
request for Battery_Tag through using
IOCTL_BATTERY_QUERY_TAG control
code, and with this tag, we are able to
retrieve Battery_Designed_Capacity ,
Battery_Full_Charged_Capacity ,
and Battery_Cycle_Count through
IOCTL_BATTERY_QUERY_INFORMATIONcontrol code.
To retrieve Battery_Current_Capacity ,
Battery_Voltage ,Battery_Rate , we used
control code IOCTL_BATTERY_QUERY_STATUS .
For other data we need, we also re-
fer to GetSystemPowerStatus and
CallNtPowerInformation functions. These two
functions retrieve back Battery_Left ,Battery_Flag
,Battery_Life_Time ,Battery_Charging ,
Battery_Discharging ,Battery_MaxCapacity .
We revised our input library based on the sample
provided on static_standard_input . Therefore, our
input library is dependent on a static input library. The
reason for using a static library is that the number and the
type of our inputs data would not change over time.
With the self-designed input library, we run ersv.exe
for about 2 hours with a time interval of 30 seconds to
collect around 3000 records of data.
These practices on collecting data by building on our
own input libraries gave us a better sense on how the drivers
control the sensors on our computers for collecting multiple
information.
3.2. Data Preparation
For the second quarter, unlike what we have done for
the previous one, we were provided with the pre-collected
data by the Teams. Therefore, all of our analysis are based
on those datasets.
Our interested datasets are Battery Events related
dataset (batt acdc events.csv000.gz), Battery Information
related Dataset (batt info.csv000.gz), Device usage
related Dataset (devuse 4known device.csv000.gz
and devuse 4known device.csv001.gz), CPU
related Dataset (hw metric histo.csv000.gz and
hwmetric histo.csv001.gz), and Process related Dataset
(plist process resource util13wks.csv000.gz).
Battery Events dataset would provide us with activities
log for batteries, for example, it contains the information
about whether the battery is running on Direct Current or
Alternating Current; Battery Information dataset gave us
a comprehension about the static information of batteries,
for example, the full charged capacity for each battery;
Device Dataset would enable us to understand what kind
of device our system is currently running on; CPU related
Dataset contains the information about CPU information,
for example, current CPU temperature and CPU utilization.
Steps for collecting interested information are listed
below:We started with Device Usage related Dataset with
ﬁltering conditions of i) device name must be
‘GUID DEVICE BATTERY’; and ii). The collected
time should be within September of 2020. After
loading Device Usage related Dataset, we obtained
our interested GUIDs.
In order to ﬁlter out only DC battery, we switched
focus on Battery Events related Datasets. To ﬁlter
out Battery Events dataset, we added the ﬁltering
conditions that the battery type should be ‘DC’ and
the collected time should also be within September
of 2020. After this, we get a new set of our needed
GUIDs, and we explored other datasets based on
those needed GUIDs.
We utilized those GUIDs for further ﬁltering on
other datasets (e.g. Battery Information related
Dataset, Process related Dataset and CPU related
Dataset). For CPU related Datasets, one additional
ﬁltering condition we added is that the data must
contain information about CPU utilization per each
CPU core or information about CPU temperature in
centigrade.
After collecting needed data, we manually selected 8
features for predicting Battery minutes remaining. From
Battery Information related dataset, we selected Average
Full Charge Capacity; From Process related dataset, we
selected number of processes per guid, Average Page Faults
per guid, Average Memory per guid, and Average CPU
seconds per guid; From CPU related dataset, we selected
Average CPU utilization per each CPU core and Average
CPU temperature per guid; From Device Usage related
dataset, we selected number of devices per guid.
3.3. EDA
We chose 8 features as our features on building our
regression model for predicting battery remaining minutes.
The reasons for selecting those 8 features are that 1).
From our experiences, we realized that when we have
multiple process or devices are going on, usually the
battery would have a lower remaining time; 2). When
memory related issue occurs, it would always affect the
performance of batteries. Therefore, we considered Page
Faults and Memory as another features to select; 3).
Static information of battery, for example, the full charged
capacity or designed capacity would deﬁnitely deﬁne the
attribute of battery, making the performance of battery
different; 4). CPU related information would also be a
factor the inﬂuence the battery remaining time.
With our comprehension above, we did a correlation
analysis between those selected 8 features and battery re-
maining minutes and the results are:Correlation Analysis indicates that there are weakly-
negative correlation between battery minutes remaining
and number of devices per guid, number of processes per
guid, Average Page Faults per guid, Average CPU seconds
per guid, Average Full Charge Capacity, Average CPU
utilization per each CPU core, Average CPU temperature
per guid. Even though the correlation values are pretty
low, the negativity still conﬁrms with our expectation as
we believed that as the values of those features increase,
battery minutes remaining should decrease. One possible
explanation for the low value of correlation coefﬁcients, as
suggested by the Teams, is that those ﬁelds were mixed
with both the DC and AC batteries, and we were unable to
separate them.
3.4. Model
For the Model Part, we started our model building by
using Linear Regression model, which is the most basic ma-
chine learning model to start, and later came up with some
more complex models and ﬁnally selected 3 models with
the lowest Mean Absolute Error. The reason for choosing
Mean Absolute Error is that we are selecting a Regression
Model, and we wants to see how varied our predictions
are compared to the true values, no matter which directions
those predictions are varied.
3.4.1. Baseline Model: Linear Regression
We started building our prediction model based on Lin-
ear Regression, the simplest regression model. After training
on the model on the training dataset and test on the test
dataset, we obtained a Mean Squared Error of 0.2656 on
test dataset, which is lower than the mae of 0.2666 on the
training set. We are not sure on the performance of this
model, and want to see whether we could decrease mae
further, so we switch to improved models.
3.4.2. Improved Model:
We tried different models and selected 3 models with the
lowest maes as our improved models: Gradient BoostingRegressor, Support Vector Machine and AdaBoosting
Regressor. For the other two models we have tried, we
realized that these two models would overﬁt our data.
For our improved Model, we realized that only Gradient
boosting Regressor, SVM, and Adaboosting Regressor do
not occur the issue of over-ﬁtting, so we are going to pay
more attention on those and did Hypothesis Testing to see
which one is the best improved model.
3.5. Hypothesis Testing
3.5.1. SVM vs Gradient Boosting Regressor:
In our hypothesis testing, we would like to understand
the performance between the SVM and the Gradient
Boosting Regressor on our Dataset.
There’s no difference in performance between SVM
and Gradient Boosting Regressor.
Gradient Boosting Regressor performs better than
SVM.
Our test statistic for our hypothesis test is the observed
difference between the MSE on the test set using SVM and
the MSE on the test set using Gradient Boosting Regressor.
With this, we then ran a simulation to generate new X and y
by test, train, and split X and y in every new iteration, for a
total of 1000 iterations. Our simulated differences in MSEs
between the two models are displayed by the plot below:
Comparing our observed test statistic to our simulated
test statistics, our p-value comes out to be 0.0. As a result,
we reject the null hypothesis given our threshold of 0.05,
but only by very slightly. This tells us that the Gradient
Boosting Regressor does perform slightly better than SVM.3.5.2. AdaBoosting Regressor vs Gradient Boosting Re-
gression:
After comparing the performance between SVM and
Gradient Boosting Regressor, we would like to understand
the performance between AdaBoosting Regressor and
Gradient Boosting Regressor on our Dataset. From above,
we could see that the mae generated by the Gradient
Boosting Regressor performed better in the sense that the
mae on the test is lower than the mae on the test from
AdaBoosting Regressor. Since we would like to verify
if Gradient Boosting Regressor’s performance is due to
random chance or not, our null and alternative hypothesis
are as follow:
Null Hypothesis: There’s no difference in
performance between AdaBoosting Regressor
and Gradient Boosting Regressor
Alternative Hypothesis: Gradient Boosting
Regressor performs better than AdaBoosting
Regressor.
Our test statistic for our hypothesis test is the observed
difference between the MSE on the test set using Gradient
Boosting Regressor and the MSE on the test set using
AdaBoosting Regressor. With this, we then ran a simulation
to generate new X and y by test, train, and split X and y
in every new iteration, for a total of 1000 iterations. Our
simulated differences in MSEs between the two models are
displayed by the plot below:
Comparing our observed test statistic to our simulated
test statistics, our p-value comes out to be 0.015. As
a result, we fail to reject the null hypothesis given our
threshold of 0.05. This indicates that Gradient Boosting
Regressor performs better than AdaBoosting Regressor.
3.6. Discussion and Limitations
After discussing our project with Teams, we realized
that we have mainly three limitations:
Features are not sufﬁcient as we still need to con-
sider the factors from users. For example, users
playing games would always have a lower batteryremaining time comparing to users using only basic
operations;
In evaluating battery remaining time, using average
is not the best way as one situation might be that,
the user initially do not plug in the charger, so the
battery remaining time would be 180 minutes; but
after he or she plugging in the charger, the remaining
time would increase, say, to 240 minutes. Therefore,
we anticipate the remaining minutes should be 240
minutes. But according to our averaging logic, we
would get 210 minutes.
For the feature of number of devices per guid, we ig-
nored the factes that different devices would require
different power of battery to run. Therefore, this
might cause our correlation analysis be confounded;
We noticed that the correlation coefﬁcients are pretty
low. One explanation is that our dataset is limited
as ﬁelds such as CPU related information are mixed
with both DC and AC data, which we were unable
to separate.
3.7. Conclusion
Our goal is to understand the features that affect the
battery’s estimated remaining time. Through our exploratory
data analysis, we have found eight features, namely the
number of devices, number of processes, average memory,
average page faults, designed capacity, cpu percentage, cpu
seconds, and cpu temperature. With these features in hand,
we then built several models. In the end, we discovered
that out of all, Gradient Boosting Regressor performs the
best.

Abstract
 
In this project, our goal is to find the relationship between the Persona and their PC system. We
 
are trying to compare the performances of different models and use the features in the system to
 
predict the type of a user. To achieve this, we collect data from the user end, clean the data,
 
explore the data using hypothesis tests and fit our data into some classification machine learning
 
models, and also test the performance and optimizing parameters of our models.
 
Introduction
 
With the development of hardware products in the PC market, there are more and more choices
 
for people to choose their PC configuration. For different users, they have different needs for
 
their computers. For example, the gamers need more power on the CPU and graphic cards. For
 
other people like pro video editors or engineers, they may need more memory for them to run
 
some professional applications like Final Cut Pro, CAD, etc.. In our project, our goal is to find
 
the relation between the users’ system and the type of the users. Also, we are trying to use the
 
data of the user's system to predict the type of  the user.
 
Background
 
There are mainly 4 steps: data collecting, cleaning, EDA and modeling. For collecting the data,
 
we use the ATLSDK and XLSDK provided by Intel. In the data we collected, there are some
 
missing and suspicious values in the data. After cleaning, we proceed to EDA to explore the
 
data. We also did some hypothesis testing in some of the features. See the description of all
 
features in appendix 1.1.
 
Methods
 
1.Data collection:
 
To get the data from the PC system, we use the XLDSK and ATLSDK provided by Intel and
 
build an input library. We are given the basic template of data collection by Intel. We added
 
some useful metrics and used some APIs to get the data we want. We mainly collected the data
 related to the user’s battery, like capacity, percentage remaining, etc.. Intel also provided us the
 
users’ system data so that we can have more information about the users.
 
ATLSDK:
 
Analyzer Task Libraries (ATLs) are used by the Intel® System Usage Report (SUR) field data
 
collector to expand and customize basic features and collection capabilities. These libraries are
 
the preferred mechanism to supplement the Intel® SUR field data collector with new data
 
collection capabilities, new business logics, or support for new logging formats.
 
Input libraries:
 
Input Libraries – or ILs – are the data collection units of the Intel SUR collector. The nature of
 
an IL is to allow for strong code reuse, thus reducing TTM. Use of existing ILs allows customers
 
to leverage the expertise of other teams. Over time, customers can gradually build up a custom
 
collection of ILs.
 
ILs expose at least one input (or metric). However, ILs can reconfigure themselves at any time to
 
change the number and the nature of their inputs without requiring a stop and restart of the
 
collector. If needed, this allows for the development of complex modules with the ability to
 
adapt to various platform changes.
 
 
2.Data Cleaning and EDA:
 
After we got the data, there were some nan and weird values. We cleaned the data and did some
 
data transformation, like one-hot encodings on categorical features, so that we can do further
 
tests and analysis.
 
 
When cleaning is done, we explore some important features we will use and see their
 
distributions. We investigate some of the main features of the user’s. See in appendix 
​
2.1
​
 to 
​
2.5
​
.
  
3.Paired-T Tests On Numerical Features (RAM):
 
The goal of our hypothesis testing here is to check if there is a significant difference between the
 
RAM of different types of users. The reason we use paired t-test is that two sample t-test is
 
designed for testing differences between independent groups. We consider each persona as an
 
independent group.
 
Null hypothesis: There is no difference in RAM between the two types of personas
 
(users).
 
Alternative hypothesis: There is a difference in RAM between the two types of
 
personas(users).
 
Results: See all results in the appendix
​
 3.1
​
. Because most of the p-values are significant,
 
we extract the insignificant ones here.
  
From the p-values we get from all pairs of personas, we can conclude that most pairs of personas
 
have a significant difference in RAM, which means we reject the null hypothesis and move to
 
the alternative hypothesis. We also did the test for other numerical features and the results further
 
proved our thoughts.
 
 
4.Chi-Square Tests for Independence on Categorical Features:
 
Our goal here is to find if the categorical features are related or independent from the personas
 
(user types). A chi-square test for independence compares two variables in a contingency table to
 
see if they are related. In a more general sense, it tests to see whether distributions of categorical
 
variables differ from each other.
 
 
Null hypothesis: The two categorical variables are independent (no association between
 
the two variables)
 
Alternative hypothesis: The two categorical variables are dependent (there is an
 
association between the two variables)
 
 
The first step is to transform the features in our dataframe into crosstables. Use the 
​
chassistype 
​
as
 
an example here.

After the transformation, we can apply the contingency table, and get the p-values between the
 
persona. Using a threshold of 0.05, we can determine whether the p -value we get is significant
 
or not. See all results in appendix 
​
3.2
​
.
 
5.Machine learning models
 
There are three main points in our experiment setting:
 
●
Start 5 trials for the whole experiment. In each trail, generate random train and test data.
 
●
For each classifier, try different parameters.
 
●
Use both accuracy and F1 score as metric
 
 
We mainly use 6 different machine learning models to predict the persona: K Nearest
 
Neighbours, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network, Stochastic Gradient Descent and
 
Logistic Regression. For each of the models, the first split the data into training and testing sets,
 
and then fit the training data into our model. Also, optimizing parameters and trails We compare
 
the models’ performance using accuracy score and F1 score (

Analysis
 
1.K Nearest Neighbours
 
KNN is a model that classifies data points based on the points that are most similar to it. It uses
 
test data to make an “educated guess” on what an unclassified point should be classified as. In
 
our case, we are trying to predict a user’s type by identifying which cluster the user is in. The
 
following is the graph of performance. The parameter here is: N neighbours.

2.Decision Tree
 
Decision trees are constructed via an algorithmic approach that identifies ways to split a data set
 
based on different conditions. It is one of the most widely used and practical methods for
 
supervised learning. The following is the graph of performance. The parameter here is:
 
max_depth.
 
 
 
 
3.Random Forest
 
Based on decision trees, random forest builds multiple decision trees and merges them together
 
to get a more accurate and stable prediction. 
​
The following is the graph of performance. The
 
parameter here is: max_depth.
 
  
 
4.Neural Network --Multilayer Perceptron
 
 
A perceptron is a simple binary classification algorithm. It helps to divide a set of input signals
 
into two parts—“yes” and “no”. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a perceptron that teams up with
 
additional perceptrons, stacked in several layers, to solve complex problems. The parameter
 
here is: max_iteration.
 
 
5.Stochastic Gradient Descent
 
Gradient, in plain terms, means slope or slant of a surface. So gradient descent literally means
 
descending a slope to reach the lowest point on that surface.The main goal of SGD is to reach
 
the minimum of loss function. The parameter here is: max_iteration.
  
6.Logistic Regression
 
Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning algorithm which is used for classification problems, it
 
is a predictive analysis algorithm and based on the concept of probability.
 
 
Conclusion
 
Based on our feature analysis and hypothesis testing, we conclude that most of our selected
 
features are correlated with persona, except the CPU vendor. This may because the vendors are
 
not a key factor of the user system setting, a vendor can have various kinds of product. In this
 
case, it makes sense that CPU vendor is not a related feature with persona.
 
 From the performance analysis of all six models, we conclude that the Neural Network --
 
Multilayer Perceptron is the best fit for our data. The first reason we consider is the flexibility.
 
They are very flexible and can be used generally to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. This
 
flexibility allows them to be applied to other types of data.

Abstract
During the first half of this project, we
learned about Intel’s telemetry framework. The
framework allows remote data collection from
devices with Windows operating systems. Two
important components of the telemetry framework
are the Input Library (IL) and Analyzer Task Library
(ATL). The IL exposes metrics from a device and the
ATL generates on-device statistics from the data
collected by the IL. In the second half of the project,
we used pre-collected data provided by Intel that
used their telemetry framework to create a
classification model. Our goal with the model was
to
predict the persona of a user using their computer’s
specifications, CPU utilization, CPU temperature,
and time spent on certain types of applications. User
personas were provided by Intel which classified if
users were casual web users, gamers,
communication, etc.. The classifications of these
personas were done by Intel based on the amount of
time users spent on certain applications based on
their usage of different types of .exe files. For
example, if a majority of a device’s time is spent
on
an application like Skype, they are most likely
classified as a communication user. Similarly, if
a
user spends a majority of their time on the League
of
Legends .exe file, they are most likely classified
as a
gamer. After training multiple classification models,
we were able to predict user personas with 64%
accuracy using a gradient boosting classifier. In
the
following paper, we will discuss our hypotheses,
processes, methodologies, and results.

Introduction
We used four datasets to answer this
question which were provided by the Intel
Corporation team – hw_metric_histo.csv,
system_sysinfo_unique_normalized.csv,
frgnd_backgrnd_apps.csv, and
ucsd_apps_exe_class.csv. All four datasets were
pre-collected by Intel using Intel’s System Usage
Report (SUR) collector using their telemetry
framework. hw_metric_histo contains information
about a laptop’s average CPU utilization and
temperature. system_sysinfo_unique_normalized
contains data on a device’s specifications (CPU,
GPU, number of cores, etc.)  and their
predetermined persona provided by Intel (gamer,
casual user, office, entertainment, etc.).
frgnd_backgrnd_apps.csv provides information on
the devices’ time spent on certain applications and
ucsd_apps_exe_class.csv contains information on
the .exe files’ application type classification. By
combining these datasets, we created a dataframe
with the device’s specifications, CPU utilization,
CPU temperature, and application usage to predict
the respective user’s persona. To make our
predictions, we used multiple scikit-learn
classification models. We trained a total of seven
different classification models, but ultimately choseChen, Wong, Zhang
2
to analyze and delve deeper into our radial basis
function SVM, AdaBoost, and gradient boosting
classification models based on their performance and
some interesting shortcomings.
There were a total of eleven personas
provided within the dataset: web user, casual user,
gamer, casual gamer, office/productivity, content
creator/IT, communication, Windows Store
application user, entertainment, file & network
sharer, and unknown. We believe that some personas
such as web users and casual users are very similar
in terms of their device specifications; thus, we
made an assumption that features such as CPU
utilization, CPU temperature, etc. would be similar
as well. Because of this, we decided to reduce the
11
different classifications down to four categories.
Web users, casual users, communication, Windows
Store application users, entertainment, and file &
network sharers were categorized as “casual web
users” (encoded as 0).  Gamers and casual gamers
were labeled as “gamers” (encoded as 1).
Office/productivity and IT/content creators were
condensed into “IT/content creators” (encoded as 2).
Lastly, the unknown category remained as
“unknown” (encoded as 3). These categories were
numerically encoded so that they could be used in
a
machine learning model. With the encoded target
variables and the prepared features from the
aforementioned datasets, we were ready to begin
training our classification models.
2.1
Methodologies - Initial Model Testing
To begin model selection, we ran a for-loop
training and tested multiple scikit-learn classification
models: decision trees, extra trees, random forest,
AdaBoost, three nearest neighbors, radial basis
function SVM, and gradient boosting classifiers. The
data was split with 80% of the data as the training
set and the other 20% as the test set using
scikit-learn’s .train_test_split(). Inside the for
loop,
the models were trained, tested against the test set,
and then scored using scikit-learn’s .score() function.
The top five performing classification models were
decision tree, random forest, radial basis function
SVM, AdaBoost, and gradient boosting
classification with accuracy scores of 67.67%,
66.87%, 66.83%, 65.29% and 64.10%, respectively
(see Figure 1).
Figure 1.
Accuracy scores of user’s persona
prediction from the seven classification models.
Albeit the decision tree model performed the
best, we realized that it was not doing well in
predicting users who were not casual web users.
Because a majority of the user personas in our
dataset are “casual web users”, the model could
classify everyone as a “casual web user” and still
achieve a higher accuracy score due to class
imbalance. The decision tree, random forest,
AdaBoost, and radial basis function SVM all
suffered from this flaw. A confusion matrix of our
decision tree classifier is shown below to depict
the
issue of class imbalance (see Figure 2).
Chen, Wong, Zhang

Figure 2.
Decision tree confusion matrix and
example of class imbalance.
From the figure, we can see that it does a
good job at classifying the casual users with 94.47%
accuracy; however, the model is unable to classify
gamers, IT/office users, and unknowns consistently.
From this initial run of model testing, we knew that
we needed to better handle the class imbalance.
2.2
Methodologies -  Model Selection & Class
Imbalance Mitigation
To fix class imbalance, we added
scikit-learn’s class_weight = ‘balanced’ parameter
to
the decision tree, extra trees, random forest, and
radial basis function SVM. Adding this parameter
had large effects on some models. Accounting for
class imbalance in the decision tree and random
forest models dropped the models’ accuracy from
65% to 40% and 64% to 36%, respectively. The
accuracy of extra trees and radial basis function
SVM did not change much from adding the
class_weight = ‘balanced’ parameter. Initially, the
accuracy of the extra trees and radial basis function
SVM were 65% and 64%, respectively; however,
after accounting for class imbalance the accuracies
were 67% and 65%, respectively. The updated
accuracy scores are shown below (see Figure 3).
Figure 3.
Accuracy scores from the seven
classification models after adding class_imblance
=
‘balanced’ to decision tree, extra trees, random
forest, and radial basis function SVM classifiers.
After adding the class_imbalance parameter,
our top three models were the AdaBoost, radial basis
function SVM, gradient boosting classifiers.
3.1
Results - AdaBoost Classifier
The AdaBoost classifier received an overall
accuracy of 66%. The classifier predicted casual web
users, gamers, office and productivity users, and
unknowns with  91%, 24%, 0%, and 78% accuracy,
respectively. The AdaBoost classifier still has a
flaw
with class imbalance as its stronger performance was
based on its strong bias towards classifying most
users as a casual web user. The confusion matrix is
provided for a more in-depth visualization of its
performance (see Figure 4).

3.2
Results - Radial Basis Function SVM
Classifier
The SVM classifier received an overall
accuracy of 64%. The classifier predicted casual web
users, gamers, office and productivity users, and
unknowns with  99%, 0%, 0%, and 0% accuracy,
respectively. Even though the class_imbalance
parameter was set to ‘balanced’, the model had a
very strong bias towards casual web users. The
confusion matrix is provided for a more in-depth
visualization of its performance (see Figure 5).
Figure 5.

3.3
Results - Gradient Boosting Classifier
The gradient boosting classifier received an
overall accuracy of 63%. The classifier predicted
casual web users, gamers, office and productivity
users, and unknowns with  87%, 26%, 3%, and 78%
accuracy, respectively. The gradient boosting
classifier did the best overall. The model lost some
accuracy with the predicting causal web users, but
gained some accuracy compared to the other models
for predicting gamers, office and productivity users,
and unknowns. The confusion matrix is provided for
a more in-depth visualization of its performance (see
Figure 6).
Figure 6.
Gradient boosting classifier confusion
matrix.
Because our gradient boosting classifier had
the best overall performance, we decided to examine
the most important features for the model. Using
scikit-learn’s feature_importances_ function, we
looked at the model’s five most important features.
NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1050 graphics cards,
average CPU utilization, average CPU temperature,
Iris 540 graphics cards, and AMD Radeon R7 450
graphics were our most important features (see
Figure 7).

Discussion
Our goal was to create a classification model
to predict a user’s persona based on their device
specifications, CPU utilization, CPU temperature,
and their time spent on different types of
applications. We trained a total of seven models
through the scikit-learn package: decision trees,
extra trees, random forest, AdaBoost, three nearest
neighbors, radial basis function SVM, and gradient
boosting classifiers. After training and testing all
of
the models during our initial run, we realized that
our gradient boosting classification model performed
the best as it was able to predict casual web users
and unknown users with 87% and 78% accuracy,
respectively. It predicted gamers and office and
productivity users with 26% and 3% accuracy,
respectively. Though the accuracy of these two
categories were not particularly the greatest, they
did
a much better job of predicting these categories in
comparison to our AdaBoost and radial basis
function SVM models. We found that our best model
was the gradient boosting classifier which predicts
a
user’s persona with 64% accuracy.
Taking a deeper look into our gradient
boosting classifier and its features, we saw that
the
presence of NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1050 graphics
cards, Iris 540 graphics cards, AMD Radeon R7 450
graphics cards as well as average CPU utilization
and average CPU temperature were our most
important features in predicting a user’s persona.

Introduction
Several models exist for the transmission of SARS-CoV -2
(severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2) based on varying assumptions and parameters.
The Chu
and Chen
models
investigate coronavirus transmission and infection
as functions of nonpharmaceutical
interventions (physical distances, masks) and respiratory
droplets, respectively . The results of the
Chu model suggest guidelines for social distancing
(1 meter or more) between individuals and
public usage of facial and eye protection, while the
Chen model shows the relationship between
droplet size and transmission range. The two models
both attempt to examine coronavirus
transmission, but they report results that are not
necessarily conflicting, but rather , incomplete on
their own. The significance of this problem is that
because models vary depending on the
parameters and underlying assumptions, there is uncertainty
on how to filter out the valid and
optimal inputs. In this replication study , we develop
a simple infection rate model based on the
results and parameters reported by the Chu and Chen
models, the MIT  COVID-19 Indoor Safety
Tool, and the airborne.cam tool by Cambridge.
The output of this experiment will be primarily a
simulation where a user will be able to set
parameters to see the resulting risks and infections
caused by in person instructions. This report
will be a secondary output along with the website
and visual presentation and will be used as a
guide to explain methods as well as theory behind
the work.
Definitions and existing models
●
‘Chu’  model: Meta analysis of many COVID papers, resulting
in part in a model that
approximately halves transmission rates for every
meter traveled by the airborne particles
(rate ~= 1/2.02 per meter).
[1]
●
‘Chen’  model: Fluid Dynamics Simulation to determine
prevalence of short-range aerial
and droplet transmission. This model shows that at
very close ranges (<.3 meters, i.e. ~1
foot), there is an infection rate much higher than
other linear models. This indicates that
multiple models are needed to be considered to create
our final schema and model.
[2]
●
MIT COVID-19 Indoor Safety Tool: A set of safety protocols
determined by
mathematical models accounting for physical distances,
number of people in a given
room, ventilation, and mask-wearing.
●
Cambridge model: A risk calculator for determining
infection based on room features,
occupancy , ventilation, and viral loads (as input
parameters).
●
Six-Foot Rule: A guideline that states that an individual
may safely interact socially with
another person with minimal risk of contracting covid-19
virus when wearing the
necessary equipment.Assumptions
●
Agents wearing a mask will continue to do so
●
All school-mandated guidelines (windows, masks, etc)
are enforced without incident
●
Transmission is limited to current knowledge of COVID-19,
however newer strains may
have a higher base infection rate (see Wave 4)
●
Individual ef fects of COVID and Vaccination rates
are not considered
●
2 initial students are infected
●
All students ‘infected’  are considered to have received
an eventually infective dose
Constraints
●
Infectiousness of viral particles is an ongoing field
of study . The thorough methodology
of the ‘Chen’  study , providing model parameters such
as ‘Inhalation fraction’  (used for
mask usage), ‘Thermal conductivity of air [W atts *
meter^-1 * Kelvin^-1]’, and
‘[exhaled] air jet initial momentum [meters^4 * seconds^-2]
●
As viral load deposition at a distance is not the
primary function of this model (and as our
model has to be run in time steps), the computation
necessary for adding the first model’ s
parameters to ours is prohibitive, leading us to use
their conclusions and cite their
workings as a source instead.
Well-mixed Room
The definition of a room that is well mixed is that
the pathogen is distributed uniformly
throughout the room (Bazant)
[3]
. Furthermore according
to Bazant, one is no safer from airborne
pathogens at 60 feet than 6 feet. This renders the
Six-Foot Rule somewhat inef fective to reduce
the spread of the Covid-19 Viruses.
Bazant’ s theory can be further supported with data
presented in
Sture Holmber g and Qingyan
Chen’ s simulations of  dif ferent ventilation systems
in the classroom.
[6]
In the result of their
simulation, a classroom with mix ventilation system
implemented will have a roughly uniform
distribution of aerosol particles across the room.
Since most mechanical ventilation systems in
real life like air conditioners are designed to realize
mix ventilation, it is reasonable to assume
that school classrooms will be under such mix ventilation
conditions. Therefore, the well-mixed
room theory is well supported and it is safe to implement
the MIT  model in our one room
modeling.
Within our model, we are assuming that all rooms are
initially well mixed given no ventilation or
air filtration. This is because we want to make sure
that our simulation gives the safest results.
“
Experts agree that good ventilation is the most effective
and practical way to rid a space of
contaminants.
”
(Bartzokas) Without ventilation any
infected patient will in time be able to
spread the virus all around the room due to there
being no fresh intake of air nor any action toclean the air up. Many of the papers that have been referenced agree and follow this idea due
to it being the most realistic idea to follow as well.
The implementation of ventilation will
allow us to more accurately gauge the risk of having
in person instructions and measure how
severe it would be as well.
Mask Wearing
Understanding
the
capability
of
the
masks
in
this
pandemic
is
one
important
thing
in
making
epidemic
prevention
decisions
and
policies.
Many
health
authorities
suggested
that
masks
are
able
to
prevent
sick
patients
from
spreading
the
virus
to
others
by
filtering
out
the
virus
from
their
exhaled
breath.
“Results
clearly
indicate
that
wearing
surgical
masks
or
unvented
KN95
respirators
reduce
the
outward
particle
emission
rates
by
90%
and
74%
on
average
during
speaking
and
coughing,
respectively ,
compared
to
wearing
no
mask.”
These
results
further
highlight
the
importance
and
significance
of
mask
wearing
and
therefore
we
will
also
replicate
this fact into our model.
Additional Featur es (Extension)
●
Airflow
: With respect to transmission, ventilation
systems and transmission media may
be significant factors in infection risks. A study
was done in China regarding
transmissions related to air -conditioning in restaurants,
concluding that lar ge
droplet-based transmissions were likely a result of
the air -conditioning systems. The
significance of this is that airflow is a potential
risk factor for transmission/infections,
which was not considered in the one-room model. Airflow
may be an additional
parameter that is implemented in our model for determining
how likely an individual is
infected (or can transmit the virus) based on their
position relative to the direction and
speed of airflow .
●
Exhalation Activity:
Exhalation activity directly
relates to the amount of aerosol
droplets that an individual exhales towards the room.
This measure will be called quanta
emission rates ƛ
q
= Q
b
C
q
, (Q
b
= exhaled volume per
time, C
q
= quanta of infection
concentration) and will apply for various forms of
respiration.
[3]
Preliminary results and
discussions are taken from Bazant’ s paper which showcases
the dif ferent measures of Cq
or virus emissions based on the activity being done.
Methods and Results
The one-room model is scaled-down to determine transmission
and infection in a consolidated
area. The back-end assumptions and calculations are
based on the findings from the Chu
[1]
,
Chen
[2]
models, the MIT  Indoor Safety Guidelines
[3]
,
and Cambridge Model (airborne.cam)
[4]
.
Our model implements the room (physical) and viral/human
(physiological and disease)
parameters provided by the MIT  model, and uses the
assumption of a well-mixed room foraerosol transmission.
[3]
For validation, we compared our calculations to results we would get
using the airborne.cam tool
[4]
. Specifically , we found
that our own results were similar to the
results generated by the infection tool using the
Vl (viral load) = 10
8
copies/mL  input and the
same room parameters. Our model allows us to specify
the physical room parameters,
environment and viral characteristics, and occupancy .
These inputs are then used to calculate the
number of agents (out of the number specified in the
occupancy) infected after a specified
timeframe.
Our simulation will function based on a few parameters
and steps done beforehand. Firstly , the
simulation is first created by initializing the students
according to default parameters based on
the room or location that the simulation will be run
on. Then the user will also input and define
how long the model will run for . This is done so that
we will be able to see the ef fect of time
towards infections and the simulation will then be
able to track it as time goes by through steps
that are given by the input.
The model runs primarily through a series of simple
loops: firstly through the number of days
classes will be held in a sample week (1, 3, or 5),
then through each class to be attended that day
(each class being a proxy for an hour passing, options
being 3, 5, or 7 classes per day), and lastly
through a series of 5-minute timesteps during each
hour, for a total of 12 per class. At each step,
every infected student will loop through all uninfected
students and call the function
droplet_infect, which takes care of the transmission
route caused by droplets lar ger than 2
microns. The transmission rates are stored for comparison
purposes, and in the case of the
function breaking due to an empty output, transmission
is assumed to be 0 (the function handles
99.5% of potential infective cases and individual’ s
beyond the curve are ef fectively
non-infectious). One of the outputs available through
the command line is ‘test’, which displays
the distribution of transmission likelihood post-processing,
after utilizing calculations to deal
with distance, masks, and breathing rate.
We evaluated how varying levels of preventative measures
affect the output, namely masking
wearing, movement, and student activity . We defined
student activity as the level of respiratory
activity , which is related to the amount of speaking/discussions
between students. The output for
the minimal level of preventative measures is shown
in
Figur e 1
, in which masks are not used at
all, and there are no restrictions on movement and
speaking.
Figur e 2
shows the results for a
high level of preventative measures, i.e. 90% masking
usage, and some level of movement and
speaking.
Figur e 3
shows the results for the highest
level of preventative measures, that is, 100%
mask usage, no movement allowed, and restricted levels
of respiratory activity .Figur e 1.
This plot is a result of having no
preventative measures, i.e. 0% mask
wearing, unrestricted movement within the
boundaries of the room, and high student
activity (can be described as unrestricted
discussions/talking).
Figur e 2.
This plot is a result of a high level
of preventative measures, i.e. 90% mask
wearing, some level of movement within the
boundaries of the room, and semi-limited
student activity (can be described as
controlled discussions/talking).
Figur e 3.
This plot is a result of the
maximum level of preventative measures,
i.e. 100% mask wearing, no movement
within the boundaries of the room, and
very limited student activity (can be
described as highly controlled
discussions/talking and limited respiratory
activity).
Discussion and Further  Exploration:
It is important to note that there are limitations
to our study . There are many variables and
aspects that have not been taken into account or are
only limitedly discussed within the
simulation. One big aspect that we could do further
exploration on is the aerosol particle
movements. Currently in our model, we assume the room
is initially well mixed with virus
contaminated particles evenly distributed across the
whole space. Then we apply 2-D airflow
direction to simulate how air particles flow through
the room over time. However , air particle
movement and aerosol transmission in real life is
far more complicated. In our 2-D model, we
assume all the virus contaminated particles stay on
the same level and can all be exhaled in by
the students in the environment. However , in real
life, those particles may rise to the ceiling or
fall to the ground, leaving the breathing zone level
and changing the amount of virus particles
that people can exhale in. This can lar gely af fect
the transmission risk. Therefore, instead of
applying airflow in a 2-D manner , 3-D airflow direction
should be implemented to better
simulate the air particle movement.
Furthermore, our model assumes that students' exhalation
activity is constant and there is no
change between times, this is unrealistic and could
also be improved upon to make the model
more accurate. Furthermore, since the study of COVID-19
is still an ongoing research there are
still many things that we are unsure about as to the
infectiousness as well as modelling the decay
rate of the virus within the rooms. Building upon
this and the current situation with the vaccine
rollouts, we could also start to implement a vaccinated
parameter for individuals to see how
much of an ef fect vaccines have within limiting the
spread of this virus. If more resources are
available it would also be useful for users to be
able to add their own floor plans instead of using
pre-set plans that are static, as this would be able
to give a more accurate representation of risk.
Finally , unifying models such as the regional study
of COVID-19 risk could also be implemented
to further create a more representative model for
the end user .Refer ences

Introduction
 
Over the past 14 months, the world has experienced a global outbreak of the coronavirus
 
(SARS-CoV-2), a dangerous respiratory condition, and it has accumulated a total of over 117
 
million cases and over 2.6 million deaths as of March 2021. In January of 2020, COVID-19 was
 
declared as a public health emergency by the World Health Organization. At the current state of
 
loss that we have experienced as a global society, with projections of continuous damage in the
 
future, it is crucial to study and understand the virus, so we can start to contain its spread.
 
There is a multitude of factors and behaviors of this virus that need to be studied
 
extensively for us to be able to fight, slow down, and overcome this pandemic. Until the
 
technicalities of the spread, severity, and impact of the virus are understood in scientific detail,
 
we are unable to contain this disease. Many currently published studies have proven the
 
transmission of the virus when an infected person coughs or sneezes in close vicinity of others,
 
through their respiratory droplets. Some of them have also shown evidence of aerosol
 
transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
 
 
We are focussing on controlling the spread of the coronavirus, as it relates to the
 
reopening of schools for in-person education. Specifically, we are investigating infections of this
 
virus in a school bus setting, intending to simulate the spread of COVID-19, using agent-based
 
modeling. We will simulate the bus journey that school children travel through, and map out the
 
bus, with programmed virtual agents that represent the students, seating patterns in buses,
 
movement, activities, and the infection spread through the source patient(s). Agent-based
 
modeling is a useful tool to simulate real-life events so that we don’t have to create an actual
 
experiment to further study them. This avoids any risk, costs, and human effort that experiments
 
may entail. The purpose of our simulation is to be able to observe and analyze the effect of
 
changing measurable parameters such as the number of passengers, passenger movement,
 
passenger activities, and interactions, zip codes in which passengers reside, duration of the bus
 
ride for each passenger, social distancing, wearing masks and their types, risk radius, air
 changes per hour, etc. on the impact and spread of the virus, and understand how we can use
 
this knowledge to set better precautions and preparations for future group travel during this
 
pandemic, such as children going to school, and minimize disease infection risk among the
 
population. Our results will include guidelines on key parameters to focus on for safe school
 
reopening.
 
 
In the past few months, there have been a few papers and articles that have utilized
 
Agent-Based Modeling. In this article, for example, Eric Cuevas has used ABM to model Covid
 
transmission in facilities (Cuevas, 2020). They have 2 types of agents, A and B, that represent
 
currently healthy and sick people. They have 2 rules: each agent may or may not move (change
 
location) in a step, and each healthy agent has a possibility of getting the virus if they are within
 
a certain radius of a sick person. This study has not taken personal health records, immunity
 
system strength, and other factors taken into account. It is just a matter of chance for a healthy
 
agent A to get the virus from an infected agent B if they are within a certain radius. Also, there is
 
only one danger zone in this study. At a certain point, the possibility of Covid transmission drops
 
from P to 0, which is not a realistic model based on our current knowledge of the virus. This
 
paper is not taking any aerosol models into account either, meaning that if you are in a closed
 
environment with a sick person, but maintaining a distance more than their danger radius, you
 
are safe for an unlimited amount of time in that situation, which is not accurate. So we decided
 
to make our model, with specific parameters that we have designed to satisfy the needs of this
 
specific situation.
 
 
Methods
 
We chose agent-based modeling to simulate the worship event last quarter and to simulate
 
school bus trips this quarter. ABM is a type of modeling where we can simulate the actions of a
 
group of autonomous agents and assess their impact on the system. An agent in an ABM is an
 
individual or collective entity, which is the subject of the modeling effort. Each agent is defined
 
by its properties and its relationships with other agents. Agents perform autonomous decision
 
making and each one can have different characteristics, traits, and behaviors. Agents are
 
simulated to move around, make decisions, perform tasks, and interact with each other so we
 
can view and assess their effects on the system. In our case of modeling COVID-19
 
transmission in the school bus, agents are the individual students that take the bus to school in
 
the morning and back home in the evening. ABM allows interaction between these agents
 
based on a set of rules, and each agent can be given different attributes and make different
 
decisions, allowing the model to monitor and detect individual-level behaviors and interactions.
 These individual mobility and social networks are an important component in the spread of
 
diseases, and ABM can detect and capture these interactions.
 
Agent-based modeling is also able to deal with much richer and complex scenarios than
 
other types of modeling and is more flexible about simulation design. It is a useful component of
 
an epidemiological study when it is not possible to experiment, or in this case, when a real-life
 
event is simulated to analyze it. These models can be adapted to help understand how
 
populations in different settings are affected and how we should react in the case of a potential
 
disease outbreak. It not only allows comparing model output with observed system behavior, but
 
it can also be validated at the individual level by comparing the encoded behavior of each agent
 
with the behavior of actual, real agents. Agent-based modeling helps us understand how
 
micro-rules of individual behavior impact the macro-level behavior of a system. Due to this, by
 
using agent-based modeling, we can find out what adjustments to make in micro-level individual
 
behavior to control the course of macro-level events, such as the spread of an infectious
 
disease like COVID-19 being impacted by individuals’ behaviors such as sitting patterns, social
 
distancing, or choosing to wear masks.
 
To initialize the model, we create a bus with certain features replicating a real school bus
 
that we measured thoroughly on a field trip that happened in early February. These features
 
include the seating arrangement, number of rows and columns of seats, dimensions of seats
 
(width, length, height), dimensions of spaces within the bus (the aisle, legroom, etc.), and the
 
length, width, and arc of the ceiling of the bus to measure the inside volume. We also recorded
 
the arrangement of windows, alongside their dimensions to more accurately calculate the airflow
 
rate during the trips. Once we have the bus initialized, we need to add our initial agents to the
 
model. Each passenger agent has certain parameters that are set in the model initialization
 
step. The main parameters here are the health indicator, the location of the agent in the bus,
 
their daily schedule at school, their route id, and their bus stop id.
 
We do all this through the Mesa-Geo library. To initialize the model, we make an agent
 
class with the features named above. We are using a bus class, which is a subclass to a
 
Classroom type. The bus is similar to a classroom in many ways, such as having a limited
 
volume with a certain air change per hour rate. They both have seats which students can take
 
and spend some amount of time during various activities. At the same time, the bus needs
 
some extra parameters, which led us to make it a separate class of its own. Each bus also
 
needs to be assigned to a route, each bus needs to pick up and drop off students at certain
 
times and locations.
 The data we use to integrate with our bus model for our simulations comes from the San
 
Diego Unified School District database. This dataset contains information about school bus trips
 
in the San Diego district. We extract information about routes, timings, stops, locations, schools,
 
and the number of students at each stop, for trips to and from the schools. This dataset included
 
over 1100 different routes. For each route, we had a route ID, type of route (with or without
 
wheelchair), and addresses for each stop, including the school it goes to. For each of these
 
stops, we have address information, Thomas Brothers location, time the bus reaches the stop,
 
and the number of students it picks up or drops off at that stop.  By using spatial data
 
manipulation services like ArcGIS and GeoPandas, we were able to find geometric locations for
 
all of these stops in our dataset, and include the geocoded locations in our data. Most of our key
 
parameters related to bus trips, such as trip time, the number of students at each stop, etc., are
 
imported from this dataset, into our model.
 
We make changes in some of our parameters for the simulations, to be able to measure
 
the impact of that change on the spread of the disease and try to pinpoint important factors to
 
help slow that spread. These parameters include the details discussed in the previous
 
paragraph about the San Diego Unified School District dataset. They also include different
 
seating arrangements based on social distancing guidelines, mask-wearing probabilities, types
 
of masks used, and probabilities of different activities and interactions between the students in
 
the bus.
 
 
Results
 
During our simulations, as students spend more time on the bus, the density of the virus
 
increases in the bus atmosphere, and that results in a higher rate of transmission of the virus.
 
We keep track of infection counts and rates during each of our simulations, and then we
 
produce graphs of the changes in infections concerning key parameters changes, to show the
 
impact of that particular parameter on the spread of the virus, over time and different
 
simulations. We can simulate bus trips of children going to school, and our further analysis is
 
collecting and analyzing infection data from these trips, based on various key factors.
  
As an example, here we are simulating a real route (Route:T017  BA in SDUSD dataset)
 
with different sets of guidelines and recording the different outcomes. At first, we had all the
 
windows rolled up, A/C is off, and no one is wearing masks or practicing social distancing. In
 
this example, we see how dangerous a single bus ride could be, as our initial 2 sick people
 
infected an additional 13 students, for a total of 15 sick people (2 infectious and 13 exposed). In
 
this example, 2/26 (7.7%) of our population was infectious and 13/26 (50%) ended up being
 
exposed. This would be a similar outcome to the worship bus that we simulated last quarter
 
(
​
Shen, Ye
​
; et al,2020). We could also see that as time goes on and the density of the virus in
 
this closed system increases, the rate at which new students get exposed to the virus increases
 
as well.
 
 
We then repeated the same route’s simulation with 90% of the students wearing masks,
 
but still without any outside air circulation or social distancing within the bus. In this scenario, we
 
see that the spread is much slower, but it still happens within the 58-minute trip. In this example,
 
2/26 (7.7%) of our population was infectious and 4/26 (15%) ended up being exposed.
 
 
 
Finally, we repeated the experiment with 100% of the students properly wearing masks,
 
windows rolled down, and students seated in a zigzag pattern where they maximize their
 
distances. In this simulation, none of the 24 healthy students got exposed to the virus in this
 
58-minute bus ride to school.
 
 
Conclusions
 
By simulating different scenarios, we realized that certain actions would have certain effects on
 
slowing the spread of COVID-19 in San Diego school buses. Firstly, the windows of the buses
 
must be open so that the air changes per hour hit values higher than 20 on average. At that
 
stage, the chances of getting the virus through the aerosol model minimize to the point where it
 
is negligible. The second most important conclusion was that to overcome droplet transmission,
 
social distancing within the bus is very important. By putting more distance between the sick
 
and the healthy students, we lower the chances of transmission substantially. On top of this
 
distance, we need our masks more than ever to block the droplets that move towards us while a
 
sick person around is breathing, talking, coughing, or sneezing.
 
 
By combining all the mentioned procedures, we can minimize the spread of covid in the
 
buses by a lot. Wearing masks at all times, keeping the windows open, spacing out the students
 
with the zigzag seating pattern, and preventing any close interaction between students can get
 
us a long way in battling Covid-19.
 
 
 
It is worth mentioning that all these precautions limit the spread in a single bus ride, but
 
our findings when we simulated longer periods (as a part of the School-ABM model and not
 
included in this submission) showed other important measures that need to be taken. The most
 
important of them is assigning seats to the students so that throughout the semester they would
 
always take the same seat and neighbor the same set of students.
 
But how would that help? Well, let’s imagine all the students in the same bus get to the school,
 
hop off and go to their classes. These students get to interact with many other people in
 
different classes, have a chance of transmitting the disease, and then get back to the bus. If
 
they are sitting next to the same set of students, the spread will be more localized to those
 
neighboring students, whereas if they change their seats and neighbors every day, they could
 
spread this virus to many more people in the same bus.
 
As a result, assigning the same seats to the students would not make a huge change in
 
the spread rate in a single trip, however, it makes a big difference in the spread rate of the virus
 
through the semester as each new trip would provide more possible hosts for the virus to go to.
 
In conclusion, the following set of procedures would provide the most safety to the
 
students in San Diego buses:
 
●
Each student must: wear masks and keep them on at all times during the ride, limit their
 
interactions with other students as much as possible, avoid drinking or eating on the bus.
 
●
Each bus must: keep the windows open at all times and not let the windows be closed,
 
have A/C off or if A/C is on, have it on outside air circulation mode.
 
●
Each school must: Assign seats to students at the beginning of the semester, make sure
 
the students who go through similar schedules during the day are matched to take the
 
same buses as much as possible.

1 T raﬀic Policing and It’s Relationship With Income
1.1 Introduction
Policing is a rather mixed affair hinging on a number of different factors with some encounters
being relatively short and simple while others are more tense and hostile. There are many different
reasons for why police make the decisions that they make, either rightfully or wrongfully, many
of which aren’t directly observable or easily determined within police data. Some of these factors
may include suspicion of drivers doing illegal activity, misdemeanors, or having unconscious bias
against individuals that appear to fit their mental description of what a criminal may look like.
While racial prejudice is one of the more striking factors to point at when considering how or why
encounters between individuals and police oﬀicers go differently, decisions seemly motivated by
racial bias may potentially be actually due to social class or perceived social class of the individual
rather than their race.
For police traﬀic stops and searches, the assumption here is that a police oﬀicer is much less likely
to ticket or search a person they consider to be an upstanding citizen. They would be much more
likely to search a lower class person who they wouldn’t regard as highly. Police oﬀicers would be
less likely to suspect a person of drug or other contraband crimes if they perceive the person to be
middle or upper class rather than lower class. Based on an oﬀicer’s biases they may end up fishing
for contraband much more than they should against these drivers, wasting the time of both the
oﬀicer and the driver as well as potentially increasing the tension or distrust between the drivers
and oﬀicers.
2 Analysis Based on Service Area Income
The dataset we are using is the San Diego Police Stops Data from the Stanford Open Policing
Dataset. This dataset gives us data from 2015 to 2019 for all police traﬀic stops in San Diego
county. The county is split geographically into a number of smaller service areas where oﬀicers
may be stationed to. For this analysis we will be focusing on the search rate of drivers in order to
determine if police are biased in their searches based off the driver’s percieved income level.
The first methods we used to to judge a driver’s percived income is using the average income of the
service area the police stopped them in. This might not be entirely accurate for say drivers who
aren’t from a service area they get stopped in, but what is important here is the police’s perception
of the driver’s income level, not necessarily how much the driver actually makes. It should give us
a general idea of how police might behave differently in different service areas as well.
In order to get average income of service areas, we used census data of San Diego County which
contained information on average income for each geographical census block. Then we joined the
1correct census blocks that fit or were a part of a service area and took the average from those census
blocks for each service area. This is still a rough estimation given how large service areas can be
compared to individual census blocks, but overall should be close to the actual average.
In order to get the average income of each service area here we used income data from the 2010 US
census. Then we geospacially joined the service areas and the census tracts and got the average of
all census tracts within each service area to get the average income of each service area.
Here we have each Service Area represented as a bubble and we can see that police searched lower
income service areas at a higher rate and that the higher a service area’s income the less likely
that drivers will be searched. One potential reason is that police treat lower income service areas
differently and believe that they have a higher chance of having contraband and thus search drivers
there more often. Or maybe the police don’t expect higher income areas to have drivers with
contraband.
There may be two outliers below the curve at around 70k, but looking at it geospacially it can be
more easily explained later.
2The graph above is the percent of searched drivers that were arrested by service area income. You
see that the percent of searched people arrested actually goes up at higher income, so they are
searched more and aren’t arrested as often afterwards. This gives more evidence that lower income
people are getting searched much more than they should be. Another possibility is that police
might not feel a need to search people in more expensive service areas without a higher degree of
suspision or certainty of contraband or arrest-worthy activity.
3In these geospacial plots, we can see the service areas with the lowest average income near the
bottom right of San Diego county. And we see the 5 areas with the highest number of searches also
in that area clustered together. This could also point to those 5 clusered Service Areas being more
heavily profiled or discriminated against.
The two outliers from before are the ones at the border of San Diego county, where different types
of policing may take place for drivers crossing the border.
3 V eil of Darkness by Service Area Income
Using service area income like in the last section, a technique known as the veil of darkness will be
employed.
This technique limits the range of searches to all searches from an hour before twilight to an hour
after twilight. After twiight, police cannot as easily racially profile and stop minority drivers since
they would not be able to see the color of the driver’s skin. By doing this, we set up a treatment
and control group with the treatment being the level of visibility where one group of police oﬀicers
could racially profile drivers and the other group wouldn’t be as able to. By limiting it to an hour
before twilight to an hour after twilight, we are trying to hold other factors constant such as what
drivers may be out on the road and differences in policing behavior at different times of day.
By adding the income of the service areas, we may be able to see a pattern emerge in where
this racial profiling is taking place. Different income service areas may have larger populations of
African American and Hispanic residents, so racial profiling may be easier for police despite the
constraint so we may see less of a difference in those service areas. For this analysis, it made sense
to divide the data into three income brackets, and it was settled to be under 80k, 80k to 110k and
over 110k. This gets us a low, middle and high grouping where each has a similar amount of service
4areas.
We are also going to be keeping track of the power of each sample, in order to help note how much
confidence we can have in our statistic when we get small sample sizes. This gives us the percent
chance that the difference we get is actually accurate or if it could just be due to randomness
inherent to smaller sample sizes.

After grouping the service areas into three categories based on income for low, medium and high
income, there seems to be no statistically siginificant evidence of racial profiling shown through
the veil of darkness technique.
Note that veil of darkness only finds explicit racial profiling of specific drivers, so for example
there may still be a possibility that racial profiling based on the service areas where police may
expect the general residence to be heavily minority.
4 Car Price as a Proxy for Driver W ealth
In order to further our analysis on police stop data, we wanted to explore how police perceive a
driver’s wealth, and how that could influence their decisions to stop, search or arrest different
drivers. From the Stanford Open Police Project, we found a dataset that includes stop data from
San Antonio, Texas, with the make, model and year of the car stopped. I wanted to join this onto
a dataset to get the price of the car that was stopped. We found a Kelly Blue Book (KBB)
dataset that we could join onto to get car prices. However, several potential problems soon arose:
the Texas data abbreviated the make and model of the car. For example, a 2015 Toyota Tundra
7would be 2015 TOY TUND, whereas KBB uses full names. After some consideration, I elected to
go with the KBB data, as it was more complete and included more makes and models of cars.
The Texas data includes over 20,000 unique year, make and model cars, and the KBB data
provides price data for 17,651 unique year make and model cars. I first tried to use difflib to find
closest matches directly between these two datasets, but the code was too ineﬀicient and would
take many hours to run. Difflib.get_close_matches() returns a “close enough” match based on
the number of similarities it can find between a string and a list of comparison strings.
To work around the large datasets and runtime of get_close_matches, I first made a dictionary
that matches the car make as listed in the texas dataset with the car makes in the KBB dataset
by hand. The resulting dictionary had 44 matches. I then made an empty dictionary to hold the
price of each make and model. Then, for each car in the Kelly Blue Book data, I found the closest
match in the texas data to the full car name, (year, make, model), then set that closest match to
be a key in the empty dictionary. I then set the value for that key to be the price from the KBB
data. I converted that dictionary into a dataset, cleaned it and gave it column names, then
merged it onto the texas dataset to get a dataset that has 65217 rows. Overall, the quality of the
join is decent, but leaves much to be desired. After cleaning the Texas dataset, it had 873,113
rows with car data in them, but the join reduced that to just 65,217 rows, a reduction of 92%.
Even though there is still plenty of data to be analyzed, it shows that this join method is far from
optimal, and is something that can be improved upon in the future. A working hypothesis on why
so much data could not be matched is due to a mismatch between KBB and Texas datasets, with
KBB not having some cars mentioned in the Texas Dataset. It could also be due to the messy
nature of the Texas Dataset, with some cars having wildly incorrect ages, making it impossible to
find a similar match with KBB data. After obtaining a joined dataset that includes the police
traﬀic stops and the price of the car stopped, I binned the prices of the cars into three categories
to see how search and arrest rates would differ between them. Cheap cars are less than 10,000
dollars, medium cars are between 10,000 dollars and 35,000 dollars, and expensive cars are
anything more expensive than 35,000 dollars. What I found was that cheap cars had much higher
arrest and search rates when compared to expensive and medium priced cars. Cheap cars had an
arrest rate of 0.237%, and a search rate of 0.77%, when compared to expensive and medium priced
cars, which had arrest rates between 0.11% and 0.13%, and search rates between 0.26 and 0.276%,
a significant decrease in rates that is indicative of some bias in policing towards cheaper cars.
To dive deeper into the correlation between driver wealth and police action, I looked into any
potential correlations between the average car price in each district and the search and arrest
rates in each district.
8After plotting these variables, I found strong negative correlations between them, showing that as
car price increases, the search rate decreases.
We can see here in the graph above that as the average price of a car and the average income of a
district increases, we see the search rate begin to shrink. To further investigate this correlation, I
ran a logistic regression on these variables: car price, car age, income of the area the car was
stopped, and the product of the car price and income of the area to predict the search and arrest
rates.

10We can see that in both models, each coeﬀicient is close to zero. We can calculate the odds ratio
that associates each variable with whether that driver will be searched or arrested or not. For
each coeﬀicient we see that:
Variable Search Rate Odds Arrest Rate Odds
Price 0.9997 0.9997
Age 0.9235 0.8716
Income 0.999 1.000
Price * Income 1 1
This means that for each increase in price of car, or age of car, or income of the area, will
multiply the odds of being searched or arrested by the corresponding value in the table above.
For example, each dollar increase will multiply the odds of being searched by 0.9997, which is a
slightly downwards trend. We can see that the age of the car has the largest downwards trends,
with multipliers of 0.9235 and 0.8716 for search odds and arrest odds respectively.
In order to compare how drivers were being treated based on their cars more directly, we looked
at the cumulative distribution function, or CDF, of the prices of cars that were searched and the
prices of all cars that were stopped. The cumulative distribution function by car price will let us
see what proportion of cars in the data are less than or equal to any given price in the data. So
for example if 50 percent of cars were under 15k in price, then that would give us a y-value of .5
and an x value of 15k. So not only will this give us the general price distribution of all cars in the
populations, but it also lets us see how well the searched and stopped distributions match.
KstestResult(statistic=0.26425152201873564, pvalue=9.868332295331303e-19)
11With a p-value extremely close to 0, there is statistically significant evidence of that lower priced
cars searched at a higher proportion than they are stopped.
Looking at the Search and Stopped CDF by difference value, we see that both hispanic and white
drivers match up closely with the overall CDF difference, but Black drivers have a sudden dip
around 10000 and overall have less of a search and stop CDF difference. This is most likely due to
us not having enough data as with only 42 Black drivers total that were searched, we have a few
potential hypotheses on how this could happen in general.
One possibility could be that low income Black drivers are less likely to give consent to a police
oﬀicer to search their car, and so police cannot legally search them without some other reason to
justify their search. This could have some merit in some areas where Black drivers and police
oﬀicers have a more tense relationship or have a history of bias against Black drivers. Or even
news report of events of police brutality and discriminatory practice of police against minorities
could lead to Black drivers not wanting to allow police to search their car for a reasonable fear of
being discriminated against.
Another possibility, although one that we’d suspect to be highly unlikely in this case, is that a
police oﬀicer’s decision to search Black drivers specifically is not as affected by the price of the
car. It could be possible then that searches car CDF would match the stop CDF if and only if the
police oﬀicer do not care or account the price of the car in their decision to search specifically
because the driver is Black.
The general bias towards searching cars that are of a lower price is still mostly prevalent across
the groups of drivers.
Similar to Veil of Darkness using Service Areas, we can use veil of darkness while grouping cars of
different price ranges in order to control for the effect of car price on racial profiling.
12Unfortunately, the downside to using the veil of darkness here is that there isn’t quite enough
data in the dataset to come to any strong conclusions. The data was divided into three groups,
under 10k, 10k to 20k, and above 20k.

white 300 0.482315 230 0.504386 0.309223 0.632339
Based on the data we have still, there isn’t any statistically significant evidence for racial profiling
after factoring in car price. While there does seem to be a statistically significant decrease in the
stop rate of white drivers between 10k and 20k, it may be more likely that is due to some other
confounding factor or factors.
We also have very low power in our statistics for black drivers because of the low amount of black
drivers here, so we cannot draw any notable conclusions for or against racial profiling in any of
these groups.
5 F eedback Loop Simulation
When we are preparing the Stanford Open Policing Data, we try to rule out columns that we
think are not features that a police oﬀicer can come up with at the time of the stop if they wish
to use our model. We decided to stick with 9 features, all of which are reasonable in that a police
oﬀicer is able to pull up all the information necessary to input into the model. For example, we
have the service area, a police oﬀicer should know which area they are currently assigned to, we
have race/sex/age that can be pulled up from the license plate (only correct if the person driving
15is who the car is registered to), and day of the week.
While cleaning and preparing our data, we are also trying to make our label/prediction much
better. For example if our initial data had been a search but there was no contraband found then
in our newly created label we would have a 0 meaning there should not have been a search in the
first place.
So how our model works is that it takes in the first n months (lets use 3 in this example) and
trains the model on those first 3 months of the dataset. Then we take the next 3 months (Months
4-6) and predict on that. When we have those predictions we then replace the actual labels of
Months 4-6 with the predicted labels and we refit the model with Months 4-6 and the predicted
labels and then we take the 3 months after (Months 7-9) and do the same until we reach the last
months of the dataset. We evaluate our model using recall and precision, as well as accuracy. The
current Classifier we are using is LDA, but we will keep trying out different models to see which
works best. When we get predictions, we do some modification to get better Y’s. If the model
predicted 1, and it is actually 0, we change the label to a 0. If the model predicted 1 and it is
actually 1, we keep the label of 1. If the model predicts 0 and it’s actually 0, we keep the label of
0. Finally, if the model predicts 0 and it is actually 1, then we flip the label to 0.
We see that our model is predicting to search more white people than black people regardless of
having race as a feature or not while training the model. We believe that this is happening
because only ~19% of the data we have is black drivers. It is also predicting searches mostly in
service area 120. This service area consists of La Jolla, Torrey Pines, Pacific Beach, and Mission
Beach. Although this is not a feedback loop that deals with race, the fact that searches are mainly
being predicted in this area could be indirectly correlated to the race of the drivers in this area.
1617The 3 graphs we have here are for when we give the model race as one of the features as well as
only have it take in 3 months at a time. Between recall and precision, we see they kind of have a
similar pattern, they are 0 for 3 iterations towards the beginning and then they both end up at 0
for both black and white drivers. The precision/recall overall is low toward the early iterations
and then it gradually goes up in the later iterations.
If this model were to be deployed, we would expect police oﬀicers to use it if they had someone
stopped and were trying to figure out if they should search them or not. The inputs to the model
would all be available to the oﬀicer performing the stop, therefore the model should be able to
give a good prediction of whether or not the oﬀicer should search or not. We came to the
conclusion that there was no positive or negative feedback loop happening in our model. The
recall and precision graphs do not give us enough evidence in order to support if there is a
feedback loop or not.
18We also took a look at search rates after each iteration, we saw that black search rate was for the
most part always higher than white search rate, but as we go through the iterations we see that it
stays constant and does not increase (at times there are some spikes). If a negative feedback loop
did exist, we would see the search rate increase.
6 Conclusions
There is evidence of search rates being correlated with a driver’s percieved income based on the
service area or the price of their car. We also see that these drivers may be getting unfairly
searched when you look at the arrest rates after searches or that police may be fishing for
contraband much more than they should be. There is also evidence that cheaper cars get searched
more often than they are stopped and that this trend is seen across the three racial demographics
that we looked at.
In conclusion, we have found that police search and arrest rates have a significant correlation with
the perception of a driver’s wealth. As the average income of an area and the average car price of
an area increases, the search and arrest rates of those areas decrease accordingly. After running
logistic regression on a car’s price, age, and income of the area it was stopped in, we find that
each variable has small yet significant impacts on the probability of a driver being stopped.
In terms of racial profiling, even after controlling for service area income and car price seperately,
we were unable to find any notable evidence of racial profiling of stops. While this is interesting
and we see income potentially playing a larger effect than racial bias in this data, these results are
only limited to San Diego and San Antonio and we might expect to see different results if we were
to look at other cities with large minority populations or those with histories of racial profiling by
police.
197 Discussion
Overall we have seen some evidence of correlation between a driver’s income and the likelihood of
them being searched. However we are not able to draw many strong conclusions due to an overall
lack of data.
Car price does seem like a reasonable proxy for driver wealth and using car make and model to
find them has been able to get us car prices with good accuracy. However there are actually very
few data sets that give car make and model consistently that we could find, with the datasets
that do provide it only having it for roughly 20 percent of the data on average. If more policing
data had this statistic though we think that there is more that can be uncovered.
Something else to consider is having the service areas be more publicly available in the form of
shape files. One issue we ended up running into using the San Antonio data were that they had
their data groupped into six larger areas or hundreds smaller areas, neither one was really as
useful as they could potentially be because the number of stops and searches in each individual
area were too small to get statistics from or were grouped so much that it made it diﬀicult to
determine a meaningful trend.

Abstract
Financial news is an important source for peo-
ple to learn information in financial field, such
as the variation in stock market. News could
also be a key factor to forecast change in the
stock market. In this report, we introduce dif-
ferent methods we tried to predict the change of
stock price by using financial news, including
Bag-of-Words, AutoPhrase, LSTM, and BERT.
Our experiments demonstrate that BERT out-
performs other models.
1 Introduction
Nowadays, we are seeing a great amount of data
generated everywhere. The Data will bring us
both challenges and opportunities. As AutoPhrase
(Shang et al., 2017) is developed, an automated
and domain-independent phrase mining method,
we see its potential to be used on extracting quality
phrases from numerous daily financial news and
editorials, to improve the current data prediction
model using bag-of-words and other conventions as
its entry. This experiment could be very promising
since it can be a quick classifier of long text reports.
Analysts then may use the result as a supportive
reason for future investments. Thus, adapting this
method could improve the efficiency with the same
accuracy if used properly.
In this project, we will give a report of model
analysis among conventional methods and Au-
toPhrase on predicting the change of stock price
(increase or decrease). We will also include
the comparison between the performances of Au-
toPhrase and deep learning methods on predicting
the change of the stock price.
2 Dataset
2.1 Financial news dataset
We mainly use reports and news from Yahoo Fi-
nance as the input of our models. We found articles
that only mention a single company to prevent thenoise. For our input, there are two main types of
articles: analyst report and press release news. We
searched for the articles under “press releases” and
“research reports” categories on the web page of a
company and used beautiful soup to scrape the arti-
cles. We plan to collect news about 30 companies
and 30-50 articles within the past one year for each
company to test our models.
2.2 Stock price dataset
Our stock price dataset is from a kaggle project
that updates all stock prices regularly and has been
verified. The raw dataset covers 1657 major nasdaq
stock prices from their beginning to present. We
are selecting one at a time, and compute its 5-day-
average, 10-day-average and so on from the time
a particular piece of news is released. We started
with Apple Inc. to test our methodology and to try
automations. (Mooney, 2020)
2.3 Positive and negative words in financial
news dataset
We utilized the “Financial positive and negative
terms list” created by Bill McDonald. This dataset
contains common positive and negative words in
financial news. The dataset contains 354 positive
words and 2350 negative words. It helps us to
determine the attitudes of financial news articles.
2.4 FinancialPhraseBank dataset
This dataset contains the sentiments for financial
news headlines from the perspective of a retail in-
vestor. And it contains two columns, ""Sentiment""
and ""News Headline"". The sentiment can be nega-
tive, neutral or positive. (Malo et al., 2013)
3 Models
In this section, we introduce each model, including
the methods, algorithm, and details about them.3.1 Baselines
We used the Bag-of-Words method to generate the
baseline model. After removing stopwords, remov-
ing punctuation, and stemming the text, we per-
formed Bag-of-Words to get the top n words with
the highest frequencies. Then we compare the ex-
tracted words with positive and negative words in
the financial news dataset. If the number of posi-
tive words is larger than that of negative words in a
document, we give the output as “True”. Below is
how the model works:
1 #create a dictionary (dict) that
contains each word (key) in the
document with the number of times it
appears in the text (value)
2 positive_word_count = 0
3 negative_word_count = 0
4 for each high frequency word do
5 if word in positive_word_list
6 positive_word_count += dict[word]
7 else if word in negative_word_list
8 negative_word_count += dict[word]
9
10 if positive_word_count >
negative_word_count
11 Output: True
12 else
13 Output: False
3.2 AutoPhrase Model
After building the baseline model, we tried to ex-
plore more methods to predict the change of stock
price. Instead of using native methods like Bag-of-
Words to extract the words in articles, we consid-
ered to extract high-quality phrases. Therefore, we
utilized AutoPhrase to perform phrase mining tasks.
AutoPhrase is a framework that extracts quality
phrases from text (Shang et al., 2017). After run-
ning AutoPhrase, we will get the top high-quality
phrases in an article with their scores. We will then
use the positive and negative word lists to deter-
mine the attitude of the words. Finally, we use the
scores and their attitude to predict the stock price
change. Below is how we get the score for each
extracted phrase:
1 for each high quality phrase do
2 Split phrase into words
3 coefficients = list()
4 for each word do
5 if word in positive_word_list
6 Append 1 to coefficients
7 else if word in
negative_word_list
8 Append -1 to coefficients
9 if sum of coefficients = 0
10 coefficient = 0
11 else if sum of coefficients >= 1
12 coefficient = 113 else
14 coefficient = -1
15 score of phrase = original score *
coefficient
By following the method above, we get an adjusted
score for each phrase. We then train an SVM clas-
sifier to make the prediction.
3.3 Doc2vec and LSTM Model
Given that the board of the company will always
try to make a development plan, no matter short
term or long term, we know that there might be
some connections between each financial report
in the analysis of these financial decisions. Thus,
we tried to use the Doc2vec model to create nu-
merical representation of documents. Compared
to the Bag-of-Words model, it was designed to ad-
dress the problem of word order and syntax that
BoW has, and after the Doc2vec model is trained,
we can also fit in a new sentence and predict its
paragraph vector, and that will be very useful in
our stock price movement prediction because that
means every time we have a new financial article,
we can find its corresponding paragraph vector and
used as the input for our prediction model. We
are going to use LSTM for our prediction model.
LSTM stands for Long Short Term Memory Net-
work, and it’s a special version of Recurrent Neural
Network(RNN). As shown in the graph(Figure 1)
below:
Figure 1: Work Flow of the LSTM Model
The LSTM architecture has a large range of mod-
ules for each time step update, and the output of
each step update is controlled by a series of gates,
which either add or remove the information from
being updated to the cell state. With that being said,
we will first obtain our vector embedding matrix
from our Doc2vec model, and then we will fit in the
embedding matrix as a weight to train our LSTM
model, and from that we are able to predict themovement of stock price from specific time span
given the financial news documents. But the prob-
lem right now is that we do not have a large enough
news article dataset to do proper neural network
training, and the performance that we got from the
current dataset that consists of a 30-ish number of
financial reports is relatively trivial. However, our
team has already found a new way to scrape the
news articles and financial reports from the web-
site and we should be able to test the model on
a large scale of news sources. Even though we
don’t have the ideal result on our own dataset, we
did test the model on a sentiment analysis dataset
(Malo et al., 2013) that was found online consist-
ing of only the financial news headlines, and a
sentiment(neutral, positive, negative) assigned by
a retail investor. And this dataset really shows us
that Doc2vec and LSTM model has the potential to
work with financial news and gives relatively good
classification on binary labels.
3.4 BERT Model
While the main advantage of LSTM is that it keeps
the long-term dependencies, BERT does more so
we chose it to be the state of the art of our project.
Upon our findings, we find that BERT is extremely
helpful on our sentiment analysis model and good
for our stock prediction. We could see from a typi-
cal BERT process illustrated by Devlin et al. The
process(Figure 2) is in two parts. The pre-training
process is using a model that can learn language
well in an unsupervised way. By using the Masked
Language Model, or MLM, BERT is able to read
from left to right at the same time it reads right
from left. This feature enables BERT to learn a
sentence but not to learn a sequence of words. Be-
sides, BERT is also implemented by NSP, or Next
Sentence Prediction. This algorithm does a classifi-
cation problem: if the some sentence B is following
sentence A correctly, which guarantees an overall
paragraph understanding by linking every sentence
together. By bringing MLM, and NSP, we will have
a very good understanding of the whole paragraph,
knowing almost the true meaning of each word,
sentence, and all. Lastly, since BERT is built on
transformers, it can be accelerated by GPU execu-
tive units by doing parallel computing, which not
only provides us learning performance, but also
lower the computing requirements by improving
its efficiency. BERT is also the first NLP technique
that relies on self-attention mechanisms. This gives
Figure 2: BERT Process Representation
BERT the ability to determine the change of mean-
ing of the words. As Lutslevch suggests in the edi-
torial, the word “is” often changes meaning when
the paper goes. BERT, however, could often make
a good association with the correct one. “ That
boy says the animal beside his mom is a cat. He
is correct. It is an American Short-hair cat.” In
these sentences, the word “is” changes its meaning
three times and BERT is designed for distinguish-
ing these.(Devlin et al., 2019)
In the second phrase, BERT provides an ex-
tremely simple way to do the fine-tuning pro-
cess. By adding one layer upon, one could already
achieve a desirable output. Our approach is based
on finBERT transformer from Hugging Face. After
configuring the required packages and loaded the
model, one should expect similar result and accu-
racy as writer’s. The model we used is trained by
Financial Phrase Bank by Malo et al.(Malo et al.,
2013) This phrase bank is designed to train a finan-
cial sentiment analysis model, so we seeing it is a
suitable model for our stock prediction pretrained
model. As it is already tuned for analyzing sen-
timent for the financial texts, it could be mapped
to our stock predictions situation. Since we are
lacking resources of fetching enough news to pre-
train this model particularly in our case, we have
to choose accept this model and do classification
upon this.
4 Results
4.1 Baselines
We experimented with different n and tried to pre-
dict the change of stock price of Apple Inc. after
5 days, 10 days, and 30 days of the news pub-
lished date. We used 30 articles to test the model.
The graph(Figure 3) below shows the change of
accuracy. We could see that the baseline model
performs the best for n=2000 and the stock price
changes after 5 days, with an accuracy of 0.57.For the prediction of the stock price change after
15 and 30 days, we did not get good results. In
our other model, we will use more sophisticated
models to achieve better accuracy.
Figure 3: Performance of baseline model
4.2 AutoPhrase Model
We trained an SVM classifier with 100 news arti-
cles about Apple Inc. and predicted the stock price
change by using 30 articles. The results we got
for predicting the stock price change 5(Figure 4),
15(Figure 5), and 30 days(Figure 6) after the new
publication date was 0.6, 0.58, 0.55, respectively.
We have also created the confusion matrices for the
results. In the graphs below, we could see that the
model performs relatively well when the ground
truth is 1. However, one problem is that the ground
truth labels we used were imbalanced, as there’re
more 1s than 0s in the ground truth labels. We
could increase the size of data if we have more
time.

model for stock price change after 5 days
Figure 5: Confusion matrix of prediction by AutoPhrase
model for stock price change after 15 days
Figure 6: Confusion matrix of prediction by AutoPhrase
model for stock price change after 30 days
4.3 Doc2vec and LSTM Model
We first tried to apply the Doc2vec and LSTM
model on 30 financial news documents and stock
price dataset, and then we predict the change of
stock price of Apple Inc. after 5 days(Figure 7),
10 days(Figure 8), and 20 days(Figure 9) from the
news published date. And the accuracy we got on
the test set was around 0.6. We also obtained con-
fusion matrices for these 3 categories respectively.
Although the accuracy for this dataset might
not represent the true case due to the insufficient
amount of training dataset we have, we still ap-
ply the model to a larger dataset we found online
for sentiment analysis of financial news headlines.
And note that it also has the binary labels where 0
stands for positive, 1 for neutral, and 2 for negative.
And here below are the confusion matrix(Figure 10)
for this classification process and accuracy(Figure
15) and loss(Figure 16) curves over the 50 epochs.
From these results, we can see that the confusionFigure 7: Confusion matrix of prediction by LSTM
model for stock price change after 5 days
Figure 8: Confusion matrix of prediction by LSTM
model for stock price change after 10 days
matrix is acting normally, and the model gives an
accuracy of 0.66 for the test set and 0.67 for the val-
idation set. Therefore, we confirmed the model’s
capability of predicting binary labels based on fi-
nancial news dataset.
4.4 BERT Model
Built on finBERT model, we shall expect any text
corpora has a output like Figure 11. Logit is the
Figure 9: Confusion matrix of prediction by LSTM
model for stock price change after 20 days
Figure 10: LSTM Classification Confusion Matrix
possibility that the model predicts of [positive, neg-
ative, neutral] for each sentence. And the predic-
tion label is determined by logit where simply takes
the largest possibility as the label. We also have
a weighted sentiment score accordingly. We se-
lect the sentiment score and prediction label to
create one extra machine learning layer to predict
the stock price trend.(pro)
We can see from the confusion matrices(Figure
12, 13, 14) that the predictions are fairly accurate.Figure 11: Raw Output of finBERT.predict
Though the dataset is too small to be conclusive, we
already have a great trend that the true predictions
are much higher than false predictions no matter
the labels distribution goes. This reveals BERT’s
potential to outperform any other existing models
and may surprise us after a more thorough fine
tuning with more datasets. Please note that BERT
model are based on a smaller subset dataset than
other models, since finBERT is not supporting GPU
at our end which takes disproportionate time, and
the running results are inconclusive.

5 Discussion & Conclusion
In sum, we have worked on combination of conven-
tional machine learning models, the AutoPhrase
models. We have also worked on Deep Learning
models like LSTMs, and BERT. In our preliminary
analysis by far, we’ve seen that AutoPhrase has
roughly the same performance as LSTMs. And
BERT outperformed LSTMs, and all other models.
However, we do see limitations that this BERT sen-
timent analysis model is not perfect for stock price
prediction. There are still works to do to enhance
its performance, a current 72% to as high as 85%
Figure 13: Confusion Matrix of BERT by month.predict
Figure 14: Confusion Matrix of BERT by quar-
ter.predict
(Wells, 2020), which is an theoretical result after
we are able to acquire diversified data. We may
also take steps further to run simulations of this
predictor and to feed it into RNN models, which
we will continue working on.
The model comparison does not have a solid
conclusion set in stone. Due to our team works
on this project in the middle of transition of x86
to ARM, some packages are not applicable and
costs extra time, which is the main reason that the
models are tested on different test set. At this point,
we are expecting deep learning model, especially
BERT works better in this task. We will continue
working on this project and expand it to a broaderselection of stocks.

Abstract
Phrase mining is a useful tool to extract quality phrases from large text corpora.
Previous work on this topic, such as AutoPhrase, demonstrates its effectiveness
against baseline methods by using precision-recall as a metric. Our goal is to
extend this work by analyzing how AutoPhrase phrases change over time, as well
as how phrases are connected with each other by using network visualizations.
This will be done through exploratory data analysis, along with a classification
model utilizing individual phrases to predict a specific year range.
1 Introduction
Phrase mining is the process of utilizing automated programs for extracting important and high-
quality phrases from bodies of text. These phrases can be used in a variety of ways, from extracting
major ideas from customer reviews or key points from a scientific paper. However, phrase mining
has historically been done with complicated linguistic analyzers trained on specific data, meaning
that it is difficult to expand to a larger scope without significant additional human effort. As a way
to mine phrases in an expandable way, in any language or domain, AutoPhrase was created. With
AutoPhrase, it is possible to input any text corpora without the need for human labels, allowing for
much faster extraction of phrases in a variety of documents.
With that in mind, we utilized AutoPhrase to extract the phrases from a database of 3,079,007
computer science research papers aggregated from 1950 to 2017. With this, we can trace the
evolution of key ideas through the history of computer science, as well as find which ideas were most
common in what years and how they connect with each other. Additionally, we used the extracted
phrases as data to construct a classification model for finding what year a paper belongs to based on
its key phrases as a way of showing how strong the connections are between ideas and time.
2 Methods
2.1 Data gathering and processing for DBLP v10 dataset
Our initial goal was to gather data on Computer Science papers over time, looking at titles, abstracts,
and paper contents. However, we realized that gathering and working with full paper text would result
in much larger and messier data, while likely not benefiting the results of AutoPhrase and our model.
As a result, we chose to focus on the DBLP Computer Science Bibliography dataset. We chose this
dataset as it contains a large amount of papers (3 million+) with information on each paper’s title,
abstract, and publication year. These attributes are all that is needed for the purposes of our analysis.
There are 13 versions of the dataset, but ultimately we chose to focus on the v10 dataset.
Our initial data processing was done on both the DBLP v10 and v13 datasets. The v13 dataset is the
latest version of the DBLP dataset from AMiner, released in May of 2021 with over 5 million papers.
It contains all of the information previously specified, but it also includes keywords for each paper.
We thought this would be beneficial as it allows for a point of comparison against the phrases we
35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021).would extract in the future by utilizing AutoPhrase. However, the v13 dataset had many issues with
formatting that caused issues when trying to process it. The entire dataset is contained in a .json file
that is too large to store in memory, so we had to process it line-by-line. However, the information
for each paper is not contained on a single line–rather, it is spread out across multiple lines. This
results in issues while processing each paper, as there are formatting issues that need to be resolved
with many different cases.
The DBLP v10 dataset has fewer papers compared to v13 as it was released in 2017, but it still has
information on 3 million+ papers. Additionally, it is much easier to work with as the information
for each paper is stored in a single line. We created a function that processes the dataset and outputs
the relevant information into .txt files in preparation for phrase mining. As we want to examine how
phrases change over time, papers are grouped together based on their publication year. Ultimately, we
decided to group years together in groups of 5, as we believe a single year may not be a significant
marker of change in the Computer Science field overall. By using intervals of 5, we can obtain a
clearer picture of the general trend of phrases and the change over a longer period of time.
All years are grouped in groups of 5 years, except for the last years in the dataset (2015-2017) and
the beginning years of the dataset (1950-1959). We decided to group the earlier years together in a
larger group as there are not as many papers in the earlier years.
When processing the papers, we realized that there were quite a few papers with empty abstracts or
invalid years. We chose to exclude any papers with empty abstracts and invalid years from the output
.txt files. We specified invalid years as anything prior to 1950 and anything after 2017. In total, there
were 530,394 papers with empty abstracts, and 82 papers with invalid years.
2.2 Exploratory data analysis for DBLP v10
Figure 1: Document count for DBLP v10
Figure 1 only includes information on papers that were included in the output files for phrase mining.
So the papers with empty abstracts or invalid years were not included. DBLP v10 contains 3,079,007
papers, but from our data processing steps, we filtered out 530,394 of the papers for having empty
abstracts, and 82 of the papers for having irrelevant years (anything before 1950). Thus, this graph
shows the distribution of the remaining 2,548,531 papers.
The number of papers has increased exponentially in recent years as the Computer Science field has
grown, both in popularity and complexity. There are many more sub-fields to explore and develop.
Overall the distribution has been strictly increasing over time, with the exception of a small dip in
2014, and the right-most bar in the graph representing 2017. It is smaller than would be expected as
the DBLP v10 dataset was published before the year was over, meaning it does not actually contain
all of the papers published in that year.
22.3 Running AutoPhrase: Phrase mining and Phrasal segmentation
AutoPhrase has two functions that can be run. The first, phrase mining, is the process described in the
Introduction. AutoPhrase only requires a single .txt file and it will output another .txt file containing
the extracted phrases and their associated phrase qualities. Phrase quality ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, with
1.0 being the highest quality. Alongside the outputted phrases, AutoPhrase also outputs other files,
one being the Segmentation Model. This model file can be used for AutoPhrase’s second function,
phrasal segmentation. Using the model file, it will modify an input .txt file by marking identified
phrases with phrase markers. This allows for further analysis as we can see the extracted phrases in
each paper in the dataset, which allows us to count the frequency of phrases.
As mentioned previously, we created a function to process the DBLP v10 dataset. It aggregates the
titles and abstracts of papers together in .txt files by the specified year ranges (intervals of 5 years).
However, when running the phrase mining step of AutoPhrase, it does require sufficient training data,
meaning that if the input .txt file is too small, the results will be mostly incoherent. We found that the
minimum file size is around 200-300 kilobytes, but it is not always consistent, as some smaller files
were able to run without errors. Regardless, it is better to have larger files. This is partially why we
decided to group years together when looking at the dataset over time, as many of the earlier years
did not have sufficient text data for the phrase mining step, as we can see from the distribution in
Figure 1. Ultimately, grouping the years in intervals of 5 prevents this issue with the phrase mining
step, and also allows for us to see more significant changes between each group.

When running AutoPhrase on a single year range’s .txt (containing all of its papers’ titles + abstracts),
we get an output of the phrases, along with their associated phrase qualities. Phrase quality ranges
from 0.0-1.0, where 1.0 is the highest quality. We can typically associate high-quality phrases
with single-word phrases with a score above 0.8 and multi-word phrases with a score above 0.5.
These phrases provide insight into the various topics covered in just a single year range of published
Computer Science papers.
This phrase mining step was run on each year range in the DBLP v10 dataset. The reason that we
separated the year ranges into their own .txt files was that the extracted phrases do not have a year or
year range associated with them. If we were to run the phrase mining step on the entire DBLP dataset,
it would require processing the entire input dataset of titles and abstracts, and phrase matching with
the phrase mining results to see which phrase belongs to which year range. Separating the papers by
year range allows us to know which phrase and phrase quality is associated with a specific year range.
3Figure 2: Average phrase length in each year range
After processing the phrase mining results, we calculated the average phrase length across each year
range. The phrase length referring to the number of words in a phrase. The average phrase length is
roughly two words long for each year range, with the exception of the earliest year range, 1950-1959.
Figure 3: Distribution of phrase lengths across the entire DBLP dataset
This histogram shows the distribution of phrase length across the entire DBLP dataset. We can see
that two-word phrases, or bi-grams, are the most common.
3.2 Phrasal segmentation results
After running the phrase mining step on each of the year ranges, the phrasal segmentation step was
also run, using each year range’s associated segmentation model from the phrase mining output.
Figure 4: Example phrasal segmentation results
The figure above shows an example of what phrasal segmentation does to text data. Any mined
phrases with be marked with phrase markers. The phrase markers and phrases are highlighted in this
screenshot for clarity. By processing the phrasal segmentation results, we can extract the marked
phrases and group them together. This allows us to see the phrases mined by AutoPhrase on a
per-paper level. For instance, with the example in the figure, if we consider it the text for a single
4paper, we can see that it contains the phrases: modular exponentiation, cornerstone, public-key
cryptography, and RSA.
Figure 5: Bar chart of average phrases identified over time
This chart shows the average number of phrases identified by AutoPhrase for each year range. From
processing the phrasal segmentation results, we are able to identify the phrases contained in each
paper in the dataset. We can then calculate the average number of phrases identified across all papers
in each year range, and then graph that information.
Here, we can see that the average number of phrases identified per paper generally increases over
time. This can be due to factors such as average length of input papers for that year range, but could
also be dependent upon the range of phrases displayed within a year range. A year range with more
phrase variety could have less phrases show up per paper due to the lower average scores of the
phrases causing them to be excluded from our high-quality phrase list.
Figure 6: Histogram of number of phrases identified across entire dataset
This histogram shows the distribution of the number of phrases identified across the entire DBLP
dataset. Overall, the number of phrases in a paper can vary widely, but the vast majority lie between
15 and 50 phrases.

We looked at the top 10 quality phrases across each year range to see how the phrase mining results
differ across years. Taking a glance at these example phrases will help us determine if the quality
phrases would serve as good predictors of a year. What is immediately obvious is that the first
category consisting of papers with years from 1950-1959 consists of much simpler phrases. This
category has the most single word phrases in their top 10 and their phrases illustrate broad concepts
in Computer Science. This is promising as early Computer Science papers would deal with more
basic concepts and could be a good predictor of year. This trend is relatively followed as the earlier
year ranges contain phrases essential to the basics of Computer Science such as ’data processing’ and
’information retrieval,’ while papers in later years contain more high-level concepts such as ’vector
quantization’ and more proper nouns like ’Rician fading’.
There are some other aspects that stand out when looking at table 8. The phrase ’dynamic program-
ming’ appears in the top 10 of many year groups along with other phrases like information retrieval
and feature extraction. The fact that AutoPhrase picks many high quality phrases that are not useful
for discriminating year groups could lead to AutoPhrase’s quality phrases being noisy data when
trying to use for prediction. Another interesting factor is that the year category 2005-2009 contains a
variety of phrases relating to biology such as ’cellular automata,’ ’life sciences,’ and ’blood pressure’.
This could possibly be due to Computer Science as a field expanding into other disciplines once the
foundations had been established. This could explain the appearance of many seemingly random
phrases within later years that appear to have very little to do directly with Computer Science.

6By processing the phrasal segmentation results, we can obtain the frequency of each phrase in each
year range’s text. We specifically focused on the most frequent multi-word phrases across each year
range in order to identify the most popular Computer Science topics in each period. We can see how
the frequency of the top 5 phrases increases greatly over time, as more papers are published and
topics of papers overlap. In the early years, there is a large focus on ’pattern recognition,’ as it is
in the top 5 in all of the year ranges from 1960-1984. Over time, this changes, with topics such as
’neural networks’ and ’machine learning’ becoming more prominent. Ultimately, this table provides
insight into the most frequent phrases across each year range, and it does reflect the changes in the
field as it has matured.
3.5 Phrase network visualization
Figure 7: Network visualization
Higher-quality, zoomable image can be found here. This graph was created using the Gephi applica-
tion after processing AutoPhrase’s phrasal segmentation results on the DBLP v10 dataset.
This network visualizes the relationship between phrases for all papers in the DBLP v10 dataset
(across all years). Phrases with more more occurrences in the dataset are represented by larger
nodes in the network. Nodes are connected based on their connections in the paper. The phrasal
segmentation results allowed us to extract the phrases identified for each individual paper in the
dataset. With this, we could calculate the number of connections each phrase had with each other.
For example, if ’neural network’ and ’machine learning’ are in the same paper, we would count that
as 1 connection. With more connections across papers, edges between nodes have a larger weight.
Node colors are determined by modularity, so nodes with stronger edges to each other will be grouped
together. For instance, with the purple nodes, ’machine learning’ is the largest node, and we see other
related nodes to that topic, such as ’decision trees’, ’support vector machines’, etc.
We only included multi-word phrases in the network, with a minimum threshold of 150 for the edge
weights. This means that only phrases with at least 150 connections to each other are included in
the network. This threshold is necessary as there are so many phrases and connections within the
entire DBLP dataset. It allows us to visualize the relationships between the most frequent and most
commonly occurring phrases.
73.6 Phrase network by year range
Figure 8: Yearly network visualization
Higher-quality, zoomable image can be found here.
This network isolates phrase relationships to their year range, providing insight into the most popular
and connected phrases in each year range. The nodes colors are based solely on the year range of the
phrase, rather than modularity. One fact to take into account is that the number of papers is much
higher is recent years, so the frequency of phrases and their connections is much higher compared to
earlier years. Steps were taken to normalize this difference across each year range and to only display
the strongest and most meaningful relationships, but the number of nodes for each year range is not
exactly equal. Ultimately, the purpose of this network is to provide a more intuitive understanding of
phrase connections in relation to time.
3.7 Classification model
One of our initial goals for this project was to create a classifier to predict the year of a random
Computer Science paper in order to demonstrate how distinct phrases contained within certain years
have the capability to identify what year of the input paper. For this, we attempted multiple types
of models including a Jaccard-based predictor, a predictor using phrase overlap between years, as
well as trained models using one-hot encoding. We were able to successfully create a model using a
combination of the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) text-vectorization and
grouping of multiple years. We were able to achieve a 0.79 f1 score on the test set.
Figure 1 (Document count for DBLP v10) shows the imbalance of paper count per year. It is not
feasible to predict a random paper up to the accuracy of a year. To mitigate the imbalance of the
paper count distribution, we grouped the papers into several-year brackets as shown in Table 9. The
""integer encoding"" simplified the coding.
For each paper, we used the high-quality phrases extracted by AutoPhrase from the abstract and title
of the paper. We filtered out some high scoring irrelevant phrases such as, ""paper argues"", ""paper
considers"", and etc. This was done by generating our own stop-word list of the irrelevant phrases
by reviewing the extracted high-quality phrases. Afterwards, we converted the high quality phrases
using TF-IDF text-vectorization changing the phrases into a fixed-length feature vector. We decided
to consider the top 1000000 phrases ordered by term frequency across all of the papers when building
the vocabulary. Our first baseline classifier utilized One-vs-the-rest (OvR) multi-class strategy to
classify a paper into the year brackets. Due to the imbalance of paper count distribution, we used
StratifiedShuffleSplit to perform a train-test split following the distribution of ""year-bracket"" so that
the train dataset and test dataset preserve the same distribution. Our baseline classifier resulted
in a 0.77 f1 score. By comparing the classification performance of different classifiers such as

Table 4: Year bracket partition, integer encoding, and paper count distribution
LogisticRegression and svm.LinearSVC, we found that svm.LinearSVC had the best performance.
We then used GridSearchCV method to search for the best C hyper-parameter of svm.LinearSVC.
Figure 9: Normalized Confusion Matrix
This confusion matrix was obtained by analyzing our final model utilizing svm.LinearSVC. The
normalized confusion matrix shows our model tends to predict the year later than the actual year. The
imbalance of the paper count (the later year has much more papers) is causing the issue. We need to
further mitigate the imbalance of the paper-per-year count.
We did not use the position info of the phrases when we performed the TF-IDF text-vectorization.
The ""ngram_range"" parameter of TfidfVectorizer can be used to catch the position info of the multiple
phrases.
4 Conclusion
After processing and exploring the DBLP v10 dataset, we were able to utilize both functions of
AutoPhrase (phrase mining and phrasal segmentation) to extract meaningful data and explore the
relationships between phrases further. We identified the change in phrases over time by looking at
the most popular phrases for each year range. We analyzed the relationship between phrases on a
per-paper level, utilizing the segmentation results, in order to create a network visualization. We
9analyzed this relationship with respect to time, visualizing the network of phrases for each year range.
We created a classification model in order to predict the year range of a paper based on its phrases.
5 Future Work
Additional work can be done to improve the classification model idea. The proposed idea was to be
able to pass in any random input paper title and abstract and obtain a prediction of the specific year.
Perhaps by utilizing the phrasal segmentation results and additional features to train a model, it may
be possible to revert back to making predictions to specific years, rather than the defined year ranges.
It would be interesting to explore an evolving network animation that starts with the first year in the
dataset, showing all of the phrase relationships, then dynamically changes as we go through each
year. This may not be possible directly in Gephi’s software, but it could be done by creating separate
graphs and maintaining certain color schemes. Additionally, exploring single-word phrases alongside
the multi-word phrases could be interesting as well. It may require additional filtering of words to
remove any meaningless phrases.

The phrase mining results per year are aggregated into a single .csv file with a new column containing
the phrase’s year. It is possible for multiple instances of a phrase to appear in the file, as they will have
a different associated year and generally have a different phrase quality value. We can utilize Pandas
to read in this file and perform various operations. For example, when looking at the value counts of
the phrases, we can see popular phrases that show up many times, such as ’natural language,’ ’data
structures,’ and ’artificial intelligence.’ We can then check for direct matches of a phrase, such as
checking the rows that have the phrase ’image processing’. When doing so, the phrase first appears
in our dataset in 1981 and has appeared in every year since, all the way until 2017.
Although phrase matching allows for us to directly find a phrase and the years in which it appears, it
does not account for potential misspelling or non-direct matches. For example, if we tried to match
for ’convolutional neural networks’ but the dataset only contained ’convolutional neural network’
(not plural).
10We utilized the Levenshtein package to measure the Levenshtein distance between strings. This
allows for us to find phrases in the dataframe that may not be exact matches, but are similar enough
to warrant further analysis. When looking for the phrase ’convolutional neural networks’, there is
a direct match in the dataframe, but there are also other phrases that are extremely similar, such
as ’convolutional neural network’ and ’convolutional networks’. This approach looking at phrase
similarity allows for us to find the most similar phrases to the input phrase, without having to worry
about having a direct match in the dataframe. We believe this idea can be utilized to consolidate
phrases within the phrase mining results, as there are commonly multiple instances of extremely
similar phrases, such as ’neural network’ and ’neural networks.’
This could also be used as an alternative method to classify an input paper’s year, or to provide
information on the various phrases within an input paper and the years in which those phrases
originate. For example, if we take in a paper’s title and abstract, we can extract the phrases within it,
by using an n-gram model, or the phrasal segmentation function. Then we could use phrase similarity
to find the similar phrases. So, if a paper contained the phrase ’convolutional neural networks,’ we
could say that we found a match of that phrase, and that it first appeared in 2012, with continual
appearances until 2017.
11","The paper discusses the use of AutoPhrase, a tool for extracting quality phrases from large text corpora, in analyzing computer science papers over time. The authors aim to analyze how phrases change over time and how they are connected to each other. They also utilize the extracted phrases to build a classification model for predicting the year range of a paper based on its key phrases. The paper includes details on data gathering and processing, exploratory data analysis, phrase mining results, phrasal segmentation results, phrase network visualization, and the classification model. Future work includes improving the classification model and exploring evolving network animations."

ABSTRACT
Codenames
is
a
popular
board
game
that
relies
on
word
association
and
its
ultimate
goal
is
to
connect
multiple
words
together
with
a
single
clue
word.
In
this
paper ,
we
construct
a
system
that
incorporates
artificial
intelligence
into
the
game
to
allow
communication
between
humans
and
AI
as
well
as
providing
the
capability
of
replacing
human
effort
in
creating
such
a
clue
word.
Our
project
utilized
three
types
of
word
relationship
measurements
from
Word2V ec,
GloV e,
and
WordNet,
to
design
and
understand
word
relationships
used
in
this
game.
An
AI
system
is
built
on
each
measurement
and
tested
on
both
AI-AI
and
AI-Human
communication
performance.
We
evaluate
the
performance
with
each
system’ s
average
speed
in
finishing
a
game
as
well
as
its
ability
to
accurately
identify
their
team
words.
The
AI-AI
team
performance
demonstrates
outstanding
efficiency
for
AI
to
manage
this
game,
and
the
best
performing
measurement
is
able
to achieve a 60% accuracy in its communication between AI and Human.
1.
INTRODUCTION
For
a
long
time,
people
have
been
using
AIs
to
play
games.
From
Atari
games
to
Starcraft,
in
the
last
few
decades,
artificial
intelligence
has
been
making
its
way
into
the
games
humans
play
to
varying
levels
of
success.
Games
like
Othello
that
have
almost
entirely
been
solved
by
AI,
while
the ultimate strategy for games like chess and Go just became promising recently .
1.1 How to Play
In
this
project,
we
created
an
AI
for
the
popular
board
game
Codenames.
The
rules
for
this
board
game
are
simple.
There
are
two
teams,
each
with
a
spymaster
and
a
fixed
number
of
guesser(s).
On
the
board,
there
is
a
five-by-five
grid
of
words,
randomly
consisting
of
9
agents
for
team
A,
8
agents
for
team
B,
7
neutral
words,
and
1
assassin
word.
The
belonging
of
each
word
is
only
known
by
the
spymasters,
and
they
want
to
have
their
guesser(s)
identify
all
their
agent
words
before
the
other
team
does.
The
game
progresses
in
alternating
turns,
and
the
spymaster
is
allowed
to
give
a
clue
to
their
guessers
each
turn.
A
clue
consists
of
a
word
which
is
related
to
some
of
their
team’ s
agents
on
the
board,
followed
by
a
number ,
which
is
the
number
of
agents
to
which
the
preceding
word
is
related
to.
For
example,
a
hint
of
“cloud:
3”
is
a
hint
that
three
of
the
team’ s
agent
words
are
related
to
“cloud”
in
some
way.
The
guessing
team
is
allowed
to
guess
the
number
of
related
words
plus
one
additional
word
each
turn.
Guesses
are
made
one
at
atime,
and
if
the
guessed
word
is
correct,
the
next
word
can
be
guessed.
Each
guess
eliminates
that
word
from
the
game
board.
If
the
field
agents
guess
a
neutral
word
or
an
opposing
team’ s
agents,
those
words
are
eliminated
and
the
turn
ends.
If
a
team
guesses
the
assassin
word,
the
game immediately ends, and the opposing team wins automatically .
Codenames
is
a
game
that
requires
knowledge
of
how
certain
words
are
related
to
each
other .
For
a
human,
such
knowledge
can
be
different
depending
on
person
to
person.
However ,
this
task
can
also
be
executed
using
a
computer .
In
this
report,
we
investigate
some
methods
that
can
be
used
to simulate playing Codenames.

RELATED WORK
Our
project
utilizes
learned
word
relationships
to
simulate
the
mindset
of
humans
while
playing
the
board
game
Codenames.
In
this
section,
we
will
discuss
relevant
word
relationships
and
several existing Codenames AI projects.
2.1 Word Relationship
The
entire
game
functions
about
word
relationships,
as
the
spymaster
is
trying
to
find
a
word
that
has
potential
connections
to
as
many
words
as
possible,
and
the
guessers
are
trying
to
decode
this
thought
process.
Several
standardized
embeddings
have
been
designed
to
emphasize
inter-word
relationships.
[1][2]
proposes
a
vector
space
word
embedding
(Word2V ec)
that
maps
each
word
to
a
high-dimensional
vector .
A
neural
network
is
trained
on
the
input
word
corpus
so
that
the
vectors
of
semantically
similar
words
will
have
higher
cosine
similarities.
Notably ,
special
relationships,
such
as
super -subordinate
and
part-whole
relations,
are
maintained
in
the
embedding
as
a
constant
vector
difference
between
two
words.
For
example,
the
vector
difference
between
Japan-T okyo and US-W ashington is similar in the Word2V ec embedding.
Noticing
the
importance
of
co-occurrence
frequency
in
determining
the
word
similarity ,
[3]
proposes
a
different
cosine-similarity-based
pipeline,
GloV e,
that
emphasizes
this
observation.
In
this
project,
we
will
include
the
word
relationship
trained
from
GloV e
to
compare
these
two
cosine similarity methods.
Another
popular
word
relation
corpus
is
WordNet
[4].
Unlike
the
cosine
similarity
methods,
WordNet
looks
into
the
hierarchical
closeness
of
two
different
words
in
terms
of
belonging
relationships.
For
example,
“ant”
and
“spider”
(both
insects)
will
have
a
higher
similarity
thanthat
of
“ant”
and
“lion”.
For
this
project,
we
incorporated
the
Wu-Palmer
similarity
computed
from the WordNet corpus.
2.2 Codenames AI
Several
Codenames
AI
projects
have
existed
before
our
version,
and
they
provide
us
with
strategic
guidance
as
well
as
some
baselines
to
outperform.
For
data
acquiring,
[5]
utilized
word
corpus
from
Wikipedia
to
extract
the
most
frequent
words.
For
words
about
general
topics,
Wikipedia
provides
abundant
links
among
words
so
that
the
most
frequent
words
can
be
highly
associative
to
the
words
provided
in
Codenames.
However ,
we
discovered
a
preprocessed
Wikipedia
word
list
[6]
that
already
does
this
job
for
us.
We
will
simply
start
from
there
to
extract
the
most
frequent
words
as
we
need.
The
author
of
[7]
suggested
the
potential
influence
of
vocabulary
size
to
the
performance
of
Codenames
AI,
which
encourages
us
to
perform
a
dictionary
size
test
to
validate
this
idea
while
finding
the
optimal
vocabulary
size
for
our
AI.
On
the
algorithm
side,
[8]
proposed
a
lower
bound
for
similarity
score
to
be
considered
for
human
beings.
Multiple
AIs
who
share
the
same
knowledge
base
can
understand
the
difference
between
a
cosine
similarity
of
0.1
and
that
of
0.09.
However ,
word
relations
with
such
low
similarities
become
meaningless
to
humans.
Therefore,
the
author
of
[8]
performed
experiments
and
discovered
that
0.45
will
be
a
good
threshold
to
cut
off
the
cosine
similarity ,
so
that
an
AI
spymaster
will
ignore
all
weak
relationships
when
teamed
up
with
a
human.
This
information
turns
out
to
be
useful
when
we
implement
the
Human-AI
mode,
and
we
are
expecting
different
thresholds for dif ferent similarity metrics.

METHODOLOGY
3.1 Data
In
building
the
Codenames
AI
system,
we
utilized
the
Simple
Wiki
dataset
to
obtain
word
relationship
measurements
and
vocabularies
for
the
AI
knowledge
base.
The
Simple
Wiki
dataset
contains
articles
from
the
English
Simple
Wikipedia.
The
data
is
downloaded
from
the
wiki
dump
and
is
more
general
in
its
choice
of
topics.
The
innate
property
of
such
an
encyclopedia
is
that
it
can
provide
abundant
information
about
word
relationships
covering
a
wide
range
of
daily
topics.
In
order
to
populate
our
dictionary
bases,
we
first
gathered
all
400
words
used
in
Codenames
from
boardgamegeek.com.
Then
for
the
AI
vocabulary
base,
we
utilized
existing
projects
that
provided
the
statistics
of
the
most
common
English
words.
The
first
project
contains
the
top
1000
most
frequently
appearing
words,
the
results
came
from
a
n-gram
frequency
analysis
on
Google’ sTrillion
Word
Corpus.
The
second
dataset
presented
a
similar
but
longer
list
of
most
common
words
that
appeared
in
the
English
Wikipedia
articles.
With
the
larger
file
and
ranking
of
word
frequencies,
we
can
expand
the
dictionary
size
to
see
its
impact
on
the
system
performance.
We
propose
vocabulary
sizes
of
3k,
5k,
10k,
20k,
and
30k
to
test
the
idea
in
[7].
Details
of
this
test
are presented in
Section 5.1
.
To
process
the
Simple
Wiki
corpora
for
training,
we
converted
all
letters
to
lowercase,
removed
punctuation,
and
tokenized
the
words.
The
final
format
of
the
corpus
is
a
2D
list
that
contains
the
word
tokens
for
each
individual
article.
For
training,
we
utilized
the
Word2V ec
model
from
the
gensim
package
to
train
the
first
vector
embedding
for
each
word
in
Codenames
and
our
AI
vocabulary
bases.
This
model
takes
in
a
correctly
formatted
text
corpus
and
outputs
a
vector
in
a
300
dimensional
space
for
each
word.
The
vector
embeddings
for
the
words
used
in
the
both
vocabulary
bases
are
then
extracted
to
compute
the
similarities.
We
obtain
the
pretrained
Global
Vectors,
GloV e,
from
the
Standard
project
and
extract
all
words
in
Codenames
and
the
AI
vocabulary
base.
The
Wu-Palmer
similarity
is
directly
measured
between
two
words
by
the
module
in
WordNet,
so
we
simply
iterate
through
the
matrix
and
insert
the
similarity
score
returned by the function.
3.2 Algorithms
Algorithm for  Spymaster
Our
Codenames
AI
optimizes
each
step
of
its
action
based
on
the
current
board
information
B,
the
vocabulary
base
W
it
has,
and
its
knowledge
about
word
similarities
in
terms
of
a
matrix
M
.
When
playing
as
a
spymaster ,
it
will
go
through
all
of
its
vocabulary
and
try
to
optimize
the
clue
through
the
following
criteria:
1)
Connect
to
the
greatest
number
of
ally
words
on
the
current
board; 2) Is away from other words in terms of similarities as much as possible.
Algorithm 1:
Naive Codenames Clue Nomination
Input:
Available words on board

A
, vocabulary base

.
Output:

//

//

proposed
as
the

The
value
of
s
is
dominated𝑠←𝑐+𝑚−𝑙
by
c
.
if
then𝑠>𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑤*←𝑤,𝑐*←𝑐, 𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑥←𝑠
return
w*
, c*
To
achieve
this,
we
design
an
algorithm
(Algorithm
1)
that
computes
a
score
S(w;
B,
W,
M)
for
each
vocabulary
word
w
,
and
finally
pick
the
word
with
the
highest
score
as
the
clue
proposed.
For each
w
, we first extract its similarity with all
the existing words on the board. We compute a
lower
bound
l
w
as
the
maximum
of
the
similarities
among
all
non-ally
words
(i.e.
opponents’
words
+
neutral
words
+
assassin
word).
Then,
we
can
have
a
set
S
w
composed
of
all
ally
words
that
have
higher
similarities
than
l
w
.
Assuming
our
guesser
shares
the
exact
same
knowledge
for
the
similarities
with
the
spymaster ,
it
is
guaranteed
that
the
guesser
will
guess
all
words
in
S
w 
before
touching
any
of
the
non-ally
words
if
provided
with
the
clue
w
.
Having
this
in
mind,
the
word
w*
will
be
the
optimal
clue
if
the
size
of
S
w*
is
the
largest.
To
break
ties,
we
implemented
a
safety weight that slightly prefers the word with a lar ger gap between
l
w
and similarities for
S
w
.
The
naive
version
of
the
clue
nomination
algorithm
is
strengthened
in
the
following
ways:
1)
When
computing
the
maximum
similarity
of
non-ally
words
for
the
lower
bound
l
w
,
we
assign
fixed
weights
(>
1)
to
words
that
we
do
not
want
the
guesser
AI
to
touch.
Explicitly ,
the
assassin
word
will
get
the
biggest
weight
because
touching
it
will
make
the
team
lose
automatically;
the
enemy’ s
words
have
a
higher
weight
than
the
neutral
words
for
a
similar
reason.
2)
When
playing
with
a
human
teammate,
the
lower
bound
will
become
where
θ
is
the
threshold𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑙,θ)
for
the
connection
to
be
human-interpretable,
inspired
by
the
observation
in
[7].
Qualitative
and
quantitative
methods
are
mixed
to
give
suggestions
to
the
threshold
θ
for
each
system,
and
details will be explained in
Section 5.2
.
Algorithm for  Guesser
After
receiving
the
clue
word
w
and
the
number
of
words
related
to
the
clue
c
,
the
guesser
will
make
a
sequence
of
guesses
based
on
the
same
idea.
It
ranks
all
words
on
the
board
based
on
their
similarity
with
w
,
and
makes
a
guess
on
the
word
with
the
highest
rank.
If
it
succeeds,
it
proceeds
to
the
second,
and
the
third,
…
The
procedure
ends
until
a
non-ally
word
is
touched,
or
the guess count reaches the limit.
However ,
one
should
notice
that,
assuming
both
the
spymaster
and
the
guesser
are
AI
players
who
share
the
same
knowledge
base,
there
will
be
no
chance
for
the
guesser
to
get
any
guesswrong,
because
the
top
k
associated
words
are
guaranteed
to
be
ally
words
by
Algorithm
1.
This
makes
the
game
played
by
pure
AI
teams
finish
super
fast,
as
observed
in
Section
4.1
.
To
simulate
the
fact
that
different
humans,
although
sharing
the
same
commonsense
of
the
world,
may
have
slightly
different
perceptions
towards
the
strength
of
word
similarities,
we
add
a
noise
matrix
to
the
similarity
matrix
of
the
guesser .
Such
a
matrix
modifies
the
value
of
each
similarity ,
with
each
point
of
the
noise
matrix
sampled
from
a
normal
distribution
with
a
small
standard
deviation.
By
increasing
this
standard
deviation,
we
are
able
to
simulate
two
teammates
with
more
different
mindsets
and
less
so-called
“tacit
understanding”.
Details
of
this
experiment
can
be found in
Section 5.3
.
4.
EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
In
this
section,
we
test
for
the
performance
of
the
three
word
relationships
under
the
settings
of
an
AI-AI
team
and
an
AI-Human
team.
We
use
the
best
version
of
the
dataset
for
each
word
relationship
measurement
–
Word2V ec,
GloV e,
and
WordNet
–
after
some
preliminary
experiments
on
their
performances.
The
final
datasets
contain
around
23,000
words
for
the
AI
to
use
for
each
word
relationship.
More
details
on
how
to
come
to
the
final
dataset
are
mentioned
in
Section 5
.
The
performance
will
be
assessed
with
different
metrics
and
standards
to
reflect
different
expectations
of
the
relationships
under
these
two
team
settings.
Ultimately ,
we
want
to
find
the
top
performing
combinations
that
can
be
deployed
to
optimize
both
types
of
communications.
To
test
for
the
best
performance,
hyperparameters
have
already
been
tuned
beforehand
for
each
word relationship.
4.1 AI-AI Communication
For
AI-AI
communication,
we
primarily
test
on
the
accuracy
of
guessing
and
average
number
of
turns
for
the
AI
to
finish
the
games.
The
statistics
are
obtained
by
simulating
100
random
games
per
word
relationship,
with
AI
taking
all
4
roles:
2
spymasters
and
2
guessers.
To
avoid
confounding
factors,
we
controlled
the
experiments
by
using
the
same
set
of
random
seeds
for
each set of word relationships.(a)
(b)

Three
datasets
are
each
tested
with
100
simulations
in
the
average
number
of
turns
taken
to
finish
a
game
and
its
ability
to
accurately
choose
the
intended
words
from
the
spymaster.
GloVe
and
word2vec
datasets
perform
better than that of the wup dataset.
As
observed
in
figure
1a,
the
GloV e
and
Word2V ec
dataset
performed
equally
well,
which
is
better
than
the
WordNet
dataset.
Our
hypothesis
of
high
values
in
game
accuracy
from
AI-AI
communication
is
also
tested
with
the
final
datasets.
Figure
1b
visualized
both
the
true
and
total
accuracy
for
each
dataset
and
we
can
see
a
nearly
perfect
performance
for
AI
guessers
to
correctly
choose
the
intended
words
from
the
spymaster .
This
demonstrates
the
effectiveness
of
the
AI
algorithm
in
communicating
ideas
when
they
share
the
same
knowledge
base.
Although
not
the
main
focus,
we
also
observed
a
slightly
better
performance
in
the
GloV e
and
Word2V ec
datasets.
4.2 AI-Human Communication
For
this
section
of
the
experiment,
we
use
the
same
experimental
set
up
as
AI-AI
testing,
with
the
exception
of
substituting
the
AI
guesser
with
a
human
player
and
testing
with
a
smaller
group
of
datasets.
Similar
to
above,
we
will
take
into
consideration
the
average
number
of
turns
taken
to
finish
the
game.
Now
that
the
players
are
using
different
knowledge
bases,
we
will
also
examine
their
interactions
in
terms
of
how
accurately
the
human
guesser
can
uncover
the
AI
intended words.
For
each
of
the
simulations,
we
record
the
same
data
as
the
above
experiment
with
additional
statistics
regarding
the
accuracy
per
game.
Every
round,
the
AI
spymaster
will
generate
a
clue
word
and
have
a
set
of
target
words
that
it
intends
to
connect
with.
We
record
these
intended
words
along
with
the
guesses
made
by
the
human
guesser
to
calculate
the
accuracies
for
each
game.
We
measure
2
types
of
accuracies
in
this
section.
The
first
one,
true
(intended)
accuracy ,
being
the
number
of
team
words
that
are
correctly
guessed
as
intended
by
the
AI.
The
second
one,
total
accuracy ,
is
calculated
as
the
number
of
team
words
that
are
correctly
guessed
and
these do not have to be in the set of words intended by the AI spymaster .
We
carry
out
the
same
experiments
as
above
and
replace
the
role
of
AI
guessers
with
humans
for
both
teams.
With
the
introduction
of
human
efforts,
the
average
turns
taken
for
a
game
to
finish
has
increased
in
5
out
of
the
6
experiment
settings
(figure
2a).
This
behavior
is
expected,
however ,
as
there
exists
a
gap
between
human
and
AI
communication.
Similar
to
AI-AI
communication,
the
GloV e
and
Word2V ec
datasets
had
better
performances.
We
then
compare
each
datasets’
impact
on
triggering
the
assassin
word,
which
would
cause
an
immediate
termination
of
the
game.
Figure
2b
presents
the
GloV e
dataset
as
having
the
most
number
of
complete
games
in
a
simulation
with
100
games.
Finally
we
analyze
the
accuracies
of
each
dataset in figure 2c. GloV e again stood out with the highest accuracies amongst the 3 datasets.
It
is
interesting
to
see
that
even
though
the
Word2V ec
dataset
finished
the
games
faster ,
its
accuracy
in
performance
was
the
worst.
This
might
be
caused
by
the
fact
that
the
AI
using
Word2V ec
embeddings
like
to
propose
clues
with
higher
number
of
word
connections
while
sacrificing
the
meaningfulness
of
the
hint.
As
both
high
accuracy
and
less
turns
are
needed
to
succeed
in
the
game,
the
tradeof fs
between
the
two
will
need
to
be
balanced
by
the
players
based
on
the
preferred
goal.
In
this
section
we
conclude
that
the
GloV e
dataset
is
most
compatible
with
human
players
given
its
high
accuracy
and
low
game
termination.
As
discussed
in
Section
2
,
this
conclusion
might
suggest
that
human
beings
prefer
to
see
two
words
relating
to
each
other
through
the
con-occurence
of
the
words,
rather
than
their
categorical
belonging
(WordNet)
or
semantic identity (W ord2V ec).

The
GloVe dataset performed best when human players are introduced to the game.
5.
SIDE EXPERIMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS
5.1 Vocabulary Size
With
larger
vocabulary
size,
one
can
imagine
having
more
options
to
choose
from
when
proposing
the
clue
while
playing
the
game.
However ,
recording
the
relationship
between
codenames
words
and
more
vocabularies
will
result
in
a
larger
file
of
storage.
Having
this
trade-of f
in
mind,
we
are
curious
about
the
actual
impact
of
the
increase
in
vocabulary
size
as
to
the
performance
of
the
AI.
Therefore,
we
prepared
copies
of
the
dataset
with
different
vocabulary
sizes
varying
from
3k,
5k,
10k,
to
20k.
We
did
a
round
of
testing
with
100
games
for
each dataset, and visualized the results in Figure 3 below .
Figure 3. Impact of vocabulary size on the performance of AI-AI gameplay.
As
observed
above,
an
increase
in
vocabulary
size
will
significantly
improve
the
performance
of
the
model
when
the
size
is
less
than
10k.
The
model
keeps
improving
after
10k,
but
becomes
relatively
negligible.
Therefore,
if
there
is
a
need
for
portability ,
an
optimal
vocabulary
size
should
be
around
10k.
However ,
as
we
are
testing
for
the
best
potential
of
the
AI
model,
we
use
the maximum size of vocabulary for the final testing in
Section 4
.
5.2 Human Interpr etable Threshold
As
discussed
in
[8],
although
the
AI-AI
team
can
take
advantage
of
the
full
similarity
matrix
when
proposing
clues,
a
word
relationship
with
a
relatively
low
similarity
score
is
meaningless
to
a
human
being.
As
a
result,
when
the
AI
spymaster
is
teaming
up
with
a
human,
proposing
clues
with
a
high
number
of
connections
but
low
similarity
scores
will
have
much
stronger
negative
side
effects
than
benefits.
Thus,
for
the
betterment
of
the
AI-Human
team
performance,
it
is
effective
to
remove
all
the
word
relationships
that
have
a
similarity
score
lower
than
a
certain
threshold.
In
practice,
we
set
the
similarity
value
of
these
cases
to
zero
so
that
the
AI
won’ t see any connection between the pair of words.
The
straightforward
way
to
determine
the
threshold
is
to
manually
evaluate
the
percentage
of
meaningful
connections
among
all
pairs
of
words.
To
do
this,
we
randomly
sampled
10
words
from
the
codenames
word
list,
and
sorted
all
the
vocabulary
words
by
their
similarity
score
with
the
codenames
word.
Some
examples
of
this
process
can
be
found
in
Appendix
B.
By
observation,
the
top
30
words
have
super
strong
connections
that
a
human
can
identify
with
no
effort.
However ,
having
only
30
connections
per
word
makes
the
final
matrix
very
sparse,
hence
producing
no
clues
with
connections
higher
than
one.
We
lower
the
expectation
and
conclude
that
the
top
80-120
words
contain
some
meaningful
connection
to
the
target
word.
This
is
our
secondary threshold that is acceptable but not satisfying.
In
the
end,
we
chose
the
threshold
to
be
the
96.5th
percentile
of
the
entire
matrix,
which
is
on
average
80
words
per
target
word.
We
did
another
round
of
100
game
simulation
of
AI-AI
testing
on
this
sparse
version
of
the
dataset,
where
the
human
threshold
restriction
is
enforced.
The
result
is
shown
in
Figure
4.
The
average
number
of
turns
is
roughly
the
same
with
the
AI-Human
testing
results,
which
indicates
that
our
threshold
restriction
pushes
the
performance
of
AI
closer
to that of a Human.

5.3 Level of Human-AI Misinformation
A
significant
advantage
of
the
AI-AI
team
is
that
both
the
spymaster
and
the
guesser
use
the
same
word
relationship
matrix
to
make
decisions.
Hence,
their
knowledge
base
is
completely
the
same.
On
the
other
hand,
this
is
the
main
reason
that
this
board
game
is
entertaining
for
humans
but trivial for AI.
To
simulate
the
gameplay
of
a
Human,
i.e.
different
individuals
have
different
knowledge
base
for
the
word
relationship,
we
add
a
confusion
matrix
as
noise
to
the
matrix
of
the
guesser .
Each
element
of
the
confusion
matrix
is
sampled
from
an
i.i.d.
Gaussian
distribution
with
mean
0
and
standard
deviation
σ.
The
higher
the
value
of
σ
is,
the
more
different
the
knowledge
bases
of
AI
spymaster
and
AI
guesser
will
be.
We
would
expect
an
increase
in
the
average
number
of
turns
and
a
decrease
in
the
accuracy
as
σ
increases.
To
see
how
much
of
a
standard
deviation
can
make
an
AI
perform
similar
to
a
Human
in
terms
of
these
statistics,
we
did
a
set
of
experiments
with
different sets of thresholds.
Figure
5
shows
the
result
of
this
confusion
matrix
experiment.
As
different
word
relationship
embeddings
have
different
standard
deviation
σ
m
within
the
original
matrix,
for
fairness,
we
represent
the
standard
deviation
of
the
confusion
matrix
σ
c
as
a
rescale
of
σ
m
.
That
is,
the
x-axis
in Figure 5 represents the value of 
σ
c
/σ
m
.
Figure 5. Accuracy of AI-AI communication with confusion matrix imposed.
The
intersection
between
the
accuracy
curve
and
the
constant
line
representing
the
human
testing
result
quantifies
the
level
of
misinformation
between
human
and
AI.
The
level
is
around
0.5
data
standard
deviation
for
the
GloV e
and
Word2V ec
model,
while
around
1.5
for
the
WordNet
dataset.
This
observation
agrees
with
the
AI-Human
testing
results
in
Section
4.2
,
as
human
cannot
understand
the
relationship
implied
in
wup
compared
to
the
other
two.
For
the
purpose
of
developing
a
fair
game
AI,
we
may
want
to
set
the
confusion
matrix
of
AI
so
that
their
performances match the AI-Human performance (i.e. at 0.5 and 1.5 respectively).

CONCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS
6.1 Limitations
While
the
result
of
this
project
was
a
functional
AI
that
could
understand
and
simulate
playing
a
game
of
Codenames
with
a
human
teammate,
we
observed
some
limitations
when
implementing
an
AI
with
this
method.
The
chief
concern
with
this
method
is
in
its
inflexibility .
In
our
current
implementation,
the
threshold
the
AI
uses
to
determine
what
its
human
partner
will
and
will
not
understand
is
a
definite
number .
From
our
observations,
this
will
work
for
most
cases
in
word
relationships,
but
even
in
our
testing
experience
it
will
still
occasionally
miss
the
mark.
Especially
in
early
phases
of
the
game,
all
implementations
of
our
AI
could
give
a
hint
which
wouldn’ t
be
related
to
any
words
on
the
board
from
a
human
perspective.
Moreover ,
as
the
game
continued,
the
AI
would
only
be
able
to
give
hints
for
one
or
two
words
at
a
time,
since
our
threshold
and
algorithm
judged
that
those
would
be
best
for
a
human
to
understand.
Realistically ,
a
human
team
would
be
able
to
guess
2-3
words
more
often
than
what
our
AI-human
teams
could
guess.
The
inflexible
nature
of
our
human-AI
relationship
implementation
means
that
there
will
still
be
a
weakness
in
that
certain
guesses
and
hints
are
beyond
the
scope
of
the
AI
to
understand and be able to give hints.
Another
limitation
we
encountered
was
in
dictionary
size.
As
stated
in
Section
5.1
,
we
observed
that
larger
dictionary
sizes
helped
the
AI
have
greater
accuracy
and
shorter
game
times
in
our
AI-AI
testing.
However ,
with
the
storage
sizes
required
for
keeping
vocabulary
bases
larger
than
30-40k
words,
it
quickly
became
unfeasible
for
this
project.
However ,
this
could
be
an
area
for
further
exploration.
Overall,
the
limitations
we
observed
in
this
AI
is
in
its
simplicity
and
naive
approach.
6.2 Conclusions
Ultimately ,
the
conclusion
of
this
project
reveals
a
few
ideas
that
come
to
mind
when
considering
AI
for
games
like
Codenames.
One
observation
we
made
is
in
the
weaknesses
of
methods
like
Word2V ec
and
GloV e
in
creating
word
relationships
that
can
be
discernible
to
the
human
eye.
The
methods
used
in
this
project
generate
maps
and
vectors
that
are
difficult
to
interpret
on
their
own,
and
require
metrics
and
measurements
in
order
to
make
sense
of
them.
This
presents
an
inflexibility
in
how
the
AI’s
knowledge
base
is
generated
when
compared
with
a
human’ s
knowledge
base.
The
way
all
methods
tested
here
calculate
word
relationships
is
fundamentally
different
from
a
human’ s
way
of
thinking,
and
the
number
of
hoops
to
jump
through
in
order
to
bring
those
two
thought
processes
together
is
a
daunting
task.
Our
implementation
still
has
that
weakness even after all our iterations.The
conclusion
we
must
ultimately
draw
from
this
project
is
that
vector
embeddings
and
word
maps,
while
good
at
determining
the
absolute
relationships
between
words,
are
too
narrow
of
a
scope
to
provide
a
solid
baseline
for
producing
an
AI
in
a
game
like
Codenames.
The
way
a
player
of
Codenames
can
relate
words
is
too
varied
and
abstract
for
a
purely
mathematical
method
like
we
used
here
to
be
the
base
for
an
AI’s
decision
making.
In
future
projects
pertaining
to
the
creation
of
automated
Codenames
players,
approaches
using
traditional
AI
techniques
used
in
modern
computer
games,
like
decision
trees,
can
more
effectively
simulate
the
human
decision
making
required
for
this
game.
Methods
like
Word2V ec,
GloV e
and
our
algorithm
can,
and
should,
be
used
as
part
of
that
process,
but
from
the
results
of
this
project,
we
must
conclude
that
using
our
method
alone
isn’t
enough
to
create
a
strong,
competent
AI
that
can
simulate a true to life game of Codenames.

Appendix A. Pr oject Pr oposal
Codenames
is
a
popular
word
association
game
that
involves
2
teams,
4
roles,
and
25
word
cards.
The
cards
are
laid
out
in
a
5x5
display
and
each
team
gets
randomly
assigned
8
or
9
words.
The
rest
of
the
cards
are
all
neutral
except
for
1
assassin
card.
The
teams
compete
by
designating
a
spymaster ,
who
knows
the
identity
of
all
the
cards,
to
give
a
one-word
clue
along
with
a
number
for
the
guessers,
the
rest
of
the
team,
to
identify
which
cards
belong
to
their
team.
The
two
teams
will
take
turns
until
either
one
team
correctly
guesses
all
their
words,
or
victory
is
declared to the opponents if one team revealed the assassin card.
We
are
interested
in
developing
an
AI
system
that
could
replace
the
roles
of
the
spymaster
and/or
guesser
for
the
game
Codenames.
This
will
allow
for
humans
to
team
up
or
compete
with
AI
and
we
hope
to
discover
interesting
behaviors
during
the
process.
As
the
game
involves
associations
between
different
words,
we
will
investigate
the
relationship
for
all
word
choices
provided
by
the
game.
Data
will
be
obtained
from
the
website
boardgamegeek.com
which
consists
of
the
400
words
used
for
the
game.
In
order
to
accomplish
this,
we
will
utilize
Word2V ec
models
and
transform
the
words
in
the
game
and
a
dictionary
consisting
of
the
most
common
10,000
English
words
into
vector
embeddings.
Then
we
can
produce
good
word
clues
by

103,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonathantanoto/artifact-directory-template/main/report.pdf,"Spam Detection Using Natural Language Processing   https://github.com/jonathantanoto/spam_detection_180B  By: Jonathan Tanoto HDSI Capstone Project  Abstract Spam messages in the United States costs approximately $20 billion annually, compared with approximately $200 million in surplus generated by the spam to users. Spamming is a big problem that is not an easy problem to solve manually. With the booming age of technology, spams are generated and sent at an unprecedented rate and this calls for a more innovative way of blocking out spam emails.  Luckily, we also happen to live in an age where Neural Networks and Natural Language Processing methods can be implemented to build a classification network to distinguish whether a given email is a spam or not.  Data Overview The data that will be utilized was taken from Enron. The dataset contains ~33k messages, approximately evenly split between spam and not spam. However, the data is not clean and needs a lot of pre-processing before any data manipulation can be done.  Data Cleaning The raw format of the dataset contains two folders filled with .txt files; one for spam messages and another for non-spam messages. Figure 1 shows a sample .txt file           The steps to clean each .txt files are as follows: 1. Extract first line and record as ‘subject’. 2. Everything else besides the first line will be part of the message. 3. Utilizing regular expression (REGEX), extract first date encountered based on format.  
Figure 1. Sample Raw Data .txt After applying these steps to all .txt files, a DataFrame will be generated by Pandas with the format shown on Figure 2. 
 Exploratory Data Analysis The dataset is relatively balanced with a discrepancy of around 1.8% of the total messages. Figure 3 shows a bar plot of the division between spam and non-spam messages. 
 It is shown that the dataset that will be used to train is a well-balanced one. Figure 4 shows the time frame of these messages. Most of the messages being sent are between 2000-2001 and 2004-2005. There seems to be a gap between 2002-2003, but this should not create any significant error. 
 
Figure 2. Cleaned DataFrame 
Figure 3. Bar Plot Count 
Figure 4. Timeframe of messages 
Figure 5. Word Cloud for genuine messages Figure 6. Word Cloud for spam messages Figure 5 and 6 shows word-clouds for genuine and spam messages, respectively. Notice that official and formal words are likely to be found on the genuine word-cloud, whereas words on the second word-cloud are typically found in spam messages.  Data Preprocessing Each row (message) from the DataFrame goes through a flow of data pre-processing before it is used to train models. The flow is depicted in Figure 7.                The raw data consists of the Message column of the DataFrame. The next step is to convert to lowercase and tokenize word-per-word. Unique words will then be put inside an index, denoted by an integer. Each message is then converted to an array of integers based on the word index. Lastly, the sequences are padded in the front so that all messages have the same length. Now, since the text is converted to a numerical representation, it can be quantified and used to train the models later on.   The word index is used to filter out rare words. In order to detect spam messages, the words that the model will look for in messages would be common words that appear in spam messages; hence the need to record rare words are insignificant. Other than converting to lowercase, punctuations are also removed.  Figure 8. Tokenizer Parameters. In Figure 8, we utilize Keras’s Tokenizer to create the word index. The size that was chosen for the index is 1000 words, meaning 1000 unique words will be loaded into the index. char_level is set to False since we are evaluating word-per-word not letter-per-letter. The oov_token parameter is to specify that we want to take into account words that do not get added into the word index corpus. After the tokenizing above, the messages are sequenced and padded accordingly. The feature length of each message will be limited to the first 50 words. 
Figure 7. Pre-processing data flowchart. 
Model Training Three different neural models will be trained with the pre-processed dataset. Each model is built with Keras’s sequential model. Layers will be added sequentially according to what each model specifies for.  1. Dense Model • The first layer of the dense model will be the embedding layer which is useful for algorithms involving NLP to convert the padded sequence of length 50, into an array of 16 numbers. This involves one-hot encoding as well as dimensionality reduction. Also, the input_length will be 50 as it is the length of our padded sequence. • The second layer involves a global average pooling layer to reduce the parameters used in the model to avoid overfitting. • The third layer is a dense layer with Rectified Linear Unit as its activation function, along with 24 neurons • The fourth layer is a dropout layer to further prevent overfitting. The parameter is 0.2 which randomly assigns input as 0 every (1/0.2=) 5 steps. • The final layer uses Sigmoid as its activation function, outputs probability between 0 and 1, and only has 1 neuron since it is a binary label (Spam/Not Spam).        2. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model • The first layer of the LSTM model will be the embedding layer, same as the previous model. • The second and third layers are LSTM layers stuck horizontally. The point of stacking two LSTM layers as to create a hierarchical feature representation. LSTM is a Recurrent Neural Network, which is useful in sequenced data types, such as words in a sentence in this case. Having multiple layers of LSTM will uncover features derived from the position of words in a sentence relative to other words. It has an integrated Dropout to prevent overfitting which is crucial due to the high complexity nature of LSTM layers. • The final layer uses Sigmoid as its activation function, outputs probability between 0 and 1, and only has 1 neuron since it is a binary label (Spam/Not Spam).   
Figure 9. Dense Architecture. 
Figure 10. LSTM Architecture. 3. Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) Model • The first layer will be the embedding layer, same as the previous models. • The second layer is an LSTM layer wrapped with Bidirectional. The point of using the Bidirectional wrapper is to allow the LSTM nature to propagate both forwards and backwards. It is natural to extract features that relate to the position of word in a sentence, and also incorporating whether a word is before or after another word. It has an integrated Dropout to prevent overfitting which is crucial due to the high complexity nature of Bi-LSTM. • The final layer uses Sigmoid as its activation function, outputs probability between 0 and 1, and only has 1 neuron since it is a binary label (Spam/Not Spam).  Evaluation / Model Selection While training the three neural models, accuracy was above 96% and all models perform similarly with each other. Figure 12 shows the test set accuracy for each of the three models. Figures 13.a-c depicts the train and test set accuracy through epochs of training for all models. 
Figure 11. Bi-LSTM Architecture 
Figure 12. Model Results 
Figure 13a. Dense Model Loss 
Figure 13b. LSTM Model Loss 
Figure 13c. Bi-LSTM Model Loss The results from each of three models are strikingly similar and highly accurate. The models that are built from the message dataset seems to be possessing features that are extractable and recognized by all three neural network models above. As a matter of fact, it seems that both the LSTM and Bi-LSTM models are high in complexity due to the validation error being more steeply increasing than the Dense model. This is crucial to note as the data that was fed into the models comes from one source, specifically a single company. It is likely that the models will be overfitting to features like formal language and company jargons.  In Figure 14, sample messages are passed on to each model to predict. The results are shown on the table. The values shown denote the probability that the message is a spam, classified by each model.          Precision as Metric The neural networks trained above utilizes accuracy as its metric. This means that through every run of the training step, it will reconfigure weights of the neurons with the objective of increasing accuracy. Sometimes accuracy is not the perfect metric to use when training. An unbalanced dataset might introduce a bias in the algorithm to predict a label as the more dominant one. Having multiple-class labels may result in only a few of the labels being considered in the labeling process.   Precision is an alternative to Accuracy. Precision is defined as the ratio between True Positives and All Predicted Positives. In other words, it measures how many percent of the messages that are tagged as spam, are actually spam. If precision is used as the metric in training the models, then the classifier will maximize the percentage of actual spam messages of all the predicted spams. This minimizes the amount of genuine messages labeled as spam.  Another alternative is Recall. Recall is defined as the ratio between True Positives and All Positive Observations. In other words, it measures the percentage of spam message observations that are labeled by the model as spam. If recall is used as the metric in training the models, then the classifier will maximize the percentage of correctly predicted spam messages of all spam message observations. This minimizes the amount of spam messages that are labeled as genuine.   Notice how Precision and Recall are somehow two sides of the same coin. An example where Precision is used would be identifying a good stock to purchase. In this case, the algorithm would rather make a mistake identifying a good stock to buy as bad, rather than misleading 
Figure 14. Sample Predictions users by labeling a bad stock to buy as good. The algorithm cannot afford to make the mistake of labeling a stock as a good one (predicting True, when False) and would play it safe in identifying good stocks when it is certain. An example where Recall is used would be identifying criminals at security checkpoints. In this case, officers would rather make a mistake of identifying a normal person as a criminal than identifying a criminal as a normal person. They can afford to make the mistake of being too careful (predicting True, when False) rather than letting a criminal go through.  In the case of spam detection, precision should be used. Would a person rather receive a spam promotional email in his/her primary inbox or have a very important document sent into the spam inbox? The former should be the more desirable outcome. The algorithm cannot afford to predict a message as spam when it is genuine and should rather predict a message as genuine when it is spam.  Adversarial Attacks Neural network models can be considered the epitome of machine learning. Although it is a new discipline that has outperformed most machine learning models, it has some serious flaws. In 2014, NYU and Google conducted a research into fooling Convolution Neural Networks. The neural network that they tinkered around with was an image detection network that can properly identify the subject of the image.             In Figure 15, the attack starts with a clear picture of a panda. The neural network classifies it as “panda” with 57.7% confidence. However, when the image is altered with noise, the model classifies it as a “gibbon” with 99.3 confidence. The odd fact here is that the image after tampered with the noise seems to not have changed since initially, to the human eye; one can clearly see that it is still a picture of a panda. On top of that, it misclassifies the image as “gibbon” with a confidence level of being close to 100%.   In the case of adversarial attacks to spam filters, a carefully constructed sequence of words might be able to have the same effect as the noise did on the neural network above. Adversarial attacks are much simpler to execute with text since there are more loopholes to watch. For instance, one way to get around the filtering of a spam message would be to convert spam “trigger” words by putting spaces between letters of the word. With this 
Figure 15. Adversarial Attack technique, the tokenizer of the pre-processing stage will miss the fact that these letters are part of the same word and will lead to a spam message being classified as genuine.   The brute-force technique of preventing adversarial attacks is to be the attacker and generate “noise” examples that might mess up the model. The model will then be “told” to not be fooled by manual override and learn not to misclassify with that specific adversarial attack. However, this becomes taxing as it turns into a race between the pseudo-attacker and the attacker.  The intuition behind why neural networks are vulnerable relies on some of its activation functions. It depends on a certain threshold that can easily be manipulated through small tweaks in the datum’s features. It also lies on the fact that most neural network models train on a very small subset of data that it might encounter. Considering that there are usually tens of thousands of parameters in a neural network, a small discrepancy might lead to a large change in its output and overall robustness.  ","The article discusses the use of natural language processing and neural networks for spam detection. The author explains the process of cleaning and preprocessing the data, as well as training three different neural models. The models are evaluated based on accuracy and the results show high accuracy for all three models. The author also discusses the importance of using precision as a metric for spam detection and mentions the vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial attacks."

1 Introduction
In the first quarter of our senior project, we mainly focused on uncertainty quantification with deep
learning models using 3 different methods: quantile regression [ 2], MIS(Mean Interval Score) regres-
sion [ 8], and SG-MCMC [ 1]. And we implemented the first two methods in torchTS. In the second
quarter, our research work focused on the task of advancing quantile regression using the conformal
prediction technique, which provides guaranteed coverage during inference. Additionally, we de-
signed a TimeSeriesDataset class to help prepare time-series data for our predictive model. Lastly,
we helped improve the user experience of torchTS through dedicated library API documentation.
2 Background Info & Motivation
2.1 Task Description
Data that has space and time variables embedded within its structure, or spatiotemporal data, provides
feature-rich information that can be utilized for insights in special tasks. By utilizing deep neural
networks, spatiotemporal analysis can be used to make predictions that forecast trends given previ-
ously recorded data. However, many deep learning applications to spatiotemporal problems currently
fall short with single point-estimates providing no information on the uncertainty that lies within
predictions.
For example, consider an automatic stock trading system where a machine learning model predicts
the stock price. A point prediction from the model might be dramatically different from the real
value because of the high stochasticity of the stock market. But, on the other hand, if the model could
estimate the interval which guarantees coverage of the true value with high probability, the trading
system could compute the best and worst rewards and make more sensible decisions.

Data Science
Over the course of our research, we investigate different implementations of uncertainty quantification
that perform differently based on their implementations and assumptions. By understanding and
characterizing these differences, we hope to implement uncertainty quantification into torchTS in a
manner that aligns with torchTS’ friendly design philosophy.
Beyond this, we also seek to contribute to the torchTS library by implementing a data loader class.
This class was to be designed to preprocess and split up data into training, calibration, and test sets in
a more consistent format for our models to be more easily applied. Lastly, we aim to improve the
torchTS library API documentation to present the library’s functionality in an easily understood way
as well as present users with examples of torchTS’ spatiotemporal analysis methods being used.
2.2 Related Work
Spatiotemporal data involves collecting information with the added dimensions of space and time.
Spatiotemporal data analysis builds upon existing data analysis methodology and can be used to
extract insights with predictions based on the features within a dataset. Spatiotemporal forecasting
implementations vary depending on the specific task. For example, spatial traffic data may have
two data records that close in space and time, yet are mostly unrelated with opposite flow directions
and a barrier.[ 5]. These quirks behind spatiotemporal phenomena mean that novel approaches were
considered when developing analysis techniques suitable for spatiotemporal phenomena.
The further development of Deep Neural Networks has led to their greater adoption within many
domains for problem solving, including the domain of spatiotemporal analysis. In the past, neural
networks could provide accurate predictions, yet were unable to provide a sense of uncertainty
attached to those predictions.[ 3]. Through forms of uncertainty quantification, such as quantile
regression, we hope to enrich our deep learning applications to spatiotemporal data with the missing
uncertainty values.
[6] proposed a conformal quantile regression model which aimed to combine the strengths of
conformal prediction, which produces a confidence interval using finite samples, without making
distributional assumptions, and quantile regression, which is adaptive to heteroscedasticity. They
also proved the coverage guarantee with predictions using this strategy. In our work, we primarily
adopt the model methodology from the above paper, and implement our code largely dependent on
the conformal example Romano et al. provided.
We also refer to [ 7], in which they applied the conformal prediction on dynamic time-series. In their
work, [ 7] proposed a conformal prediction method that could aggregate bootstraps from the trained
estimators to avoid outfitting. Specifically, their method did not require data-splitting nor training
multiple estimators, which made the model easier to implement. We will target this method in the
future.
2.3 Motivation
The motivation of adding uncertainty quantification prediction to our model in torchTS is to provide a
guarantee of valid coverage with high probability that prediction intervals hold the true value. In other
words, if we use conformal prediction method in our model, when we make prediction intervals, the
intervals will cover most of possible outcomes. This is crucial in many real-world applications such
as stock price prediction, insurance calculation, and risk assessment, etc. because it helps minimize
the risks.
3 Uncertainty Quantification
3.1 Quantile Regression
The first model we explore is quantile regression where we generate one quantile prediction each
time the model is trained. Training this model multiple times with different quantile levels provides
us with a confidence interval which demonstrates uncertainty quantification at our desired levels of
2confidence. For this implementation, the loss function calculates a quantile loss called the pinball
loss function, defined as:
LQuantile (y, f(x), θ, p))
=min θ{E(x,y)∼D[(y−f(x))(p−⊮{y < f (x)})]}
Where our loss is computed as a function of the actual value y, the input x, output f(x) of a neural
network, and our fixed confidence level p, parameterized by θ. One potential issue using this model
is that the prediction for different quantiles may cross each other if the amount of data the model is
trained on is not large enough. In order to artificially increase the data we train this model on, we can
sample multiple different subsets of data from our training dataset.
3.2 MIS Regression
The second model we investigate is Mean Interval Score (MIS) Regression. We run the model
multiple times, each time updating our parameters according to a loss function that is mathematically
the same as MIS, also known as Winkler loss, and is formalized as:
MIS =1
hPh
j=1((ut+j−lt+j)+2
α(lt+j−yt+j)1(yt+j< lt+j)+2
α(yt+j−ut+j)1(yt+j> ut+j))
Within our investigation, we fix our confidence level ( α) at 95%, since if more than one confidence
level were to be used the runtime complexity of computing MIS would multiply by n. 1is an
indicator function in this equation, where the function value should be treated as 1 when the inequality
condition is true and 0 when the inequality condition is false.
This loss function is comprised of 3 sections. The first section produces a penalty the size of the
distance between the upper and lower bounds of our predicted interval. The second section produces
a penalty the size of the distance between the lower bound and the actual value, scaled by2
αwhen the
actual value is less than that of the lower bound. The third part produces a penalty the size of the
distance between the actual value and the upper bound scaled by2
αwhen the actual value is higher
than the predicted value. Since the loss function of MIS regression jointly includes the upper and
lower bounds, the result outputs both, unlike quantile regression.
3.3 SG-MCMC
The final model we examine is stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo. This form of gradient
descent is useful in allowing us to calculate our quantiles according to subsets of the training data set
which are selected based on the posterior distribution over the parameter space. Also, we follow the
stochastic gradient thermostat method (SGNHT), whose purpose is to control gradient noise, which
is typically characterized by heavy tails. We generate samples of model parameters θas a function of
our loss function L( θ), diffusion coefficients A, and learning rate h, in addition to auxiliary variables
pϵRdandζ ϵR. We randomly initialize θ, p, and ζand update according to the rule:
θk+1=θk+pkh
pk+1=pk−L(θ)h−ζkpkh+N(0,2Ah)
ζk+1=ζk+pt
kpk
d−1
h
Where after the kth iteration, θfollows the distribution of the posterior. By running for multiple θ
with different samples according to the posterior, we quantify the uncertainty of our prediction.
3.4 Conformal Prediction
In order to improve upon previous results, we introduce conformal prediction to our quantile re-
gression model. Conformal prediction is useful because it guarantees coverage of our prediction
interval at our chosen significance level. Using conformal prediction, we guarantee that our desired
prediction lies within our confidence interval with a fixed level of confidence. Additionally, conformal
prediction is well suited to our needs for several reasons. It works with any data, without distributional
3assumptions, it does not require analyzing or retraining, as data is fed into a neural network, and it
costs relatively little in terms of computation.
In order to incorporate conformal prediction into the model, a calibration data set must be partitioned
in addition to training, testing and validation sets. This is data which will be used only after the
model is trained, so that the prediction intervals may be adjusted using conformal prediction before
finally evaluating our results. The adjustments made to our original quantile prediction intervals by
the conformal prediction process are done in a few steps. First, a distribution of predictions is created,
where the predicted values from our quantile regression are scored based on the confidence of the
prediction. Then, a threshold value is calculated for which at least 95%, or another fixed confidence
level, of our data have a score for the correct interval above that value. This is done by taking the
1 - 95%, or 5%, quantile from the scored predictions. Lastly, our prediction interval is created by
including values whose scores exceed this threshold value.
4 Model Implementation for torchTS
As part of our quarter 1 initiatives, we wanted to merge these uncertainty quantification methodologies
into a usable suite of tools that focus on spatiotemporal analysis. TorchTS is a library built upon
pytorch-lightning, a module that provides an organized framework for implementing custom models,
which allows for it to provide specialized machine learning tools for spatiotemporal data.
In quarter 1, we worked on an extension to the torchTS codebase that implements a quantile loss
function, which provides uncertainty information in our forecasts by bounding our forecasts with
models trained on 25%, 50%, and 75% confidence levels. The predictions from the 50% confidence
level trained model provides the conventional prediction, while the 25% and 75% confidence level
predictions serve as under and over-estimates that are represented in the variation in our model
performance amongst various retrainings.
This quarter, we worked on further extend the torchTS by implementing conformal quantile regression.
After the model trained on the original quantile regression model, we conformalized the predicted
interval using the calibration set. First, we used our nonconformal predictor to predict the interval
(upper bound and lower bound) for the calibration set, and then we calculated the difference between
the true Yiand our prediction and found the target residual value das described in section 4.2. Finally,
we updated our former prediction by adding dto previous upper bound and subtracting dfrom
previous lower bound. The final result we obtained is the conformalized interval, which has the
properties that it guarantee coverage with smallest length possible.
44.1 Quantile Regression Development
(a) Reproduced Quantile Regression Model
(b) Original Paper Quantile Regression Model
Figure 1: Quantile Regression Model Visualization Compression
During quarter 1, we replicated the results in SpatiotemporalUQ using quantile model. For the
COVID19 dataset, we chose to follow the original uncertainty quantification paper by not predicting
the death number, but forecasting the residual in order to better replicate the results and accuracy of
the paper.
In our visualization, we picked the first 15 states from the United States in alphabetical order for
comparison. For the Quantile regression model, we plot our results in Figure 1a.
By comparing with the original paper results in Figure 1b, we found out that our prediction from
the trainings has the same overall shape as the original paper. However, our results appear to have a
larger confidence interval. We hypothesize that this may be due to our insufficient training steps, and
we will examine this by retraining using different patience.
4.2 Conformal Quantile Regression [CQR] Development
Our work during the second half of our research sought to add on to and improve our quantile
regression from our prior work. To this end, we conformalize our quantile regression prediction. The
expected result of adding conformal prediction to our model is a guarantee of valid coverage with
high probability that prediction intervals hold the true value of a metric.
Conformal quantile regression can be implemented in a few different styles. Since we are focused
on implementing code in our library that is able to run on computers with processing power that
is increasingly accessible to the general public, we focus on inductive conformal prediction (ICP) ,
which is a type of conformal prediction that invokes a regression function a finite number of times.
In order to perform ICP, we are required to split our training dataset equally into two new datasets:
training and calibration [6].
Once we obtain our new training dataset, we proceed to train our nonconformal predictor (NCP),
in our case a quantile regressor, which trains a given model for an upper confidence bound (0.975
quantile), a median (0.5 quantile), and a lower confidence bound (0.025 quantile). These construct
5the confidence band that we will build on in our conformal quantile regressor. It is important to note
that for this step, we have specified a fixed desired confidence level of 95%, which is where we get
the range of (0.025, 0.975) for our confidence band.
Following the inital NCP training to obtain a confidence band, we perform the first step of the
conformalization process. The conformalization process involves us using our new calibration set
to update the NCP-predicted calibration bands to achieve enough coverage to satisfy a specified
confidence level. We begin by calculating the difference between the true Yifrom our new calibration
set and each of the upper and lower bands obtained through our NCP, which are the residuals of our
model’s predictions. For each entry of our calibration set, we select the smaller of the two residuals:
the upper band residual, or the lower band residual. We then sort our selected residuals in descending
order and find the residual where 1−αof the values pertaining to each entry in our calibration set
are larger than it. We take this residual value, which we will call d, and use it to adjust our predicted
NCP confidence bands by subtracting it from our former lower band, Lprev and add it to our former
upper band, Uprev to obtain
Lupdated =Lprev−d
Uupdated =Uprev+d
This split conformal process provides conformalization with the performance cost equivalent to fitting
our NCP and provides us with aforementioned coverage guarantee [4].
Our resulting conformal quantile regression code before adaptation to the respective torchTS format
provides us with modified bands that guarantee 95% coverage when trained and predicted over a
randomly generated trend line with noise.

5 TorchTS’ User Experience Enhancement
Users can now easily view the library’s API documentation on the official website. We used
Sphinx to auto-generate torchTS API documentation based on class and function docstrings with
pytorch-theme. We also used Docusaurus V2 to easily generate torchTS’ official website. Then, we
merged Sphinx into Docusaurus V2 so that users can view both torchTS tutorials and API docs on
the official website. We implemented customized Github Action workflows such that every commit
to the main branch will trigger a new build for the package and the official website, and thus, every
PR merge will automatically update our API docs and tutorials.
6Also, we are working on the Getting Started section so that users can quickly understand how to use
this library and how they can benefit from it.
6 Discussion and Future Work
An important aspect of maintaining and growing the torchTS library is to make it easy for others
to contribute code to the repository. TorchTS is built with the intention of making spatiotemporal
analysis more accessible and open. In order to do this, more descriptive docstrings and more guides
on contributing would greatly improve the quality of users’ experiences. Additionally, as noted above
there are many approaches to the same problem such as with uncertainty quantification. TorchTS
would greatly benefit from the option of choosing from a variety of different model implementations,
while maintaining the elegance of making methods simple and intuitive for the common user. We
hope that the groundwork laid within documentation efforts and implementations of uncertainty
quantification helps in guiding the project to becoming more widely utilized in the future.

 Abstract 
 Having observed data seems to be a necessary requirement to conduct inference, but what  
 happens when observed outcomes cannot easily be obtained? The simplest practice seems to  
 proceed with using predicted outcomes, but without any corrections this can result in issues like  
 bias and incorrect standard errors. Our project studies a correction method for inference  
 conducted on predicted, not observed outcomes—called post-prediction inference—through the  
 lens of political data. W e are investigating the kinds of phrases or words in a tweet that will most  
 strongly indicate a person’ s political alignment to US politics. W e have discovered that these  
 correction techniques are promising in their ability to correct for post-prediction inference in the  
 field of political science.  
 1 Intro 
 Machine learning is a modern task in data science that uses observed data values to model and  
 predict data. It takes advantage of having observed data available, but what should be done when  
 observed data cannot be obtained? A common practice is to use predicted values when observed  
 values are unavailable, but without any corrections we inevitably run into issues such as  
 incorrect standard errors, bias, and inflated false positive rates.  
 Wang et al. proposes a method to correct inference done on predicted outcomes–which they  
 name post-prediction inference, or postpi–in   Methods   for corr ecting infer ence based on  
 outcomes pr edicted by machine learning   . This statistical   technique takes advantage of the  
 standard structure for machine learning and uses bootstrapping to correct statistical error when  
 using predicted values in place of observed values.  
 We are exploring the applicability of W ang et al.’ s postpi bootstrapping technique on political  
 data–that is, on political twitter posts. Our project will be investigating what kinds of phrases or  
 words in a tweet will strongly indicate a person’ s political alignment, in the context of US  
 politics. By doing so, we can simultaneously test how the bootstrap post-prediction inference  
 approach interacts with text data and how this method can be generally applicable towards  
 analyses in political science.  
 2 Methodology 
 The postpi bootstrap approach by W ang et al. is a method that aims to correct inference in studies  
 that use predicted outcomes in lieu of observed outcomes. It is ef fective due to its simplicity–this  
 approach is not dependent on deriving the first principles of the prediction model, so we are free  
 to focus on accuracy without worrying about the impact of the complexity of the model on the   bootstrap approach. The reason why it is not dependent is because this approach utilizes an easily  
 generalizable and low-dimensional relationship between observed and predicted outcomes.  
 There are four assumptions that the postpi bootstrap approach rests on:  
 1.  The training, testing, and validation dataset must all arise from the same distribution, and  
 the training and testing set must have observed outcomes to train the prediction and  
 relationship model.  
 2.  There must be a simple, low-dimensional relationship between observed and predicted  
 outcomes.  
 3.  The relationship model arising from the relationship above must be consistent for the  
 validation set and for any future data.  
 4.  The features used when conducting inference must be present in the training and testing  
 data, and used to train the prediction model.  
 An implementation of this algorithm is provided below:  
 3 Data 
 3.1 Data Collection  
 We collected our data by scraping tweets from US politicians from T witter . Specifically , we took  
 the T witter handles of the President, V ice President, and all the members of US Congress except  
 Representatives Chris Smith (R-NJ) and Jef ferson V an Drew (R-NJ), as they have both deleted  
 their T witter accounts. These T witter handles were compiled and provided by the   UCSD library   , 
 and outdated names or T witter handles were updated manually by ourselves. Additionally , the 
 two Independent members of Congress–Senators Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Angus King  
 (I-ME)–will be considered Democratic politicians for our purposes, as they caucus with  
 Democrats.  
 Using these T witter handles, we scraped approximately 100 tweets from each politician, although  
 the exact number of tweets pulled from each individual will fluctuate as not all members of  
 Congress use T witter with the same frequency as their colleagues. Our final dataset consists of  
 44,328 tweets for an average of 82 tweets per politician. Of these tweets, 22,653 tweets are from  
 Democrats, 21,478 tweets are from Republicans, and 197 tweets are from Independents  
 (converted to Democrats).  
 3.2 Cleaning T ext Data  
 To prepare our data for prediction and feature selection, we cleaned the tweets by expanding all  
 contractions, converted all text into lowercase format, and removed urls, punctuation, and  
 unicode characters. Additionally , we also removed stopwords, using the dictionary of stopwords  
 provided by NL TK to do so.  
 3.3 Exploratory Data Analysis  
 Our data consists of a relatively equal number of tweets leaning either Democratic or  
 Republican. As said earlier , with Independent politicians counting as Democrats, there are a total  
 of 44,328 tweets–22,850 are classified as tweets from Democrats, while 21,478 are classified as  
 tweets from Republicans.  
 We look at Figure 1 for a first glance at the data. Figure 1 is an overlaid histogram plotting the  
 number of words in tweets from Democrats and Republicans. While both histograms are clearly  
 skewed to the left, we can see that the distribution of the length of tweets for Democrats has a  
 higher peak than the distribution for Republicans, which tells us that tweets from Democrats  
 average more words compared to their counterparts on the opposite aisle. This could imply that  
 the prediction model will utilize more vocabulary from Democrat-classified tweets than  
 Republican, which might have interesting ef fects on the prediction model and thus the bootstrap  
 algorithm and inference.   Figur e 1  : A histogram depicting the number of words   in a tweet by party . We can see that  
 Democrats generally have longer tweets compared to Republicans.  
 We take a deeper dive into each party in Figure 2 below , which lists the 10 most frequent words  
 used by Democrats and Republicans, excluding stopwords. There are very few commonalities  
 between either party–only two words are commonly used by both parties: ‘today’ and ‘year ’. 
 Democrats seem to focus on policy issues as suggested by ‘act’ and ‘infrastructure’, but  
 otherwise their attentions are spread across a multitude of topics as no single unifying issue  
 seems to be able to group together their most frequently used words. On the other hand,  
 Republicans seem to focus more on their political opponents–words such as ‘biden’, ‘democrats’,  
 and ‘president’ seem to suggest that–and on the American people. There is notably a significant  
 reference to ‘biden’, with the President’ s name being used approximately 3500 times, almost  
 double the frequency of the second most popular word. As such, Figure 2 shows us that  
 Republican-classified tweets may revolve more strongly around certain themes, such as their  
 opponents, compared to Democrat-classified tweets. Again, this may influence the prediction  
 model and in turn the inference conducted on our features.  
 Figur e 2  : Bar plots depicting the most frequent words   used by either party . We can also see a  
 significant dif ference in the most frequent words used by either party–only ‘today’ and ‘year ’ is 
 a word that both parties use in common.  
 4 Methods 
 4.1 Pr ediction and Relationship Model  
 During this stage of our project, we worked on maximizing the accuracy of our prediction model.  
 We compared several dif ferent prediction models in the process of coming up with our final  
 model, trying other classification algorithms such as logistic regression and ridge regression  
 (regularized). After determining which model performed the best, we tuned hyperparameters on  
 the final model to further improve its performance. In the end, we used a TF-IDF vectorization  
 model with 200,000 features and 1-3 words per feature, and an SVC model for prediction, with a  
 linear kernel and C=1.5.  
 Following the method that W ang et al. used to prepare the prediction data for the bootstrap postpi  
 method, we used our prediction model to generate the probability distribution for each tweet–the  
 probability of it being classified as Democratic or Republican-leaning–and used this data and the  
 observed outcomes from the test dataset to build a relationship model. W e used a K-NN machine  
 learning model for this as we found it to describe the relationship between the predicted and  
 observed outcomes well compared to other models like logistic regression.  
 4.2 Featur e Selection for Infer ence  
 We reviewed relevant literature in political science to develop a criteria for choosing our  
 features.  
 In  Twitter Language Use Reflects Psychological Differ ences   between Democrats and  
 Republicans   , Sylwester and Purver discuss the dif ferences   between Democrats and Republicans  
 in the context of previous findings and their own discoveries. For example, Haidt’ s Moral  
 Foundations model, which identifies “harm, fairness, liberty , ingroup, authority , and purity” as  
 the pillars of morality , has been used to distinguish between liberals and conservatives. It was  
 found that liberals prioritized the harm and fairness aspects of morality , while conservatives  
 focused more on liberty , ingroup, authority , and purity . Sylwester and Purver also found  
 differences between Democratic and Republican-aligned people when it came to what kinds of  
 topics they discussed and emotions they expressed–Republicans focused more on topics such as  
 “religion…, national identity…, government and law…, and their opponents” while Democrats  
 were focused on emphasizing their uniqueness and generally expressed more anxiety and  
 emotion. These findings are somewhat in line with our own observations made through the  
 data–as stated before, we found that Republican tweets made references to their opponents on a  
 much lar ger scale than Democrats, and also made mention of the American people–their national  
 identity–plenty of times as well.  
 We also reviewed Chen et al.’ s study ,  #Election2020:   the first public T witter dataset on the 2020  
 US Pr esidential election   .  Chen et al. found that more   conservative T witter users tended to share  
 more topics related to conspiracy theories and “public health and voting misinformation”  
 compared to liberal T witter users.  
 Taking these two sources into consideration, our criteria for selecting features was whether or not  
 they would fall into either liberal or conservative tendencies as discovered by either source. If a  
 feature implied a discussion of harm or fairness, or was an expression of uniqueness, anxiety , or 
 emotion, then we anticipated that this feature would connect more to Democratic-aligned tweets.  
 On the other hand, if a feature discussed liberty , purity , religion, national identity , government  
 and law , or Republican opponents, or implied that the topic at hand was associated with public  
 health or voting misinformation, said feature may be connected to Republican-aligned tweets.  
 We ended up selecting 5 features to conduct inference, which are border , illegal, god, defund,  
 and happy . We hypothesized that the first three would be strong indicators for a  
 Republican-classified tweet as they allude to national identity , law , and religion, while the last  
 two would indicate a Democratic-classified tweet as they allude to concepts of harm and  
 fairness, as well as emotion.  
 5 Results 
 After conducting inference using the bootstrap postpi algorithm, we found that the parametric  
 bootstrap method worked best to correct for inference. As such, for the inference we interpret  
 below we will only be considering the corrections made using the parametric method, and not the  
 non-parametric bootstrap method.   5.1 Infer ence on ‘border ’ 
 The table below shows the results of conducting inference on the word ‘border ’. The bootstrap  
 postpi algorithm corrects coef ficients, SEs, and t-statistics as mentioned above and the results  
 below shows that the algorithm works as intended. The true beta coef ficient has a value of 7.491,  
 but in the case that we didn’ t have the observed values, using the bootstrap postpi algorithm  
 would correct the coef ficient to 7.498. The corrected value is a better estimate for the coef ficient  
 compared to the no correction approach value of 8.272.  The coef ficient was corrected by an  
 absolute dif ference of 0.007. The SE for a no correction approach results in an absolute  
 difference of 0.018 to the true value, but after correction, the absolute dif ference decreases to  
 0.011. The t-statistic for the no correction approach results in an absolute dif ference of 0.72  
 while the corrected approach resulted in an absolute dif ference of 0.125. These results are  
 meaningful because the smaller dif ferences would suggest that we have a good bootstrap model  
 that corrects inference using predicted values instead of observed values.  
 A positive coef ficient for the word ‘border ’ implies that this feature is a good predictor for the  
 Republican party . To compare how much better the correction was on the coef ficient we can  
 compute the odds ratio. Using the actual value, Republicans are approximately  
 times more likely to use the   word ‘border ’ than Democrats. The odds when   𝑒  7 . 491 = 1791 . 843 
 using the coef ficient with no correction would tell us that Republicans are approximately  
 times more likely to use the   word ‘border ’ than Democrats, which is over      𝑒  8 . 272 = 3912 . 767 
 2000 times more than the actual odds. The odds when we use the corrected coef ficient would tell  
 us that Republicans are approximately   times more likely to use the word      𝑒  7 . 498 = 1804 . 430 
 ‘border ’ than Democrats, which is relatively close to the odds of the true coef ficient.  
 To test whether the feature is a statistically significant predictor we must evaluate the t-statistic.  
 If the null hypothesis was true–that there is no significant dif ference between Republicans and  
 Democrats in their use of the word ‘border ’–then we would expect a sample with no dif ference.  
 Since the corrected t-statistic of ~ 8.966 is greater than 2, we have 95% confidence that there is a  
 positive dif ference between our sample data and the null hypothesis. This implies that the word  
 ‘border ’ is a good predictor for the Republican party .

 The table below shows the results of conducting inference on the word ‘illegal’. The true beta  
 coefficient has a value of 5.790, but in the case that we did not have the observed values, using  
 the bootstrap postpi algorithm would correct the coef ficient to 5.832. The corrected value is a  
 better estimate for the coef ficient compared to the no correction approach value of 6.392.  The  
 SE for the no correction approach results in an absolute dif ference of 0.004 but after running the  
 bootstrap postpi algorithm, the absolute dif ference decreased to 0.003. The t-statistic for a no  
 correction approach results in an absolute dif ference of 0.529 while the corrected absolute  
 difference resulted in 0.051. These results are meaningful because the smaller dif ferences would  
 suggest that we have a good bootstrap model that corrects inference using predicted values  
 instead of observed values.  
 A positive coef ficient for the word ‘illegal’ implies that this feature is a good predictor for the  
 Republican party . To compare how much better the correction was on the coef ficient we can  
 compute the odds ratio. Using the actual value, Republicans are approximately  
 times more likely to use the word   ‘illegal’ than Democrats. The odds when   𝑒  5 . 790 = 327 . 013 
 using the coef ficient with no correction would tell us that Republicans are approximately

 200 times more than the actual odds. The odds when we use the corrected coef ficient would tell  
 us that Republicans are approximately   times more likely to use the word      𝑒  5 . 832 = 341 . 040 
 ’illegal’ than Democrats, which is relatively close to the odds ratio calculated from the true  
 coefficient.  
 To test whether the feature is a statistically significant predictor we must evaluate the t-statistic.  
 If the null hypothesis was true–that there is no significant dif ference between Republicans and  
 Democrats in their use of the word ‘illegal’– then we would expect a sample with no dif ference.  
 Since the corrected t-statistic of ~ 5.335 is greater than 2, we have 95% confidence that there is a

 The table below shows the results of conducting inference on the word ‘god’. The true beta  
 coefficient has a value of 4.897, but in the case that we didn’ t have the observed values, using the  
 bootstrap postpi algorithm corrects the coef ficient to 4.779. The corrected value is a better  
 estimate for the coef ficient compared to the no correction approach value of 5.447.  The  
 coefficient was corrected by an absolute dif ference of 0.55. The SE for a no correction approach  
 results in an absolute dif ference of 0.007 to the true value, but after correction, the absolute  
 difference increased to 0.018. The t-statistic for the no correction approach results in an absolute  
 difference of 0.493 while the corrected approach resulted in an absolute dif ference of 0.036.  
 These results are meaningful because the smaller dif ferences would suggest that we have a good  
 bootstrap model that corrects inference using predicted values instead of observed values.  
 A positive coef ficient for the word ‘god’ implies that this feature is a good predictor for the  
 Republican party . To compare how much better the correction was on the coef ficient we can  
 compute the odds ratio. Using the actual value, Republicans are approximately  
 times more likely to use the word   ‘god’ than Democrats. The odds calculated   𝑒  4 . 897 = 133 . 888 
 using the coef ficient with no correction would tell us that Republicans are approximately  
 times more likely to use the   word ‘god’ than Democrats, which is more than      𝑒  5 . 447 = 232 . 061 
 100 times the actual odds. The odds when we use the corrected coef ficient would tell us that  
 Republicans are approximately   times more likely to use the word’ god’ than      𝑒  4 . 779 = 118 . 985 
 Democrats, which is relatively close to the odds of the true coef ficient.  
 To test whether the feature is a statistically significant predictor we must evaluate the t-statistic.  
 If the null hypothesis was true–that there is no significant dif ference between Republicans and  
 Democrats in their use of the word ‘god’– then we would expect a sample with no dif ference.  
 Since the corrected t-statistic of ~ 4.720 is greater than 2, we have 95% confidence that there is a

 The table below shows the results of conducting inference on the word ‘defund’. The true beta  
 coefficient has a value of 1.181, but in the case that we didn’ t have the observed values, using the  
 bootstrap postpi algorithm would correct the coef ficient to 1.076. The corrected value is a better  
 estimate for the coef ficient compared to the no correction approach value of 1.51 1.  The  
 coefficient was corrected by an absolute dif ference of 0.105. The SE for a no correction approach  
 results in an absolute dif ference of 0.002 but after running the bootstrap postpi algorithm, the  
 absolute dif ference decreased to 0.0001. The T -Statistic for a no correction approach results in an  
 absolute dif ference of 0.173 while the corrected absolute dif ference resulted in 0.055. These  
 results are meaningful because the smaller dif ferences would suggest that we have a good  
 bootstrap model that corrects inference using predicted values instead of observed values.  
 To compare how much better the correction was on the coef ficient we can compute the odds  
 ratio. Using the actual value, Republicans are approximately   times more likely to   𝑒  1 . 181 = 3 . 26 
 use the word ‘defund’ than Democrats. The odds when using the coef ficient with no correction  
 would tell us that, Republicans are approximately   times more likely to use the      𝑒  1 . 511 = 4 . 53 
 word ‘defund’ than Democrats, which is close to the actual odds. The odds when we use the  
 corrected coef ficient would tell us that, Republicans are approximately   times      𝑒  1 . 076 = 2 . 933 
 more likely to use the word ’defund’ than Democrats, which is closer to the odds calculated  
 using the true coef ficient.  
 Interestingly , conducting inference on the feature ‘defund’ yielded a positive coef ficient, which  
 implies that this feature is a good predictor for the Republican party , and not the Democratic  
 party contrary to our hypothesis.  
 To test whether the feature is a statistically significant predictor we must evaluate the t-statistic.  
 If the null hypothesis was true–that there is no significant dif ference between Republicans and  
 Democrats in their use of the word ‘defund’– then we would expect a sample with no dif ference.  
 Since the corrected T -Statistic of ~ 0.560 is less than 2 and greater than -2, we have 95%  
 confidence that there is not a positive dif ference between our sample data and the null  
 hypothesis. This implies that the word ‘defund’ is not a good predictor for the Republican party .

 The table below shows the results of conducting inference on the word ‘happy’. The true beta  
 coefficient has a value of 0.935, but in the case that we didn’ t have the observed values, using the  
 bootstrap postpi algorithm would correct the coef ficient to 0.959. The corrected value is a better  
 estimate for the coef ficient compared to the no correction approach value of 1.137. The SE for a  
 no correction approach results in an absolute dif ference of 0.001 but after running the bootstrap  
 postpi algorithm, the absolute dif ference increased to 0.0045. The T -Statistic for a no correction  
 approach results in an absolute dif ference of 0.406 while the corrected absolute dif ference  
 resulted in 0.0321. These results are meaningful because the smaller dif ferences would suggest  
 that we have a good bootstrap model that corrects inference using predicted values instead of  
 observed values.  
 To compare how much better the correction was on the coef ficient we can compute the odds  
 ratio. Using the actual value, republicans are approximately   times more likely to   𝑒  0 . 935 = 2 . 547 
 use the word ‘happy’ than Democrats. The odds when using the coef ficient with no correction  
 would tell us that, Republicans are approximately   times more likely to use the      𝑒  1 . 137 = 3 . 117 
 word ‘happy’ than Democrats, which is close to the actual odds. The odds when we use the  
 corrected coef ficient would tell us that, Republicans are approximately   times      𝑒  0 . 959 = 2 . 609 
 more likely to use the word ’happy’ than Democrats, which is closer to the odds of the true  
 coefficient.  
 Once again, we find that inference on the feature ‘happy’ also yielded a positive coef ficient,  
 which tells us that this feature is a good predictor for the Republican party , and not the  
 Democratic party . This is, again, contrary to what we hypothesized would be the case.  
 To test whether the feature is a statistically significant predictor we must evaluate the t-statistic.  
 If the null hypothesis was true–that there is no significant dif ference between Republicans and  
 Democrats in their use of the word ‘happy’– then we would expect a sample with no dif ference.  
 Since the corrected T -Statistic of ~ 1.920 is less than 2 and greater than -2, we have 95%  
 confidence that there is no positive dif ference between our sample data and the null hypothesis.  
 This implies that the word ‘happy’ is not a good predictor for the Republican party .

 We can conclude from the results above that the bootstrap postpi algorithm is promising for  
 providing post-prediction inference correction for text data and for the field of political science.  
 The correction is small but keep in mind that the goal of the bootstrap postpi algorithm is to  
 correct inference using predicted values, and that has succeeded.  
 We tested whether the features ‘border ’, ‘illegal’, and ‘god’ would be strong indicators for a  
 Republican-classified tweet as they allude to national identity , law , and religion. Similarly we  
 tested that the other two features, ‘defund’ and ‘happy’, would indicate a Democratic-classified  
 tweet as they allude to concepts of harm and fairness, as well as emotion.  
 Based on the results, ‘border ’, ‘illegal’, and ‘god’ are strong predictors towards classifying a  
 republican tweet. On the contrary , ‘defund’ and ‘happy’ were not strong predictors towards  
 classifying a democratic tweet or republican tweet. Thus we can ar gue that the hypotheses we  
 derived from literature review were half correct. There is statistical evidence that Republicans  
 tend to use language that alludes to national identity , law , and religion but there is not enough  
 evidence to ar gue that Democratic tweets tend to discuss concepts of harm, fairness and emotion.  
 These findings are applicable in several ways. For example, politicians can use our discoveries to  
 appeal to Republicans’ values during a campaign by using language that alludes to national  
 identity , law , and religion. The ability to resonate with people is vital for a politician to win  
 elections and to advance their agenda. Minute changes in language to appeal to their audience  
 can be the dif ference between a winning or losing campaign.  
 That being said, there are some limitations. One limitation of W ang et al.’ s bootstrap algorithm is  
 that the feature has to be present in the training/testing set, thus inference on features that are not  
 present in the training or testing dataset is not able to be done. Another limitation is that the  
 bootstrap algorithm may have unexpected results in text data, owing to the fact that some  
 selected features may not appear much at all in the data. It is also important to consider how one  
 chooses to pre-process text data; the removal of certain stem words or suf fixes can lead to  
 unexpected results.  
 In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the bootstrap postpi algorithm first developed by W ang 
 et al. is shown to correct predicted outcomes when observed outcomes are not available on  
 political data. In such a field where collecting observed outcomes can be exceedingly  
 time-consuming and expensive to collect, this is a significant finding that may open doors to  
 some studies that may otherwise be too dif ficult to conduct.   7 References

Applying Post-Prediction Inference to Sports Analysis
1. Introduction
For our project, my group decided to use our domain methodology research of post-prediction inference
(postpi) and apply it to sports analysis based on the outcomes of past NFL  games. We designed a model that can
predict the outcome of a football game, such as which team will win and what the mar gin of their victory will
be, and then corrected the statistical inference for selected key features. The main goals of our investigation is
discerning which features most strongly determine the victor of a football game, and subsequently which
features provide the most significant information to predict the mar gin of that victory . For example, does the
home field advantage increase a team’ s chance of winning by 7 points? Is the comparative of fense to defense
rating the most critical factor in securing a win? Does temperature on gameday play a statistically significant
part in influencing mar gin of victory? These are just some of the questions we have brought up to seek an
answer during the course of our research, and by conducting this project we are attempting to revolutionize the
way NFL  analytics are conducted via a more accurate statistical method of inference, postpi.
2. Data Collection
To begin a data science project, one requires data. Surprisingly so, the process of data collection was
quite a bit more grueling than we had hoped. NFL  datasets themselves and websites dedicated to NFL  data are
abundant yet almost none of them were helpful. We began our data search by hoping we would easily find one
or two websites with all of the information we wanted neatly wrapped in uniform csv files just waiting to be
merged together , however , much to our disappointment this was not the case at all. One website might have all
of the of fensive ratings for NFL  teams from 2000-2021 yet lack any of the defensive ratings (which are just as
important), and another website might have the complimentary defensive ratings but only from 1993-2010, and
also set up in a completely unique format so as to make the prospect of data mer ging nightmarish at best. We
had hoped that maybe such a scenario would only be true for a couple of the features we wanted, but as it were
to get the minimum features we needed with suf ficient data points to allow for any reasonable machine learning
model to be accurate we were looking at having to mer ge 10+ websites’  csv files all formatted uniquely and
encompassing dif ferent year ranges. Our stroke of luck came when Sujeet discovered the website
https://stathead.com/football/
, which contains all
of the features we needed, for all of the years that we needed,
and all formatted in a very similar way . The catch was that we had to pay $8 a month each to get access to the
csv files for the tar get features. Additionally , we only had access to 100 rows of data, in csv text form, at a time
for each individual game statistic (you had to click next at the bottom of the page to go on to rows 200-299, etc)2
and considering that there were 5,632 NFL  games played from 2000 to 2021, and further considering we had 10
target features, this took a lot of tedious manual labor . The data only represented 5,600 games, however the
number of observations was double this due to the fact that a game involved two teams and there are two entries
for each individual game. This is an important aspect of our data because otherwise any model that we create
down the line would bias our Spread predictions, because the Spread column would either only contain all
positive values or negative values. To avoid this, we included all the observations in our dataset, which also
further increased the time it required to collect all the data.
3. Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis
After we divided up the features we determined could explain the variance in NFL  game spread, we
pushed our combined data to the Github repository , and we set out on our next step of a data science project:
Exploratory Data Analysis. Mer ging the datasets together wasn’ t as challenging as it could have been simply
because all of our data came from the same place, and all of the features shared multiple columns. The
combined dataset consisted of 64 total columns ranging from the year the game took place in, to the number of
passes completed in the game, to number of sacks allowed in the game, etc. Many of the columns were
redundant, like having the number of passes attempted, the number of passes completed, and then the percent of
passes completed (making the previous two unnecessary). In several instances columns were included for the
winning teams but not for the opponents (an analysis on the importance of rushing yards must include how
many yards both the winner
and
loser ran for). Additionally ,
several columns were present that were objectively
not helpful and could be removed to help declutter the dataframe, like the “year” column while also having the
“date” column, which included year . Some other columns also needed to be transformed because they weren’ t
in a format that was machine learning ready . For example, our dataset contained one column called “Result”
which contained the result of each game in the form of a string like “W  12-9”. This represents the result of each
observation in the following format: “TmOutcome TmScore - OppScore”. “Tm” in this dataset represents the
NFL team that has it’ s game statistics
listed first, and “Opp” represents the
NFL team that has it’ s game statistics
listed after . This is why our dataset has
twice the number of rows as the
number of games because the same
game can be listed in an opposite
order which would contain the result
column as the following: “L  9-12”.
Another column that needed
transformation is the “Home” column
3
because it contained an “@” symbol in the data when the “Tm” was at the “Opp” stadium, meaning it was a
home game for the “Opp”. To fix this, we changed the column to a binary column representing when “Tm” was
at home for the given game.
With a refined dataframe in hand we moved on to dealing with null values. A heatmap of null values,
figure above, allowed us to visually identify 9 columns that had between 100 and 301 null values, with
temperature having almost 2500 missing values. As 300 data points out of 1 1,000 is quite low , we opted to
impute the missing values by randomly sampling from the respective columns. For the temperature column, we
imputed the remaining null values again based on randomly sampling from the rest of the data points in the
temperature column. Applying our methods for dealing
with null values removed we had a final count of 1 1,148
data points.
Once addressing the missing values in our
dataset, the last thing we did to preprocess our data was
remove any outliers in our Spread column. To do this,
we used a common rule of thumb which is the 1.5*IQR
rule. This helped remove some bias in our model as it is
very uncommon for the spread of a game to be
something more than 35 points. This only removed
approximately 200 data points from our dataset,
therefore it won’ t have a significant impact on our
analysis.
Next, we generated a blend of scatterplots based on the
remaining features in order to do an initial visual
evaluation of how the covariates relate to game spread.
Most variables don’ t have a linear relationship when
compared individually with the spread, which is why
we aimed to develop a neural network that can capture
nonlinearities and interactions in the data that other
machine learning models would not be able to.
However , the QB Rating is one variable where a
reasonable positive linear relationship can be seen
individually with Spread, as shown in the scatterplots to
the left. We can see that the better a QB of a specific
team performs, the spread tends to favor that team.
4
Observing this, we performed a simple linear regression to predict the Spread based on how each teams’  QB
performed, while including the home/away variable to normalize the comparison.
4. Baseline Ordinary Least Squares Model
To generally view the linear relationship between dif ferent stats of match and the score spread, we build a
simple linear regression model. The summary of the baseline model is shown as below .

The ordinary least square linear regression model estimates showed us that the team quarterback rating has a
strong positive linear relationship with the score dif ference and the home feature seems not that important. This
simple model suggests that with a standard deviation increase in QB performance, it can translate to
approximately 7 game points (equivalent of a touchdown and extra point), while explaining approximately 61%
of the variance in spread. This model is by no means a strong predictor of spread, however it helped us gain a
stronger understanding about the relationships in our data going forward. We also notice that the OLS linear
regression model did not capture a strong linear relationship with Temperature and Pass1stD with Spread. We
think that there are more of our features that we can not perfectly capture their relation to the score dif ferences
simply by linear regression estimates. Therefore, we decided to develop an N-N model to have more accurate
predictions since it can capture the non-linear relationships and interactions in the data.
5. Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network Model
Since our prediction is a regression problem and our data points are all numerical values, the Multi-layer
Perceptron regressor was a good choice and the sci-kit learn package meets the requirements we need to
develop this. We definitely experienced a tough time at first when trying to find the best hyperparameter for our
Neural network model, which included the activation function, hidden layer size, number of neurons, and
number of epochs.5
5.1 Feature Selection
At first, we had 34 features as input for a MLP  regressor model using relu as activation function , but
unfortunately the performance was bad. Even though the training error and test error was low , the real
prediction for 2022 Super Bowl Prediction, as well as our validation set predictions, were not even close. We
collected the features of the 2022 Super Bowl match and the prediction value varied a lot with even negative
spreads which is completely opposite to the real result: Los Angeles Rams defeated the Cincinnati Bengals in
Super Bowl 2022 with the score 23-20. Our model at this phase was not robust at all, we kept getting results
like +80. +120, -34, -6 which vary from the actual +3 a lot. Before tuning hyperparameters, we did feature
selection first to improve the performance. We subtracted “Tm” stats from “Opp” stats and created a new set of
features. This brought us down to 16 features.
With
this reduction in features the prediction was a little more
reasonable as the real predictions ranged from -5 to +60. Additionally , the testing error (MAE) also reduced
from 6 to 4, but it was still not robust enough, so we needed to tune dif ferent hyperparameters.
5.2 Hyperparameter Tuning

As you may have noticed, the sigmoid activation function is
better for our NFL  predictions and since we have around
10,000 data points, the hidden-layer size shouldn't be lar ge, to
avoid overfitting. Experiment 5 actually resulted in higher
errors compared to others with smaller hider layer size. We
also surprisingly found that 2
ⁿ
neurons in each hidden
layer
performs much better than other random numbers. After
trying out tons of hyperparameter , we finalized our
MLP-Regressor model with 4 hidden layers and a neuron size
combination of (32, 64, 64, 128); The maximum epochs (how
6
many times each data point will be use) of the model setting is 200 since the loss curves at right showed us the
training loss stopped decreasing around 80 epochs because the validation loss started to increase at that
iteration. The validation data was set to 20% of the training data.
5.3 Test Robustness
To test the robustness of our MLP  model, we tried dif ferent initial values of weight and bias by changing
the parameter of “random_state” in scikit-learn MLP  regressor package.

After trying out dif ferent initial values of weight and bias we can conclude that our model is robust since
the training error , test error , and prediction for the super bowl this year did not have lar ge variance. In the real
world, our averaged prediction among these 10 dif ferent initializations is 4.437 which is very close to the real
value 3. It is also surprising that the prediction on real games is extremely accurate when we choose
initialization from a (400-1000).
5.4 Permutation Importance
With this final model, we started to inspect the
importance of all features by performing a
permutation importance analysis on this Neural-Net
Model. This analysis measures the decrease in model
performance when shuf fling an individual column.
The greater loss in model performance means the
feature is more important. This randomly shuf fled
procedure breaks the relationship between the feature
and the predicted value, therefore the drop in
performance is indicative of how much the model
depends on the feature. According to our permutation
graph, RushTD , QBRating, and PassTD are the three
most important features. It also agrees with what OLS
7
linear regression estimates’  results that Temperature, Pass1stD, etc has little explanation of Spread. We should
always keep in mind that permutation importances does not reflect the intrinsic predictive value of a feature by
itself but how important this feature is for this particular MLP  regressor model. Although we have shown that
this model performs extremely well, we still want to do further research like correcting the statistical inference
on the relationship between the selected features and the game spread.
6. Post Prediction Inference Correction
The permutation graph shows us the relative importance for the prediction model of each covariate in
predicting the game spread, and we must apply postpi to every single feature in order to see what degree (if any)
postpi will assist in correcting statistical inference. Will it provide lar ge corrections for our two most important
features (QBRating and RushTD)? Perhaps only the weaker features like 1stD or Sk will benefit from postpi?
There’ s even the chance that no features will derive a benefit from postpi, due to any number of reasons. These
questions guided our analysis in our quest to revolutionize sports analysis.
6.1 Post Prediction Inference Definition
With a successful and suf ficient prediction model now completed, it was time to begin the main focus of
our methodology of postpi, but first some background as to what postpi actually is. Post-prediction inference is
a method for providing corrected statistical inference by correcting model bias and improving variance
estimations. Statistical inference (and the reliability of the inference) refers to
the theory , methods,
and practice
of forming judgments about the parameters of a population and the reliability of statistical relationships,
typically on the basis of random sampling.
An example
to understand this in the concept of NFL  sports analysis
is a hypothetical inference based on the importance of the home-field advantage. A sports analyst takes a
random sample of NFL  games and finds statistically significant results that a team playing on its home turf has
around a 10-15% higher chance of winning. Because of the analyst’ s strong findings, they can provide reliable
statistical inference across all NFL  games (future or otherwise) that a team playing on their home turf has
around a 10-15% higher chance of winning. Another important aspect of postpi is model bias, and it refers to
the dif ference between average prediction and the correct observation the model is attempting to predict, high
bias is due to an under -fitted prediction model and leads to high training/testing error . Variance estimation
relates to a model’ s ability to predict on testing and unseen data, high variance is due to over -fitting on training
data and leads to high test error .
6.2 Post Prediction Inference Method
With some background knowledge about postpi, it’ s time to dive into its actual steps and
implementation. The first two steps are splitting the available data into train, test, and validation sets. A critical
assumption of postpi is that the training and testing sets are complete and provided with both covariates and the
observed outcome, while the validation set will solely contain covariates and no observed outcomes. The
reasoning behind this distinction sources from another assumption of postpi, that it’ s used in the context that8
acquiring true observations for all (or perhaps any) of the available data would be infeasible. As such, the
inference model must be prepared for downstream applications in which there are literally no observed
outcomes collected for any of the covariates. NFL  season matchups are prepared long in advance with each
teams’  stats widely known, it’ s impossible to collect the observations for future datasets unless you wait until
the game has passed, and thus our subject of interest meets this postpi assumption well. After the datasets are
properly set up, we fit our MLP  NN prediction model on the training sets
X
i
covariates (ranging from
quarterback rating to penalty yards) and
y
i
, observed
game-spread outcomes, to extract a relationship between
the covariates and their outcomes. The assumptions of postpi don’ t specify what type of machine learning
model/algorithm can and can’ t be used as the prediction model, and to the contrary one of the greatest attributes
of postpi is that it excels easily with nearly any model from regression to potentially million parameter
algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors and Neural Networks. Once the prediction model is properly trained
and ready for utilization, we use the testing set’ s
X
i
covariates to generate a set of predicted outcomes
y
p i
equal
in size to the test’ s observed outcomes set.
The critical inquiry that postpi is designed to address is how to reduce incorrect model bias and variance
so that downstream statistical inference provides more accurate results. Attempting to accomplish this by
directly editing the prediction model itself is more achievable when using a simple regression model, but doing
so on a high level model like our Neural Network would be nearly impossible. Postpi is useful because it
doesn’ t operate on the prediction model, an essential part of its inference correction is based on a
low-dimensional relationship model (in our case linear regression) generated between the testing set’ s observed
and predicted outcomes. In the validation set, the prediction model generates a set of predicted outcomes
y
p i
on
the validation set’ s covariate sample. A refined set of validation outcomes with reduced bias and better variance
estimation is produced by plugging the predicted outcomes into the relationship model to reverse engineer
“observed outcomes”, or basically predicted outcomes that are much more similar to what actual true outcomes
would look like. A potential limitation of postpi is that a critical factor in its successful implementation depends
on the caliber of the relationship model between the testing tests
y
i
observed outcomes and
y
p i
predicted
outcomes, yet this wasn’ t an issue with our data.
The relationship model provides a solid means of inference correction, but another and more advanced
method of correction is the bootstrap based approach, and in our code the bootstrap function runs 100 times for
each postpi iteration. This approach takes place after the relationship model has been implemented, and then the
relationship model, the validation data featuring only the covariate of interest, and the uncorrected predicted
outcomes, are passed into the bootstrap function. Random sample with replacement is taken from the validation
data (covariate and predictions) equal in size to the validation data. Corrected predictions are generated using
the relationship model and we produce an OLS regression model as our inference model. From this inference
model, we extract the beta estimate, the standard error of the beta estimate, t-statistic, and the p-value. For9
parametric bootstrap we return to the postpi function the median of the 100 beta estimates, the median of the
100 beta estimate standard errors, and the median of the p-value of the beta estimators. In the case of
non-parametric bootstrap, the median of the beta estimates and the median of the p-values are also returned,
however the standard error is calculated as the standard deviation of the 100 beta estimate standard errors. The
t-statistic is calculated back in the postpi function by dividing the aggregated beta estimate with the standard
error , and the final values for parametric and non-parametric bootstrap-based corrected beta estimates, standard
errors, p-values, and t-statistics, are all appended to respective lists at the conclusion of each iteration of postpi.
6.3 Post Prediction Inference Application
Our findings illustrate
this process and describe
our conclusions. In our
data we ran postpi 1,000
times on each of our
features separately as the
covariate of interest, and
chose to highlight our
results using the feature
(QBRating) that most
strongly emphasized the results we found across the board from all covariates in our dataset.
In the figure above, the left plot shows QBRating versus the observed game spread, and the plot to the
right shows QBRating versus the predicted game spread. Something that instantly strikes out is how the
predicted outcomes have lower variance and hug closer to the red line when compared to the observed
outcomes. Another point of interest is that the predicted graph’ s overall shape and linear angle is highly similar
to the observed outcomes’  graph. The following figures are based on the test set’ s data.
Both graphs above
display the
relationship between
the test set’ s observed
and predicted
outcomes, with the
graph on the left
featuring the
predictions from our
MLP  Neural Network model, and the graph on the right displaying the predictions from our linear regression
1 0
baseline model. We previously mentioned that the ability to easily model the relationship between predicted and
observed outcomes despite the complexity of the prediction model was an essential component of postpi, and
we can see that both our neural network and linear regression
highlight a strong linear relationship between their respective
observed and predicted outcomes. Another striking detail is that our
prediction model has a far stronger relationship between the
observed and predicted values than the baseline model does, simply
due to the nature of the models themselves. Having concluded that a
simple relationship model between the observed and predicted
outcomes can be established from our Neural Network, we can
derive that the grounds for inference correction via the relationship
model is plausible and move on to bootstrap-based correction.
The graphs to the left are based on the validation set’ s data. There are
three potential labels as can be seen in all of these graphs,
non-parametric, parametric, and no correction, with each graph
containing 1,000 data points for each label corresponding to the
number of postpi iterations we ran. The two former have been earlier
explained as the two types of bootstrap-based correction, but no
correction is the control sample of predicted outcomes which
received no correction (via bootstrap nor the relationship model), and
serves to let us observe how the inference model fitted on predictions
directly from our MLP  Neural Network contrast to the inference
models rendered via postpi’ s bootstrap based correction. No
correction on the top plot is consistently lower than either the
non-parametric or parametric bootstrap, with the latter two seeming
to show nearly identical results, however they all share a very strong
linear relationship. On the Standard Error plot, non-parametric
standard error is all over the place, parametric is almost perfectly on
the line, and no correction is now only slightly lower than the line
and the values are much tighter . Again as with the beta estimates, no
correction displays a strong linear relationship and consistent slope.
Here’ s where the findings become quite clear , on the “T -Statistics”
graph because the parametric and no correction t-statistics are both
perfectly on the line with no major dif ferences, again the
1 1
non-parametric values are more widely distributed. On the “P-V alues” figure below , all three labels feature a
p-value of approximately zero, as this is less than 0.05 we can reject the null hypothesis that the respective
inference model does not accurately capture the relationship between the covariate of interest (QBRating) and
the predicted outcome (game spread), and decisively conclude that each of the inference models for no
correction, non-parametric bootstrap, and parametric bootstrap all
reliably represent that relationship. The “P-V alues” graph for all of
the other features as well looked identical or very similar to this one,
and as such they provide a clear answer to the question “to what
degree, if any , will postpi provide statistical inference correction for
our NFL  sports analysis?” The answer to that being “not much”,
apparently . While the exact reasoning as to why postpi didn’ t help
out much here can’ t be confidently stated, we can speculate that the
very high accuracy of our MLP  Neural Network prediction model
effectively expressed the link between each of our covariates and the
game spread outcome.
7. Conclusion
In conclusion, our project followed all the steps of a data science project. We began with collecting our NFL
game data and compiled a final dataset by using all the dif ferent smaller datasets we collected. Then, we
conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships between variables in our data, and dealt with
common pre-processing steps such as missing values and outliers. Once we had a strong understanding of our
cleaned dataset, we built a simple linear regression model as a baseline to improve on to gain some
understanding on how our covariates impact our response variable, Spread. Once we saw that our baseline
model is not capturing all the relationships in our data, we developed a neural network model that performed
much better than our baseline model. With this model we were able to achieve a near perfect prediction on
Superbowl L VI, and an average error of 4 points, nearly half of our initial baseline model. We then set out to
understand the importance of each of our features so that we can apply our research of post-prediction inference
to better correct our inference on these variables. After using the method of postpi, we find that our neural
network model results in a very accurate representation of our covariates and therefore statistical inference
correction is not necessary in this case. Our post-prediction inference methods helped confirm that our model is
quite accurate in inferring the relationship for each of our features that is used to determine the outcome of an
NFL game.
","The project focused on applying post-prediction inference (postpi) to sports analysis, specifically NFL games. The team designed a model to predict game outcomes and analyzed the factors that determine the margin of victory. They collected NFL data from various sources and performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. They built a baseline linear regression model and a neural network model for prediction. They then applied postpi to correct statistical inference and assess the importance of each feature. The results showed that the neural network model performed well and did not require significant correction through postpi."

Abstract
Topic modeling allows us to fulfill algorithmic needs to organize, understand, and annotate
documents according to the discovered structure. Given the vast troves of data and the lack
of specialized skillsets, it is helpful to extract topics in an unsupervised manner using Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). LDA is a generative probabilistic topic model for discrete data,
but unfortunately, solving for the posterior distribution of LDA is intractable, given the
numerous latent variables that have cross dependencies. It is widely acknowledged that
inference methods such Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Variational Inference are a good
way forward to achieve suitable approximate solutions for LDA. In this report, we will
explore both these methods to solve the LDA problem on the Wikipedia corpus. We find
that better performance can be achieved via preprocessing the data to filter only certain
parts-of-speech via lemmatization, and also exclude extremely rare or common words. We
improved on the Expectations-Maximization (EM) Algorithm used for variational inference
by limiting the number of iterations in the E step even if sub-optimal. This leads to benefit
of faster runtimes and better convergences due to fewer iterations and avoidance of local
minima. Finally, we explore early stopping runtimes on under-parameterized LDA models
1to infer the true dimensionality of the Wikipedia vocabulary to solve for topics. While the
English language has around a million words, our findings are that it only takes around
fifteen thousand words to infer around twenty major topics in the dataset.
1. Introduction
As more data and information in the world becomes available, it not only provides the op-
portunity to learn, interact with, and apply that knowledge, but it makes it more difficult
to conveniently organize, understand, and extract usefulness out of this data. Thus, we
have algorithmic needs to help us with this kind of task involving data such as massive
collections of electronic text. Specifically, topic modeling provides us with methods for au-
tomatically organizing, understanding, and summarizing these large collections of text data
without actually having to read through every document of these massive text archives.
Topic modeling allows us to discover the hidden thematic structure in data, such as text
data, to annotate documents according to the discovered structure. We can then use these
annotations to organize, summarize, and search the documents. One particular topic model
is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
The intuition behind LDA is the assumption that documents exhibit multiple topics, as
opposed to the assumption that documents exhibit a single topic. We can elaborate on
this by describing the imaginary generative probabilistic process that we assume our data
came from. LDA first assumes that each topic is a distribution over terms in a fixed size
vocabulary. LDA then assumes documents are generated as follows:
1. A distribution over topics is chosen, for each document
2. For each word in a document, a topic from the distribution over topics is chosen
3. A word is drawn from a distribution over terms associated with the topic chosen in
the previous step.
2In other words, a document might have high associations with topics x,yandz. For a
particular word, We might choose a topic xto be expressed. Based on this topic xwe
choose a word from the distribution over terms associated with topic x. This is repeated
for every word in a document and is how our document is generated. We repeat this for the
next document in our collection, and thus a new distribution over topics is chosen and its
words are chosen in the same process. It is important to note that the topics across each
document remain the same, but the distribution of topics and how much each document
exhibits the topics changes. Another important observation to point out is that this model
has a bag-of-words assumption, in other words, the order of the words doesn’t matter. The
generative process isn’t meant to retain coherence, but it will generate documents with
different subject matter and topics.
Now that we have explained the generative process, we can reiterate the statistical prob-
lem that is we cannot observe the hidden structure, we only assume it exists. Thus, we
want to solve this problem by inferring all of the values of the hidden variables: the topic
proportions associated with each document, the topics associated with each word, and the
distribution over terms that forms the documents in a collection.
LDA as a graphical model (in figure 1) allows us to describe the generative process as
well as define a factorization of the joint probability of all of the hidden and observed ran-
dom variables. It can help us infer the hidden variables given the observations by writing
down the algorithms that can solve this problem. The only variable that we observe is
the words in every document, represented by Wd,n, and therefore, its circle is shaded. The
other variables are latent variables and not shaded. The boxes represent multiplicity since
there are D documents, K topics, and N words in every document, and correspondingly the
number of variables and thus multiplied.
The joint probability defines a posterior in which we want to infer from a collection of
3documents, the topic assignments for each word zd,n, the topic proportions for each docu-
ment θd, and the topic distributions for each corpus βk. We can then use those posterior
inferences to perform varying tasks. In summary, the hidden structure is uncovered by
computing the posterior, and then the uncovered structure can be used to perform tasks.
This is done by using all the hidden variables that we assume existed in the collections of
data and discovered through the posterior distribution.
Figure 1: Graphical model of LDA
Building off our work from Q1, we find that solving the LDA posterior directly is in-
tractable due to the dependence between the latent parameters from the two pathways of
topics and topic assignments to the observed variable. Fortunately, we have options for ap-
proximate inference techniques such as variational inference (VI) and Monte Carlo Markov
Chains (MCMC), and we will explore both of these in this report.
1.1 Probability distributions of LDA model
This section will go into further detail about the probability distributions governing the
LDA model. From Figure 1, we can see αon the far left and ηon the far right. Both of
these are hyperparameters of the Dirichlet distribution, from which we draw θdfor the topic
proportions and βkfor the terms in topics respectively.
4These parameters should be smaller than 1, as they are concentration parameters. When
they are larger than 1, the distribution becomes focused in the middle, which means that
the chances are that every topic will be meaningful in a document for α, or every term is
meaningful for a given topic for η. In practice, we know that only a section of topics or
words are meaningful, and so we use α= 0.1 and η= 0.01.
The name of this topic model, Latent Dirichlet Distribution, probably comes from the
fact that the Dirichlet distribution plays such an important role, and that it is latent and
not observed directly.
The Dirichlet distributions are conjugate priors to the multinomial distribution, meaning
that we draw samples from the two Dirichlet distributions to get θdfor the topic proportions
andβkfor the terms in topics respectively. We then first draw Zd,nfor every word in the
document from the multinomial distribution parameterized by θdto get one exact topic
out of the K topics for every word. Conditioning on this topic, we draw from the relevant
multinomial distribution parameterized by the βkmatching the topic Zd,n, to get the exact
word or term that is popular with the same topic.
52. Methods
2.1 Data Collection
2.1.1 Previous work
Figure 2: Retooling existing paradigm
We explored existing work done by Sam Patterson and Yee Whye Teh, who have kindly
published their code on their webpage. Their existing code is in Python 2 and the structure
of the library is laid out in the figure above.
Data is in the form of Wikipedia Articles, which are downloaded on the fly from the web
as needed by processwiki. Since data is not saved for future runs, and due to rate-limiting
throttling from Wikipedia.com, it takes a while to run. Due to the randomness of generat-
ing data, exact experiments cannot be replicated. The original authors suggested that the
code could be modified in the future to download many articles via threads and to cache
the data, but this was not yet implemented.
2.1.2 Our implementation
6Figure 3: Current paradigm
Our implementation will be to create a standalone program, wikidownloader that would
download articles from Wikipedia in the background, and saved them as compressed pickle
files. We will be using the latest libraries in python 3 as best practice, and also updated
the code to reflect the latest URLs and HTML tags that have evolved over the years.
7Figure 4: An example of a Wikipedia article
An example of a Wikipedia article is shown in the figure above. Several decisions have
to be made in data collection. For example, do we collect text data from tables and graphs?
Do we collect data from the ”References” section?
Figure 5: An example of a Wikipedia article post-script
8Finally, the postscript of the article provides hints of the topic under description. We
believe it would be a pitfall to capture that since it tells us that topic, which in this case
might be British Army and English cricket. Therefore, we only capture the main text on
the Wikipedia page, and we above the references, external links, or footnotes.
2.2 Data Preprocessing
2.2.1 Tokenization
Our first step in preprocessing is tokenization. Tokenization is the process of taking the
article text as a string, converting to lowercase, removing punctuation and other non-
alphabets, and splitting the remaining text into a list of words. These words can then be
assigned an integer ID so that the corpus can be transformed into a sparse matrix of word
counts. An example of the tokenization process is in the figure below.
Figure 6: An example of the tokenizaton process
2.2.2 N-grams
N-grams are N consecutive tokens in the text. Tokens are basically unigrams while bi-grams
are two consecutive words. N-grams are useful when two words frequently occur together,
such as ”New York”, and we merged them into a single entity as they are only meaningful
9together. We use the Spacy library and its linguistic model to form meaningful bigrams.
For example, in this article about geology, only the terms ’family’ and ’gelechiidae’ are
merged into a bigram ’family gelechiidae’ since they are linked together and improves the
meaning of the bags of N-grams as the geological ”family” is now distinguished from the
more common use of the word ”family”.
Figure 7: An example of Bi-Gram
2.2.3 Lemmatization
Lemmatization is a process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word. The first
step is to apply a language model to tag each word into a part-of-speech (PoS). We can
then assign the base form for each word. For example, the lemma of “was” is “be”, and the
lemma of “plays” is “play”.
We use the python spacy library for Lemmatization. It supports more than 64 languages,
and so it allows us to extend our analysis to articles in other languages in the future. It
follows the Universal Part-of-Speech (UPoS) tagset (Petrov et al., 2012), and lists the fol-
lowing 17 categories: adjective(ADJ), adposition (ADP), adverb (ADV), auxiliary (AUX),
coordinating conjunction (CCONJ), determiner (DET), interjection (INTJ), noun (N), nu-
merical (NUM), particle(PART), pronoun (PRON), proper noun (PROPN), punctuation
(PUNCT), subordinating conjunction (SCONJ), symbol (SYM), verb (VERB) and other
10(X).
With the tags, we can remove the parts of speech that do not give valuable information
about the article. For example, if we believe that verbs and adjectives are not informative,
we will avoid including words that are tagged as VERB or ADJ.
In a preliminary run with a corpus of 50k articles, we obtained a log perplexity score
of -15.2 with n-gram tokens, but a better log perplexity score of -14.0 with lemmatization.
2.3 Performance Measures of LDA models
Recall that LDA is an unsupervised learning model, and there are no target labels to match.
This means that typical comparisons between actual and desired outputs cannot be done,
along with loss ratios and other measures. Instead, our measure of goodness on an output
would have to be based on likelihood measures on unseen data to test our approximate
inferred posterior distributions. This is related to the concept of entropy as explained in
the subsections below. Since the likelihood becomes exponentially small as the number of
words increases, it is customary to normalize it to a per-word likelihood in measures such
as perplexity.
2.3.1 Entropy
Information entropy measures the average level of unpredictability inherent in a random
variable. For example, a biased coin that always lands on heads (or a trick coin that only
has heads) has an entropy of 0, since it is very predictable. On the other hand, a fair coin
that has a 50-50 split between heads and tails will have an entropy of 1, and would have
the highest entropy of all coins including the biased ones.
Formally, entropy (H(X)) of random variable X is:
11H(X) =E[−log(p(X))]
and for a discrete domain:
H(X) =−Pp(xi)log(p(xi))
The plot of entropies of a coin with various biases is shown in the figure below.
Figure 8: Plot of entropy of a coin with different biases
2.3.2 Cross-entropy
Often, we do not actually know the target probability distribution p(X), and we approximate
it with another probability distribution q(X). When this occurs, it is helpful to define cross-
entropy as a distance measure between the two distributions.
H(p, q) =Ep(X)[−log(q(X))]
For a discrete domain:
H(p, q) =−Pp(xi)log[q(xi)]
12Note that the sum is maximized when p(xi) matches q(xi) for every xi. Taking into account
the negative sign, therefore, the cross-entropy H(p,q) is minimized when p=q. In that case,
H(p,q) becomes the entropy H(p).
2.3.3 Kullback -Leibler divergence
The posterior distribution is usually denoted by p(θ|x) while the variational posterior is
denoted by q(θ|x). The variational posterior q(θ|x) is the closest member within the varia-
tional approximate family Q to the target posterior p(θ|x). That is, q∈Q.
To define this ”closeness”, the Kullback–Leibler divergence ( DKL) is used to measure the
distance between these two probability distributions. It is often used interchangeably as a
likelihood measure. DKLis also known as relative entropy and is defined by the following
integral:
DKL(q(θ)|p(θ|x)) =∞Z
−∞q(θ|x)log(q(θ|x)
p(θ|x))dθ (1)
In expectations notation, this is equivalent to
DKL(q(θ)|p(θ|x)) =Eq(log(q(θ))−Eq(log(p(θ|x))) (2)
Then the best candidate q(θ|x) would be:
q(θ|x) =argmin θEq(log(q(θ|x))−Eq(log(p(θ|x))) (3)
To avoid having to calculate p(θ|x), using Bayes’ rule, note
13DKL(q(θ)|p(θ|x)) =Eq(log(q(θ)−log(p(x, θ)) +log(p(x)) (4)
Defining Evidence Lower Bound or ELBO(q) as:
ELBO (q) =L(q) =−Eq(log(q(θ)−log(p(x, θ))) (5)
We get the following relationship between KL and ELBO:
DKL(q(θ)|p(θ|x)) =−ELBO (q) +log(p(x)) (6)
log(p(x)) =DKL(q(θ)|p(θ|x)) +ELBO (q) (7)
Therefore, instead of minimizing DKL(q(θ)|p(θ|x)), we can equivalently maximize ELBO(q),
since they both sum to a constant.
Note that ELBO has two terms. The first term is just the entropy of q, while the sec-
ond term is related to the cross entropy between p and q.
ELBO (q) =H(q)−H(q, p) (8)
2.4 Perplexity of a LDA model
Perplexity is related tightly related to ELBO, with two main differences. (1) It flips the
sign such that the desired level is a minimum rather than maximum. (2) It calculates the
measure on a per-word level, rather than on the entire document, therefore normalizing ex-
tremely small likelihoods due to compounding imposed on longer documents versus shorter
documents.
14According to Hofmann [12], perplexity refers to the log-averaged inverse probability on
unseen data. The perplexity of our LDA model can be defined as the exponential of the
cross-entropy between ˜ pandq. That is,
perplexity =eH(˜p,q)=e−P˜p(x)log(q(x))(9)
Note that since we don’t know p, we use ˜ pinstead, which is the empirical distribution of
samples drawn from the true distribution p.
Assuming there are N sample tokens drawn, the formula simplifies to,
perplexity =eP
x∈˜p(log(q(x))−1)/N(10)
which explains why Hoffman calls it the ”log-averaged inverse probability”.
Cancelling the log with the exponential, we see that the equation is equivalent to the
geometric mean of the inverse token probabilities. This is another popular form of the
definition of perplexity but the two forms are mathematically equivalent.
perplexity =NsY
x∈˜p(1/log(q(x)) (11)
Since this is a measure on token probabilities, a longer or shorter sentence in the unseen
test set will not affect the measure.
15In practice, we optimize our variational inference model using KL divergences, but we
report perplexity as an afterthought by dividing the log probabilities by the number of
words and then using it as the negative exponent:
perplexity = 2−ELBO Perword (q)(12)
Figure 9: Exponent of perplexity is -ELBO per word

172.5 LDA implementation with Gibbs sampling
In Q1 we explored MCMC methods, specifically the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, to solve
the problem of computing high-dimensional integrals. We learned that this particular class
of sampling methods was especially effective in performing probabilistic inferences which
can be applied to solve problems specifically within the field of Bayesian inference and
learning. We applied this particular MCMC method for sampling posterior distributions,
since the posterior probability distribution for parameters given our observations proved to
be intractable, hence the use of sampling algorithms for approximate inference.
LDA is similar in that its aim is to infer the hidden structure of documents through posterior
inference. Since we cannot exactly compute the conditional distribution of the hidden vari-
ables given our observations, we can use MCMC methods to approximate this intractable
posterior distribution. Specifically, we can use Gibbs sampling to implement LDA. Gibbs
sampling is another MCMC method that approximates intractable probability distributions
by consecutively sampling from the joint conditional distribution:
P(W, Z, ϕ, θ |α, β).
This models the joint distribution of topic mixtures θ, topic assignments Z, the words of a
corpus W, and the topics ϕ. In the approach we use, we leverage the collapsed Gibbs sam-
pling method in not representing ϕorθas parameters to be estimated, and only considering
the posterior distribution over the word topic assignments P(Z|W). By using Dirichlet pri-
ors on ϕandθ, this means αandβare conjugate to the distributions ϕandθ. This allows
us to compute the joint distribution by integrating out the multinomial distributions ϕand
θ:
P(Z|W, α, β ).
Then because Wis observed we only need to sample each zm,n, that is, the topic assign-
ment for the n’th word in the m’th document, given all other topic assignments and the
18observations, not including the current topic assignment.
P(zm,n|Z¬m,n, W, α, β )
This conditional distribution is required to construct a Markov chain by sampling the next
state based on the current state, this MCMC approach is known to converge to the target
distribution, or in our case the posterior. Each state is an assignment of values to the
variables being sampled, in our case the topic assignment z, and the next state is achieved
by sampling all variables from their distribution conditioned on the current values of all
other variables and the observations. Thus, we obtain a conditional distribution where for
a single word win document dthat is assigned topic k, the conditional distribution becomes
the sum of two ratios.
P(zm,n=k|Z¬m,nW, α, β )∝σ¬m,n
m,k+αkPK
i=1σ¬m,n
m,i +αi∗δ¬m,n
k,wm,n+βwm,nPV
r=1δ¬m,n
k,r+βr
The first term being the ratio of word win topic k, multiplied by the second term which
equals the ratio of topic kin document d. The product is a vector which assigns a weight
to each topic k, and it’s normalization is the probability of the topic assignment of the next
state based on the current state. For our context, the next state is the assignment of the
current word to a topic k. For example, a word wwith a high ratio in topic kand a topic
kwith a high ratio in document dis indicative that the topic assignment kfor that word
wis more likely for that word win document d.In order to compute this full conditional
distribution we keep tack of these statistics as we sweep through all the documents in a
collection. And our estimated of ϕandθcan be implemented and calculated with the
following:
θj,k≈σj,k+αkPK
i=1σj,i+αi
ϕk,v≈δk,v+βvPV
r=1δk,r+βr
19Where σj,kis the number of times we see topic kin document j, and δk,vis the number of
times topic khas been chosen for word type v. This is how we derive the final estimates for
θandϕ, and we set implement this algorithmically to compare MCMC sampling methods
against other inference methods.
2.6 LDA implementation with Mean-Field Variational Inference
We ran some baseline tests using the Gensim python library initially but later reverted
to the original onlineldavb.py package of functions for fitting LDA with online variational
Bayes by Matthew D. Hoffman [13] so as to better understand and control the algorithm.
To fit LDA, the variational family chosen is a Mean-field Variational family that other-
wise mirrors the distributions of the posterior. Recall that the posterior is intractable due
to the dependence between variables arising from the two pathways of topic proportions and
term proportions to get to the actual word, as shown in figure 1. Mean-field Variational
Inference assumes that all the variables are independent so that the variational posterior
can be fully factored. Namely, the variational family from which we fit q assumes that β,
θ,zare independent and can be fully factored, such that:
q(βk, θ, z) =Y
kq(βk)Y
dq(θd)Y
nq(zdn) (13)
To find the best q within this family to fit the posterior p, we introduce variational parame-
ters that we tweak as we attempt to maximize the likelihood of the model to the Wikipedia
corpus.
The variational parameter for topic assignments is ϕ.
q(zdi=k) =Multinomial (ϕdwk) (14)
20The variational parameter for topic proportions is γ.
q(θd) =Dirichlet (θd;γd) (15)
The variational parameter for topics is λ.
q(βk) =Dirichlet (βk;λk) (16)
Note that probability distributions of two Dirichlet and one Multinomial have not changed
from the original posterior p. Note that the posterior p also has
zdi∼Multinomial (θ)
θd∼Dirichlet (α)
βk∼Dirichlet (η)
and these distributions are mirrored in q, but the big difference is the dependence of the
terms in p (such as between θandβ) has been broken.
21Figure 11: Graphical model of MFVI for LDA
The figure above shows the template for MFVI, where the arrows between variables are
now broken and do not show the dependence. Instead, the arrows we see are between the
variational parameters and the parameters. (The figure only illustrates for θand z, and but
the same is true for βthat is outside of this figure.)
From this template, Hoffman developed an Expectations Maximization (EM) algorithm,
which consists of E steps and a M steps. At each stage or sub-stage, due to our assumption
of independence, we solve for the best q(zdi),q(θd), or q(βk) while holding the other vari-
ables constant and assuming that they are correctly specified. The E step solves this for
topic proportion (left pathway in figure 1) by assuming that topics is correctly specified. It
does this by varying ϕandγto optimize q(zdi) and q(θd). The algorithm loops until no
further improvement is shown. Then, the M step solves for the topics (right pathway in
figure 1) by assuming that topic proportions are correctly specified. It does this by varying
λto optimize q(βk). The full algorithm is shown in the pseudo-code below.
22Figure 12: MFVI EM Algorithm for LDA
2.6.1 Our improvements to the MFVI algorithm
We make two tweaks to the MFVI algorithm as described above.
Firstly, we find it wasteful to repeat the E step indefinitely to find the perfect variational
parameters ϕandγunder the assumption that q(βk) is correctly specified because we know
that that assumption is certainly false at the start of the algorithm when λis assigned
randomly. The focus should be to process as many documents as possible for an online
algorithm and not be caught up with ”perfect as the enemy of good”. As the algorithm
converges upon many passes, we will expect that the E step will not require many iterations
anyway, as it will just be incremental changes at that point. Therefore, we changed the
code to take the maximum number of E step iterations as a parameter, so that we can vary
it from say 5 to 80. The results are shown in the results section of this write-up.
Secondly, we are motivated by Shen, Gao, and Ma [11] to find means to under-parameterize
the MFVI model so that we can run experiments on early stopping, and in doing so, get
hints about the true dimensionality of the underlying processes. This would answer the
key question as to how many critical words are really needed to distinguish topics from the
corpus, and bear light as to whether a human looking at the top 20 or 100 words can do
this effectively. We do this under-parameterization by keeping the structure of the algo-
rithm but no longer changing some of the λvariational parameters effectively fixing them
23at baseline probabilities. We remove variational parameters from the most popular words
first, as they are assumed to have the most commonality and hence less useful to distin-
guish topics. This parameterization removal does not change the size of the dataset nor the
likelihood calculations so we can do an apples-to-apples comparison across under and over
parameterized models. More details and results are available in the results section of this
write-up.
3. Results
3.1 Preprocessing Experiments
3.1.1 Minimal Preprocessing - Tokenization and N-grams
With minimal preprocessing, we remove punctuation and tokenize every article into uni-
grams and bigrams. There are 504 thousand words in the dictionary for which we count
unigrams and bigrams frequencies. The large sparse matrix takes considerable time to run.
In the figure below, we show the evolution of the likelihood and perplexity scores over the
first 40 minutes of runtime on a machine with 4 CPU cores.
24Figure 13: Optimal K value for Wikipedia dataset
As evidenced above, the performance in terms of time (40 minutes) or convergence
(with perplexity stuck at around 420 units) is not very good due to a large number of latent
parameters and tokens.
253.1.2 Extensive Preprocessing - Lemmatization and Dictionary Compression
We also ran the same experiment with extensive preprocessing. In addition to the above,
We applied the lemmatization process with the spaCy library to infer the part-of-speech
using the Universal Part-of-Speech (UPoS) tagset as per Petrov et al., 2012. It lists the fol-
lowing 17 categories: adjective (ADJ), adposition (ADP), adverb (ADV), auxiliary (AUX),
coordinating conjunction (CCONJ), determiner (DET), interjection (INTJ), noun (N), nu-
merical (NUM), particle(PART), pronoun (PRON), proper noun (PROPN), punctuation
(PUNCT), subordinating conjunction (SCONJ), symbol (SYM), verb (VERB) and other
(X). Of these categories, we choose to only retain nouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives as
meaningful tokens for the purpose of inferring topics.
In addition, we dealt with a large number of rare yet uninformative tokens. We removed
tokens that only appear in less than 0.1% of all documents. This reduced the number of
tokens in the dictionary to 31 thousand.
The run time and convergence are both greatly improved. In the figure below, we show
the evolution of the likelihood and perplexity scores over the first 3 minutes of runtime on
a machine with 4 CPU cores. It is likely that convergence already occurred in around 2
minutes, as compared to 40 minutes in the prior example. In addition, we achieved a better
perplexity score of around 375 as opposed to around 420 in the previous experiment.

273.2 Optimal value of K for Wikipedia dataset
We ran the gensim algorithm on the lemmatized Wikipedia dataset using different values
of K to find the best number of topics as measured by the coherence score. Our finding is
that a value of around 25 topics is optimal.
Figure 15: Optimal K value for Wikipedia dataset
3.3 Improving on EM Algorithm via limiting E step iterations
As explained in the methodology section above, we modified the code to impose a maximum
number of iterations in the E-step so that the online algorithm can more quickly process
more documents in the Wikipedia corpus while not trying to overly achieve the perfect topic
proportions estimate when the topics matrix is itself a very crude estimate of reality.
We vary the maximum number of iterations between 5 and 80 as we find that, in prac-
tice, the number of iterations does not generally exceed 80 under the original conditions of
28breaking the loop upon no incremental changes to γ. As expected, as can be seen in figure
16 below, the running time until early stopping (as defined in the next section) is faster as
the maximum number of iterations is dropped to 5.
We are positively surprised that the computational performance is also proved for our
training set of 24 thousand documents, as measured by perplexity on the holdout set of 1
thousand documents at early stopping. The figure shows a higher ELBO when the number
of iterations is smaller, along with the error bars from multiple runs. We believe that this
is a positive change to the original algorithm as it balances the computation of the E step
with the M step more parsimoniously, and it prevents ELBO from getting stuck at a local
maxima while the topics matrix is still in infancy.

3.4 Optimal Early Stopping on Under and Over-Parametrization
Along the lines of Shen, Gao, and Ma [11], we explore optimal early stopping on under and
over-parametrization of our LDA model. According to Shen, Gao, and Ma, early stopping
is a simple and widely used method to prevent over-training neural networks, and they
29developed theoretical results to show that (1) optimal early stopping time increases with
sample sizes and (2) optimal early stopping time increases with model dimension when the
model is under-parameterized, and then decreases with model dimension when it is over-
parameterized.
While they focused on neural networks, we extend their findings with empirical results
from our MFVI algorithm for LDA. Similar to them, we define early stopping when moving
average performance on a validation set shows no improvement, with the caveat that we are
measuring performance using perplexity scores for our unsupervised learning model without
labeled data.
We find this research particularly exciting because it answers the question of the dimensions
of the underlying data. The LDA model has been largely specified by a black box, with
parameters governed by conjugate priors or hyperparameters, but it doesn’t answer the
human question of how many words are needed to master a unique topic. When viewing
the results of an LDA model, human behavior would be to look at the relative frequencies
of the top 20 words of each topic, but there is no requirement that the separation of topics
lies in the next 20, 200 or even 2000 words. The experiment on early stopping times will
enable us to answer the question as to how many words are needed to uniquely define and
master a topic, just like the widely held view that it takes a human 10,000 hours to master
a new skill (even if we feel good after 20 hours!)
We tried unsuccessfully to under-parameterize the model via trimming the Dirichlet distri-
bution or increasing its concentration to fewer topics per document. The general result was
an increase in early stopping time as parametrization increased until the original full model
is reached. We believe that this is because handicapping the model unnaturally just forces
early stopping as it finds a local minimum.
30We find success by the more natural imposition on the number of parameters that are
fit to discover the terms in topics, namely by reducing the number of variational parame-
tersλin our mean-field variational inference model. Note that we are not actually changing
the dataset, which is now fixed after the preprocessing steps, as doing so would make the
comparison over different datasets rather than different model parameterization. Instead,
we under-parameterized our model by removing the variational parameters of the more
common words (that are probably common across topics) to a baseline assumption.
Recall that we have already removed common or non-meaningful words (as defined by
lemmatization tags) from our corpus. We have also removed extremely rare words so that
topics are not learned from outliers. Along those lines, we found experimentally that the
crux of separation of topics lies in the less frequently used (and yet above a rarity thresh-
old) specialized words for each topic. These words should be included as parameters in
our model, but it is less useful to consider common words that are shared by several or all
topics. By sorting word frequencies on the corpus, we can vary the number of variational
parameters of terms in topics that we are inferring by setting the more common words to
baseline probabilities. This has the effect of setting our model to the desired dimension d
as measured over parameters for topic vocabulary. We then run experiments on various
model dimensions d and expect that the longest early stopping times will correspond to
p=d where p is the natural dimension or number of unique words required to separate the
K topics.
Our findings largely mirror the direction of Shen, Gao, and Ma in their neutral network
experiment. The results are presented in the figure below. Similar to Shen, Gao, and Ma,
we find better model outcomes (in our case measured by perplexity scores) for large model
sizes. In addition, we find that small model sizes that are under-informative parameteri-
zations and of low model capacity reach early stopping quickly. As we increase the model
size, the stopping time increases until a peak and thereafter decreases, where the longest
31times are measured to be at 10 thousand words for the 25 thousand document dataset,
and 17.5 thousand words for the 50 thousand document dataset. If we can infer similarly
from the prior work, where the peak is the underlying data dimension p equals the model
dimension d, it would mean that while the English Language has around 1 million words,
only around 15 thousand words are needed to distinguish the various topics on Wikipedia.
Indeed, most of the convergence in perplexity has already occurred at such model sizes, but
like prior work, a larger model beyond p is still helpful in incremental convergence as well
as in running times.

3.5 Results from Gibbs sampling
We also developed code from scratch to perform Gibbs sampling to estimate the posterior.
We obtain perplexity scores that are roughly similar to the scores from MFVI, showing
that both methods achieve comparable and relatively good performance. However, it took
38 minutes to run the code, as opposed to just 3-4 minutes for MFVI. It is expected that
33MFVI will have faster performance, and perhaps it is the better method in the world of
exponentially rising data sizes.

4. Discussion and Conclusions
4.1 Human interpretation of topics
The following word clouds generated below summarizes how a human can perceive the topic
based on the relative word probabilities that are higher for certain terms in the topic. For
34example, topic 0 below appears to be about music, topic 5 below is about education and
topic 6 below is about sports.
Figure 19: Music topic
Figure 20: Academia
35Figure 21: Sports
4.2 Machine interpretation of topics
While a human might see the topics and their corresponding terms above obvious ex-post,
it is not so obvious ex-ante. Our experiments on the optimum number of topics show that
the best number as measured by coherence scores to is about 25. It is not clear if a human
would choose this same number, and different people might choose to create more or fewer
topics based on their discretions.
In addition, our experiment with under and over parameterizations and early stopping
shows that around 15 thousand words are used to distinguish topics. This is far higher than
a human can process in a typical word cloud which usually has less than 50 words.
In fact, according to a recent psychology research paper [14], Divergent Association Tasks
was given to thousands of participants to name 10 nouns that are completely unrelated to
one another. Humans have varying degrees of creativity, and this serves as a creativity score
when the words are maximally semantically distant on average. However, most of us find it
36very hard to list the perfect 10 words. Based on this, it might not be easy for a human to
create the perfect 25 topics that an LDA model can. After the first few topics of say sports,
education, and music, how easy is it to list 22 more topics? Would ”biology” be a subtopic
of education or is it a new topic? Would ”poems” be similar to ”music”, or should we have
”literature” as another topic? If psychological experiments show a difficulty at 10 nouns,
we believe that it is better for a machine to learn the topics as it ensures maximum topic
separation and lowest perplexity scores.
4.3 Final thoughts
Based on our findings above, we believe that LDA is an attractive model for unsupervised
learning of topics from the Wikipedia corpus, and it is best for computers rather than
humans to perform this cognitively difficult task. Preprocessing is key for performance, and
lemmatization works better than raw tokens as the meaning behind the tokens is inferred
and cataloged. In addition, we would prefer a MFVI model as compared to a MCMC model
– both have similar outputs but the former has a much faster run time. As for the MFVI
model, we propose limiting the E steps of the algorithm as a means for optimizing the run
time performance, while not sacrificing or possibly even leading to better perplexity scores.

Introduction
With the growing ubiquity of microphones (due in large part to Alexa and Google Home), localizing sound sources is becoming a more relevant issue.
The paper [1] discusses two strategies to solve this issue: affine mapping (or linear transformation) and principal component analysis (PCA). PCAs and
affine mappings were conducted to determine and map the sound source. In addition to the previously mentioned methods, supervised machine
learning was also mentioned (though not executed) as another possible method.
This group proposes to develop a supervised machine learning method mentioned in the paper [1] and also address some of the issues with the
previous methods. This is namely the low robustness to missingness in PCAs and the need for good anchor points in affine mapping. What we found
was that the SVM and Neural Network models were able to replicate the performance of the previous methods whereas Random Forest could not.
And between SVM and Neural Net, the latter proved more generalizable to unseen data.
Problem
A playing speaker is placed on a desk in a room. With a set of microphone arrays placed around the room, its location can be roughly triangulated
given the resulting data collected by the arrays, processed using beamforming [1]. In our experiment, our 5 arrays each produce a 3D ""vector"" of
arrival that tells the direction from which the array perceived the signal. From here, the goal becomes to transform this data from  to 
There are several naive solutions here, but two stand out as particularly robust: PCA and linear mapping. PCA seems a natural fit; downsizing from 
 with no real interpretative significance on any particular variable. While surprisingly precise, PCA suffers from 2 large issues: PCA can't handle
missing values and the arrays' data output can be inconsistent, and the final result is couched in the fitted PCA space, which is extremely difficult to
map back to the real world.
Linear (or affine) mappings solve the issues of missing values and abstract spaces but still leave a little to be desired, since accuracy is then limited by
the fact that it still only maps linear functions when clearly the underlying dynamics of a room are likely nonlinear. This in addition to the fact that
they need to be very well calibrating on anchor points to work some things to be desired, so the aim then is to find models to address the problems
above while minimizing tradeoffs in accuracy or practicality.

relatively straight line. What paths we are expected is a rectangle on the right and a line on the left.
Affine Mapping Plot (the baseline)
The baseline method for mapping sound source is an affine mapping [1]. Explained more deeply in the paper “Audio scene monitoring using
redundant ad-hoc microphone array networks“, affine mapping is essentially a linear transformation of the values in the DoA matrix into real-world
coordinates. The paths generated by these calculations are what we want to represent in our machine learning models.

Feedforward Neural Network
Neural Networks work best by processing large datasets in ways similar to a human mind, but in ways the brain does not work. In the case of
localizing sound source, this comes with processing data inputs of 15x3 shaped sound arrays. The gist of the neural network structure is a list of
inputs is multiplied by a list of weights (which are determined after training) and then goes through a net input function to aggregate the points.
Finally, the remaining data goes through an activation function which finally returns the output. This feedforward neural network is the classic neural
network architecture. The input shape is 15x3 while the output (in this use-case) is a 2-D coordinate. The hidden size is 20 and the number of epochs
is 2.

Support Vector Machine
SVM is a supervised learning algorithm that creates “decision boundaries” with regard to the values of the input data. While an SVM is known for
being a classification algorithm, it is also capable of regression and can work with this sort of problem. W e can see SVM works well at finding the
general path of the sound; this can be attributed to SVM’s resilience with small training datasets. However, the model does not perform as well at
finding sound that is far from the training points: the long-table sound data is very far off where it should be.

Linear Regression compared with Random Forest and Decision Tree
Random Forest is another supervised learning algorithm that determines output values through a decision tree. Like decision trees, random forests
are an ensemble method through a number of decisions. The difference between a random forest and a decision tree, however, is that random forest
allows for significantly more granular decisions. T rees in general, though, have a tendency to overfit to their training datasets and - unlike the previous
methods - produce irregular patterns, as we will see later.

Random Forest Plot on its own
Here we can see both the Random Forest's limitations by the data it is fed. As with our previous models, this random forest regressor was trained on
the training points from the toy dataset. Because the training data really only consists of 4 points on the L-shaped table, the model has trouble with
sound data originating from elsewhere in the room. Here the model is also plotting data from the long table which is labeled with green, and we can
clearly see it incorrectly places the sound on the L-shaped table.

Data Collection
As shown, many of our predictions struggled with drawing straight lines with the continuous data. W e decided we wanted to see how the models
would perform on a different dataset. In our experiment we recorded from a different room and used 12 points on a singular table instead of 8 across
table and chair points. W e also used 3 microphone arrays as two of the arrays failed during recording. W e opted to look into how using fewer arrays
would affect the models in not just the new data, but also the previously collected data.
Model with shape of 9
Because the format of our data was slightly different, we decided to re-run the model with a shape of 9x3 instead of 15x3  previously used. This
reflect the 3 pis used to record instead of the 5 in the office room. Each pi record three values , , and  which are the direction values to figure out
the location of sound. This is why our model from here on out have an input shape of 9.xy z

Discussion and Conclusion
We conclude that - to varying degrees - machine learning methods work well not only at localizing sound but also are resilient to array dropping. This
is joined by the fact that the models can translate directly into real world space unlike the PCA models from the original paper [1] and our proposal
[3]. Furthermore, this depends on what kind of sound we are mapping; random forest works well at mapping single source points, while the other two
methods are better are mapping out sound paths.
In our proposal we talked about the limitations of the methods presented in the paper [1], namely PCA’s dimensional reduction into PCA space and
affine mapping’s need for well-anchored points. With SVM and a basic neural network we were able to replicate the mappings of both methods while
also outputting into real-world space. The two methods differed on performing without well-anchored points: SVM performed very well in well-
defined space but not otherwise, meanwhile a basic neural network performed well in both these areas.

Out[28]:Using the new data, we found considerably more noise with the support vector machine and neural network methods compared to the random forest
model. For the former two models, three points observed larger amounts of noise (the points nearest the microphone arrays). In the case of needing
to map fewer points, having decision points actually works well. The X GBoost model also works well in this case. W e believe that in this case, because
the output points are few, a trees do not need to find too many unseen points.
However, in terms of generalizable models, this may not be a desirable result. This is why we found – in most cases – that our feedforward neural
network was the best performing model.

Introduction to Eco-acoustic Event Detection
It is important to understand the health of the planet’ s ecosystems in order to help
conserve them. One way that has been employed to assess the health of ecosystems is audio
event detection, which uses the sound generated by animals to detect their presence and
indirectly gauge the health of an ecosystem and is the goal of the TweetyNet machine learning
model. Audio event detection has benefited conservation ef forts because it allows researchers to
automate the task of detecting the presence of birds with the use of machine learning techniques.
A brief example of audio event detection in everyday use is hands-free interfacing, which detects
the presence of spoken voice commands in order to perform the desired action. Eco-acoustic
event detection is audio event detection with the intended use of detecting sounds that are
characteristic of an ecosystem and can be used to assess the health of ecosystems. One of the
most useful indicators of an ecosystem’ s health is bird vocalizations, which are relatively easy to
separate from the background noise of an environment. The usefulness of detecting bird presence
through their vocalizations presents a challenge, as manual inspection and annotation of audio
data is a painstaking process. Through the use of machine learning, we can anticipate a reduction
in time spent manually annotating and identifying birds’  vocalizations which will allow
researchers to monitor and learn about ecosystems with greater accuracy and ef ficiency . Birds
inhabit and share nearly every environmental niche and are more sensitive to ecological change
than other kinds of animals and so are capable of representing the biodiversity of ecosystems
disturbed by deforestation and climate change. By applying eco-acoustic event detection to birds,
it can also be adapted to the detection of other so-called ‘indicator ’ species. Beyond measuringecological health, eco-acoustic detection can accumulate environmental information, refine our
understanding, and reflect on the impact of human activity on our planet’ s health. All of these
goals are possible applications of the TweetyNet model.
Methodology
Machine learning paired with signal processing methods allows for audio data to be
processed and learned as image data via conversion to Mel-spectrograms which can be used to
train TweetyNet, a convolutional and recurrent neural net hybrid model built for the purpose of
event detection in audio data [1]. Initial research for this model’ s potential to be repurposed for
eco-acoustic event detection presented itself as a challenge since there was no ready-to-use
pipeline for replicating preliminary results. Many of the model’ s methods discussed in the paper
such as spectrogram windowing and data ingestion for audio of various lengths were not
available aside from the neural network architecture which was available in the original author ’s
Github repository . The model has been replicated using the paper Pytorch and adapted to use
both CPU and GPU processing. Audio data ingestion has also been generalized to intake various
lengths of recordings from various species for the purpose of diversifying extracted features of
bird vocalizations in the convolutional layers as well as temporal dependent features learned in
the recurrent layers [1]. This replicate model has proven itself an excellent potential tool for
remote sensing as an eco-acoustic event detection method. When compared to published results
that accurately detect the presence of bird vocalizations trained on high-quality annotations from
3 species [1]. Previous iterations of the replicate model have averaged accuracy of .6 - .65 to now
.88-.89, which is well within the range of accuracy discussed in the results of the published work
[1].Audio files are first converted to spectrograms and sliced into windows of a
predetermined length in seconds using fast Fourier transformation and signal processing
methods; the time bins in these windows are time bin frames that are later classified for either
presence or absence of vocalization [1]. The windows resulting classified annotations should
match with what is visually present in the windowed spectrogram image [1]. In the same
iteration of this windowing function, corresponding annotator labels and unique species ID are
sourced from a data frame of annotations which then get grouped with these windows and
corresponding time bins in a dictionary . After being windowed to their new respective lengths,
this object containing the information per window of predetermined length for all audio data
ingested is then split into training validation and testing using a split of 70:10:20. If this data has
been previously processed then these splits can be loaded due to a condition in the data load
function that checks for its expected file path to determine if this preprocessing step is necessary .
After splitting, a GPU device should be configured using the “torch.cuda.device” function.
Training, validation, and test splits are then converted to float sensors, their corresponding labels
are converted to long tensors and sent to the determined device using the “.to” function. These
tensors are then passed into a CustomAudioDataset function which is a wrapper method for
returning the corresponding windows, labels, time frames, and UIDS. If you wanted to display
these values, i.e spectrogram of a window in the windows array , you would need to send them
back to the CPU device then detach them from their computational graph in the GPU device this
then allows NumPy conversion. Since these returned values are tensors and Librosa requires a
NumPy array to display a spectrogram, they can be displayed. It’ s important I mention this
seemingly irrelevant detail since the correct format of the data being processed has proven itself
necessary to the GPUs success. Previous iterations of the model followed the assumption thatGPU could process non-tensor type data but gets rerouted to CPU without explicit notice and
that the data would be sent to the GPU when passed into the model’ s training pipeline function
these were pitfalls that kept the progress of the project stagnant for a short period of time.
However , it was an important learning experience for a first-time deep neural network replication
project.
Now having the data in the correct format and ported to the desired hardware, designating
hardware must also be done for the model. From here the model is ready for training, passed into
the model's training pipeline will be the previously split train and validation dataset as well as
parameters such as learning rate and batch size, and epochs which are configurable JSON
variables in the configs folder . Both datasets will be partitioned in the “DataLoader” function
according to the batch size; this is the number of windows trained on per epoch during the
training and validation training cycles. A learning rate optimizer scheduler is also instantiated
after passing the splits into the data loader . Using the function “OneCycleLR” takes as parameter
input the models selected adam(adaptive) optimizer , learning rate, total epochs, number of
batches per epoch, and a linear aneal-decay strategy for faster conver gence when approximating
global optimum. Both data loader objects(batched datasets), scheduler , and total epochs are
passed into the training.
For the set number of epochs, the batched training and validation datasets are unpacked
from their data loader for their float tensor representations of windowed spectrograms set to
input and long tensor representations of annotation labels set to labels. The inputs are then passed
into the model for feature extraction in the convolutional layer and sequentially learned via the
recurrent layer . The cross-entropy loss is then computed between the output from passing this
batched input into the model and the true batched labels. This loss is then back propagated toadjust parameter tensor values through the use of the adam optimizer; which updates selected
model parameter tensors by using the gradients stored in the same parameter tensors when
“loss.backward()” is called. Linear annealing-decay is applied from the scheduler mentioned
previously to adjust the learning rate, this adjustment occurs per epoch. A similar process is
shared with the validation dataset returning recorded best model weights at each epoch
determined by best validation accuracy scores in those epochs.
The model now trained can generate temporal classifications on the test dataset.
In the testing cycle, the model takes into account the recorded best model weights that were
generated from the training cycle and is loaded into the model through the PyT orch built-in
“load_state_dict” function in the neural network module.py file. Similar to before, the test data is
passed into a data loader for batch size partitioning. The test data loader , selected hop length,
sampling rate, and window size are passed as inputs for the model testing function. The hop
length and sampling rate are used to calculate the number of rows corresponding to the window's
time bin frames which are then labeled either 1 being a classification of presence or 0, absence.
These time bin frames in the window spectrogram match in length to the model’ s Long Short
Term Memory units in the recurrent layer ,  “The number of the LSTMs units is equivalent to the
number of time bins in the windowed spectrogram”[1], this is intentional to learn the temporal
dependencies through forward and backward passes in the recurring hidden cell states being
updated with relevant features to reference in the future in the recurrent layer [1]. During
training, in the convolutional layer features are originally extracted as temporal independent
features [1]. During classification, these features are used as learned filters in the convolutional
layer when the best model weights determined by the validation accuracy are loaded. From these
fresh learned and referenced temporal dependent features, i.e. the vocalizations or environmentalnoise, an influence matrix is returned for these temporal features and their presence and absence
classification [1]. This results in a vector of sequential time bins and their corresponding
probability that a time bin frame t in the window is either a learned vocalization that can be
found in the annotation’ s presence labels or a learned feature of environmental noise in the
annotation's absence labels [1]. The window's predictions are then concatenated together to the
original spectrogram's length; this can then be displayed and be used for clustering analysis.
Such proposed monitoring analysis methods include learning what bird vocalizations are
common to an area. To potentially observe if their presence over time decreases due to known
ecosystem disturbances, this data then can be used for data-driven conservation strategies and
wildlife ecosystem protection enactments.

Neural Network Training Process Meta-Analysis:
Average training time for GPU Model 1 min 10 sec and CPU Model 12 min 33 sec. Due to this
drastic time dif ference, an unpooled two-sample T-test was conducted on the training accuracy
and loss after 100 Epochs to validate exact implementation between the two models’  training
process by investigating whether the means of both training samples (Acc/Loss) dif fer from one
another . In such a test, the null hypothesis is that the means of both groups are the same. Each
model trained a total of 15 times for 100 epochs with a batch size of 64 and a learning rate of
.005 training on the same files on the same computer . The accuracy and loss were recorded for
this analysis and come from their last epoch training cycle. A total of 15 accuracies and losses
are logged from the CPU model(
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1065G7
CPU @ 1.30GHz   1.50 GHz
) and GPU
model(
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 with Max-Q design
).

The resulting test for both models’  training accuracy after 100 epochs yields a p-value of 0.1519.
Using a 95% confidence level we can fail to reject the null hypothesis since the p-value is greater
than the corresponding significance level of 5%.
The resulting test for both models’  training loss after 100 epochs yields a p-value of 0.1877.
Using a 95% confidence level we can also fail to reject the null hypothesis since the p-value is
greater than the corresponding significance level of 5%
-
Typical accuracy and loss graphs for a 100 epoch training cycle for both the GPU(left)
and CPU(right) models are shown. Graph curvature demonstrates a close resemblance
between the two models, suggesting the training process is the same in both models.
Here we see a file of similar species. The one shown previously was used only for
classification; this one here happened to be in the training split. But what can this inform us
about the model? We can see here that this training file likely had detailed annotations, windows
2, 3, and 6 are perfect examples of either background noise or other species activity; it is likely
they were not selected for containing a vocalization for the species of interest. This also involves
the fact that annotators are tasked with annotating the species of interest during the annotation
process. This file was in the train split for training; there are two files of this kind of species in
the training set out of 221 files present in the training split. This observation portrays how well
the recurrent layer is learning the extracted features sequentially and maintaining relevant
features during the forward pass and backward pass learning through time via BPTT
backpropagation through time. It can be confidently said that this model has potential for
eco-acoustic event detection/remote sensing and where future development can further its
potential for multi-class species temporal classifications.
Conclusion
Replicate model results show that the GPU does make an improvement in annotation
quality and acceleration compared to the manual annotation process. Which was sought after by
the original authors of this model. Eager to follow this model’ s paper to replicate results of our
own, implementation of the unshared model PyT orch script has proven the process of building a
deep learning model a slow and concentrated process. Although the original author ’s motivation
to design such a hybrid CNN RNN model was unrelated to the domain of wildlife conservation,
the replicate model demonstrates that such a robust model design can extend benefits across
scientific research domains. This model holds potential for future research and development that
can lead to data-driven conservation policies and monitoring strategies. If given another year towork on this project, proposed developments include adapting this model to classify and count
the species present in a recording.Works cited

 No Relevant Audio Button  
 The first feature I built is the “No Revelant Audio” button 
 (  https://github.com/UCSD-E4E/Pyrenote/pull/264  ). Until  now, users would get stuck if an audio file was 
 empty, and be unlikely to contribute further. By adding a “No Revelant Audio” button, the user 
 experience for annotating audio recordings will be more streamlined. By clicking on the button, a “No 
 Class of Classification” label will be created for the corresponding audio recording. This additional label 
 will also allow easy filtering in the data preprocessing stage. 
 Admin Pr oject Management  
 The second feature I built is a way for admin role users to manage the available projects 
 (  https://github.com/UCSD-E4E/Pyrenote/pull/266  ). If  an admin wanted to declutter the created projects in 
 the admin panel, there wasn't a feature that allowed for that need. Also, if an admin wanted to hide 
 projects from non-admin users, there wasn’t a feature for that need. I resolved those two needs by 
 implementing a removal and a recovery feature. The specific changes I made can be viewed here. Admins 
 can now remove any projects they want to declutter their admin panel and/or hide projects from users.

 Abstract  
 Pyrenote is a project in development by a growing group of student researchers here at UCSD.  
 Its primary purpose is to allow anyone to contribute to research by labeling data in an intuitive  
 and accessible way . Right now it is currently being used to develop a sort of voice recognition  
 for birds. The goal is to make an algorithm that can strongly label data (say where in the clip a  
 bird is calling and what bird is making the call). T o do this, a very vast dataset is needed to be  
 labeled. I worked mostly on the user experience side. Allowing them to interact with their  
 labeling in new ways, such as keeping tabs on their progress and reaching goals. Developing a  
 User Profile page was the primary source for receiving this data and was developed iteratively as  
 a whole new page for the site  
 Using Pyr enote  
 As a user of Pyrenote I came up with a few ideas and improvements I wanted to implement. One  
 of the main issues we faced was needing to ask our team leader , who was the only one who could  
 access the data of our project, for updates. Each time we did this he had to manually go through  
 the data, parse it, and deliver it to us (manually). This is something that can clearly be automated  
 and delivered directly to the user . In the end, my team and I decided to make a User Profile page.  
 Engaging users is key to the Pyrenote workflow , and we need users to be content, because  
 without good users, we don’ t have data.. W e set out to incorporate a user page with a few goals  
 in mind:  
 ●  To allow users to track their progress on their own, in real time   ●  To allow users to access previously annotated clips, in case there was an error , incomplete  
 labeling, or anything else.  
 ●  To allow managers to or ganize and access all this data better as well, without manual  
 intervention  
 Through this process we assessed each of these, and strived for even greater  
 Developing Ideas  
 Differ ent sets of functionality needed  
 This was the first set of users we identified and decided we needed to work for . There is dif ferent  
 data for each and dif ferent ways to access the data so it will allow the development of each part  
 to work fairly iteratively  
 Prototyping  
 Prototype 1  
 The first prototype I made and presented to the team. Developed in   Figma   and shared in our  
 weekly meetings. I eventually got a lot of feedback that paved my direction for the following  
 quarter . A lot more data was desired and or ganized in a dif ferent way  
 Backend Learning  
 I met with one of our lead programmers and designers for the site. Sean helped me throughout  
 this entire quarter and taught me during each step of my journey . First we went over the old  
 prototype and discussed the limitations of it with respect to the currently developed code. Some  
 things were going to be a lot harder to develop than others. W e knew we   could   develop  
 everything we had pictured, but only with enough time. So we set priorities and I made a new  
 prototype  
 Prototype 2  
 Prototype 2  
 New Insights  
 ●  A whole new section to distinguish between groups  
 ●  Group Specific data for each clip  
 ●  A limit to how many clips are shown (not all/infinite)  
 ●  Rephrasing for some words and tables  
 After this I drew up the changes and made that second demo above. Next was to get that working  
 in the frontend code, which went smoothly given I already had a working demo from before  
 New Fr ontend  
 Frontend Complete  
 Works pretty similar to the previous demo and looks similar to the new prototype some  
 adjustments need to be made but that can be done easily . Now we just need to hook it up to the  
 backend  
 New Backend  
 The backend was able to be incorporated partially with ease. After a few meetings and much  
 more learning. W e were able to get some variables in that worked and delivered exactly what we  
 wanted. Most of the other functionality is still a work in progress because it requires writing all  
 new backend code, which I was not previously familiar or experienced with. The tables are a  
 whole level of complexity harder than everything we've done so far , and certainly take time.  
 Sean taught me a lot and I got access to everything on the backend that I need. W e successfully  
 got the page setup to accept data and API calls and tested a few and they work. Everything else is  
 diving into the massive data structures and coding them to search and display correctly (which  
 has been easier said than done). In simpler terms, there’ s a few steps to each problem  
 1)  Find how and where the data is represented  
 2)  Write python code to access it  
 3)  Write some connections in a few JS files allowing communication  
 4)  Find the best way to display the output using HTML/React  
 Most of this has worked in a straightforward manner . The clip history (an ever changing table  
 with lots of dif ferent data points) has been the exception.  
 What Now?  
 Trying to wrap up some data displays (mostly the annotation history). I'm learning a lot while  
 trying to develop the backend code, but with that comes a lot of issues. I was slightly  
 overzealous with how much I thought I could learn and do in these last few weeks of the quarter , 
 but I'm proud of how far I've come and will continue working and see this project through. All  
 the features currently finished are all ready to be deployed, but I’m trying to get the clip history  
 complete before pushing anything.

Project W ebsite
Introduction
Last quarter's project involved downloading twitter data based on pre downloaded
tweet IDs related to C OVID-19. W e peeled back the layers of a misinformation
network using k-core analysis in addition to performing exploratory data analysis.
While this project yielded interesting findings, it seemed limited to C OVID-19-
related misinformation only, and finding similar pre-categorized twitter data such
as this can be very difficult. As a result, we decided to continue our investigation of
misinformation in social media on R eddit's platform.  
We decided to base this project off of R eddit data because R eddit offers pre-
categorized information by virtue of having many Subreddit communities, which
are, generally, communities leaning towards a specific topic.  
Similar projects such as ours have been done in the past. For example, a paper title,
""The W eb Centipede: Understanding How W eb Communities Influence Each Other
Through the Lens of Mainstream and Alternative News Sources"" , written by
Nicolas K ourtelris, Ilias Leontiadis, Michael Sirivianos, Gianluca S tringhini, and
Jeremy Blackburn, also looks into the spread of misinformation on the R eddit
Platform. The paper compares the spread of mainstream and alternative news URLs
on Reddit, T witter, and 4chan, and it finds that 4chan and six selected Subreddits
have a very high percentage of alternative news URLs compared to other
communities [1].  
Our study will also involve identifying the frequency of misinformation on selected
Subreddits based off of the presence of misinformation URLs. Our data will
primarily consist of R eddit submissions and their respective attributes such as
whether there is misinformation, subreddit name, the author, upvotes, downvotes
etc. This will allow us to gauge the presence of misinformation on Subreddits
individually and analyze the relationships between Subreddits based on their
shared users.
In order to identify URLs as misinformation or not, we will use a third party list of
misinformation domains made publicly available by iffy.news  [2].3/6/22, 3:22 PM Report
file:///C:/Users/daminifa/Desktop/DSC180B_Reddit_MisInfo_Capstone/notebooks/Report.html 2/6Methods
System specifications used for our scripts:
At least 2 gigabytes of RAM  
Stable Internet  
First, data will be acquired using the Python R eddit API Wrapper, PRA W, which
provides access to public data made available by R eddit and simply requires
creating an account and an associated application. Getting data in this case
involves two steps: Downloading the data and uploading the data to Google
Sheets.
Choosing the subreddits
We decided to choose subreddits in a way that provides us with a holistic view of
the spread of misinformation. W e identified 5 different types of subreddits to
analyze: T op 5 most popular, Highest raw growth in the last year, P olitical, Covid
related, and News. This way we have a diverse group of subreddits to see where a
disproportionate amount of misinformation is compared to others.
In addition, there is a dynamic topic callled ""Expanded MisInfo Network
Subreddits"", where we can programmatically add new subreddits based off of
analysis of users who are known to post misinformation. So if a subreddit is seen as
popular among the misinfo-posters we analyze (based off of their comments), we
can add that subreddit to our list for future analysis.
Downloading the data
In order to download the data, we simply download the last 1000 submissions
sorted by the upvote count per Subreddit (equivalent of sorting by ""T op""). W e
store the submission data as entries in memory, and then upload it into a google
sheet using Python's gspread package.  
While the data is in memory, we analyze the URLs for every submission. If there is a
URL, it will be identified as misinformation based on whether its domain name is in
our list of misinformation domains. If the URL is identified as misinformation, it will
be flagged as so.  
Uploading the Data
Once the data is all saved in a dataframe, it’ll be uploaded to a google sheet using

The question we wanted to address is “How does the spread of misinformation
vary from subreddit to subreddit, and what is the relationship between these
subreddits?”  
We first identified all of the posts with misinformation URLs and created a separate
dataframe. Afterwards, we created a bar chart that showed the count of
misinformation posts based on each individual subreddit, giving us a good
overview on the prevalence of misinformation in each community.
Based on the misinformation submissions we have, we identify the users and rank
them based on how much misinformation they individually post. This way, we can
identify the most prolific users in regards to the spread of misinformation.
Next, we find the subreddits these users are most active in. This is done by
analyzing their comments.

misinformation are shown below.
This provides some intuition of the misinformation network on R eddit, because the
subreddits with the most misinformation-posters are probably more integral to the
misinformation network.
In addition, we ranked the top categories based on their proportions of
misinformation submissions, and we found that political and news-related
subreddits tend to have a higher proportion of misinformation posts, which was
inline with our initial assumption.
Interstingly, we also ranked the domains that we detected the most, across all
subreddits, and we found that ""breitbart"", ""americanthinker"", and ""flagandcross""
are posted the most often compared to other domains that we encountered.3/6/22, 3:22 PM Report
file:///C:/Users/daminifa/Desktop/DSC180B_Reddit_MisInfo_Capstone/notebooks/Report.html 5/6
Lastly, we plotted subreddits on a scatter plot based off of their average upvote ratio versus the
proportion of misinformation posts. W e found that subreddits tend to have a similar average
upvote ratio despite the proportion of misinformation they have. This indicates that subreddits
are generally idealogically homogenous.
Further Analysis
We also created an interactive topic model and undirected graph, which has been
made publically available on our website . The topic model provides an interesting
outlook on what topics can be derived from the word frequencies found when
analyzing the titles of the misinformation submissions we detect. The distance
between topics is displayed on a two dimensional graph, and a user can click on
the topics to see what words they're made up of. As for the interactive undirected
graph, the user can see which subreddits are at the periphery of the
misinformation network and interact with the nodes to gain a better
understanding.3/6/22, 3:22 PM Report
file:///C:/Users/daminifa/Desktop/DSC180B_Reddit_MisInfo_Capstone/notebooks/Report.html 6/6Discussion & Conclusion
We began this study asking how the spread of misinformation may vary from
subreddit to subreddit and what the relationship between these subreddits may
entail. W e found that subreddits tend to be ideologically homogeneous despite the
proportion of misinformation submissions. Also, we found that certain subreddits
seem to play a larger role in the misinformation network than others, i.e.
""Conservative"", ""Conservatives"", ""walkaway"". W e found that the top misinformation
domains shared among the subreddits we analyzed are ""breitbart"",
""americanthinker"", and ""flagandcross"". Lastly, our hypothesis was confirmed to be
correct when we found that political and news-related subreddits had a higher
proportion of misinformation submissions than other subreddit categories. While
our study is limited by the small sample size of submissions we analyze from each
subreddit, our analysis seems to provide a thorough outlook on the misinformation
network on R eddit because we analyze subreddits of different categories and
expand our view of the misinformation network through utilizing user-comment
activity.

Introduction
Millions of people use platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media
networks. While these platforms grew popular for their social aspects of connecting people, they have also
become popular ways to share and consume news. Since these platforms are so accessible, information
spreads rapidly and virally. One key issue is that social media can be a core source of misinformation as
these platforms are often used to establish a narrative and conduct propaganda without verification or
fact-checking. Over the past decade, the proliferation of misinformation has created concern in terms of
social progress, politics, education, and national unification. Reports from the Pew Research Center show
that 64% of Americans are confused about current events because of the rampant presence of fake news on
social media and 23% have passed on misinformation to their contacts both intentionally and
unintentionally [1]. Thus, it's clear that misinformation spreads very easily on social media platforms
compared to other avenues of communication.
People are increasingly engaging with content that is often flashy and spreading misinformation (i.e
conspiracy theories) but not engaging in fact-checking with the same fervor. Fact-checking and verification
of online information is also a complicated task. Many accounts do not represent real people, posts can be
sponsored, some users may be bots, and political affiliations are usually not disclosed. Sometimes it is
impossible to differentiate between genuine content and content that is intended to manipulate opinions.
This makes it difficult to validate information with the large volume of content churned out daily even for
the most diligent and fact-checking individuals. As a result, many platforms have begun implementing
more fact-checking to combat misinformation at a wider scale but the effectiveness of these initiatives is
unknown.
Misinformation has been shown to mobilize people in dangerous ways and distract people from
truthful cases of wrongdoing or public safety. Through this project, we dissect the spread of misinformation
regarding public health over a time period in which the nation experienced major public health and safety
issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic, mask mandates, uncertainties regarding medical treatments and
development of new vaccines. This investigation seeks to understand how Twitter and YouTube’s platforms
interacted and aided the spread of misinformation by examining the video captions extracted from YouTube
videos linked in tweets discussing anything health-related. The video captions and other YouTube and
Twitter metadata were analyzed using NLP to identify false statements or misleading content. Ultimately,
this work can help determine how to reduce the spread of misinformation by understanding effective
policies against misinformation and creating better misinformation detection pipelines.Literature Review
The spread of misinformation on social media platforms has been researched extensively by past
projects. Both Twitter and YouTube are cognizant of the harmful effects of misinformation on their
platforms and have taken steps to identify misleading content and limit its impact by either removing it or
adding a warning label based on its propensity for harm [2], [3]. Yet, these methods are limited by the
platforms’ ability to accurately identify misinformation. With the large volume of content produced online,
these companies must rely on automated detection of misinformation instead of manual efforts through
their employees.  Identifying misinformation first requires a clear consensus on fact-checking material like
information from government organizations or research bodies. It can be difficult to reach agreement on
what qualifies as misinformation and what does not. Additionally, social media platforms can be wary of
taking an overly aggressive approach to removing content in an effort to maintain open communication and
free speech. Thus, it is important to measure how well Twitter and YouTube are able to remove
misinformation.
Furthermore, content is often exchanged between social media platforms making it important to
study how misinformation might be propagated between Twitter and YouTube. One study found YouTube
to have the strongest association with conspiracy beliefs [4]. As the second-largest social media platform,
content from YouTube is shared or linked on other platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit. Knuutila
et al. used posts from these platforms that linked to YouTube videos to measure how effective YouTube’s
policies were at removing misinformation [5]. This approach enabled the authors to discover which videos
were removed and why, using the Wayback Machine, a digital archive of the internet. Additionally, this
work explores how much misinformation transfers from one platform to another by looking at sharing
statistics and other metadata.
Other works also revolve around methods to detect misinformation in YouTube videos. One study
suggests a data-focused approach to identify content on social media through lexical and syntactical
features from a document along with social context features to train a model based on fact-checking content
and propagation [6]. This approach can be applied to any text like the captions of a video and metadata
available through the platform like engagement statistics.  Jagtap et al. focus upon extracting video captions
from the YouTube API then applying NLP techniques to classify a video as misinformation or not [7].
Their findings show that training word embeddings on Google News and Wikipedia articles can result in
classifiers with high F1 score and accuracy. For YouTube videos dealing with vaccines controversy, they
found that a Support Vector Classifier had the best performance. Some studies also explored the role of
comments in propagating misinformation on YouTube. One paper discusses analyzing user engagement
through comments to help detect misleading content and determine if comments themselves are “inorganic”
or coming from bot-like sources [8]. This paper looks at the behavior of commenters in multiple ways,
including building video-commentator and commenter-comment networks, and sentiment analysis of top
comments, in order to determine how comments can contribute to the spread of misinformation. This
investigation combines these approaches to better evaluate how misinformation spreads between social
media platforms and how effectively platforms can detect misinformation using automated approaches.Methods and Data
Datasets
This work analyzes the video captions of YouTube videos linked in any tweets related to public
health. This data was compiled by first gathering individual tweets.  While Twitter does not provide access
to all tweets directly, this data was acquired by compiling daily tweet ids from Panacea Lab’s Covid-19
Twitter Chatter dataset spanning from March 22, 2020 to September 30, 2021 [10]. Using the Twitter API
and the Twarc2 python library, tweet ids were sampled and hydrated into complete tweet objects which
provided more complete data about the tweets including the text, author id, urls, date, and other useful
information. These tweets were then filtered to check if the text content of the tweet contained any key
terms relating to public health. Additionally, tweets were filtered to check if they contained any links that
led to a YouTube video. Any such tweets were compiled into a dataset with the hydrated tweet objects and
the YouTube video ids were stored separately.
The resulting dataset of video ids was then used to create YouTube data using the YouTube Data
API and the YouTube Web Client. Special considerations were taken when fetching the video captions or
subtitles. Firstly, not every video had captioning provided by the video creator. In that case, YouTube will
often auto-generate captions which will not be completely accurate. Other times, the captions are in another
language but the YouTube API provides the ability to translate captions into a specified language. In both
situations, this dataset uses the available English captions whether they are autogenerated or translated.
Additionally, the YouTube API can be used to find other information about a YouTube video using the
video id. Our dataset contains relevant data including video title, date posted, like count, comment count,
view count, description, video tags, and category that can be useful in determining if a video is contributing
to the spread of misinformation.
One key consideration for the dataset was missingness. Between the date they were posted and then
accessed, tweets can be removed by Twitter for violating the platform’s policies or even deleted by the user.
Twitter removes many tweets that the platform detects to have a high propensity for harm and contain
misleading information and YouTube has similar platform policies. Thus, tweet and video missingness is
not independent of misinformation and we will have to take this into account in our analysis.
Misinformation Detection
The focus of this research is to detect misinformation on YouTube which was accomplished by
building a NLP model to categorize whether the text of YouTube video captions contained false and
misleading information or not. Since our dataset of YouTube videos were not labeled, our model was
trained on a pre-labeled dataset containing the text of articles with real and fake news from Kaggle [11]. We
also created a text processing pipeline to prepare the caption texts for analysis. This included normalizing
the case of the text, removing punctuation, removing stop words, tokenization, and lemmatization. Stop
words are the most common words in language like “a”, “the”, “is”, “are”, etc. which do not add any
context or information so removing them is important to ensuring the model focuses on the relevant terms.
Tokenization is the process of splitting the text into individual words or sentences so that the model can
work with smaller pieces of data that are still coherent and relevant to the context outside of the text. Lastly,
lemmatization is the process of converting a word to its lemma, or returning an inflected word to its root
word, in contrast to stemming which simply removes the suffix of a word.Before this cleaned text data can easily be used to build a misinformation detection model, it has to
be first transformed into a feature vector. For this investigation, we created a TF-IDF vector. TF-IDF stands
for term-frequency inverse-document-frequency and it calculates how much a token appears in a specific
document as compared to the entire text corpus. As a result of this calculation, TF-IDF is able to identify
how important a word is, so in the vector the weight assigned to each token not only depends on its
frequency in a document but also how recurrent that term is in the entire corpora.
After vectorization, we build the final model. We tried multiple classifiers including Logistic
Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and finally found that sklearn’s Passive Aggressive Classifier had
the best performance on the training dataset which was then used to detect misinformation from the
YouTube videos.
Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis
Topic modeling is a technique to extract the hidden topics from large volumes of text. As an
unsupervised process, topic modeling is quite valuable as it is able to discover hidden semantic structures in
text.  We implemented the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm for topic modeling through gensim
to determine the dominant topics found in misinformative YouTube videos. LDA builds a topic per
document model and words per topic model, using Dirichlet distributions. The algorithm takes in a number
of topics, then rearranges the topics distribution within the documents and keywords distribution within the
topics to obtain a good composition of topic-keywords distribution.
Next, we performed sentiment analysis on our YouTube videos to gauge if there was a difference in
the engagement of positive and negative sentiment videos. We then wanted to see if there was a relation in
the sentiment of the videos and whether the videos were spreading misinformation or not.
We trained a Logistic Regression model to predict the sentiment of videos. In order to label our
videos for training, we researched what percentage of likes on a video deems it successful. On average,
receiving likes that total 4-10% of the total views or above is seen as the baseline for a good video. We
decided to take the upper limit of 10% and label all videos with a ratio of likes to views higher than 10% as
positive. Any video with a ratio that fell below the threshold was labeled negative. We then fed this labeled
data into the model with a 80/20 train test split.
We created two models following this labeling logic. The first model dealt with predicting
sentiment based on video titles. The second model predicted sentiment using the video descriptions. Once
we finished our models, we plotted our positive and negative sentiment videos to see how the distribution
of misinformation spread compared.
Results and Conclusions
Model Evaluation
We considered several models using TF-IDF vectorization on our text which we evaluated through
their accuracy score. We found that the Passive Aggressive Classifier from sklearn had the best accuracy
score of 84.6%. This was the expected result as the Passive Aggressive Classifier is suited for online
learning that deals with large sets of data and their loss function is passive when dealing with an outcome
that has been correctly classified, and aggressive when a miscalculation takes place, thus the model isconstantly self-updating and adjusting. Running this model on our dataset of YouTube captions resulted in
23% of the video captions being classified as misinformation.
Topic Modeling
The LDA model for topic modeling was built using cleaned captions from the YouTube videos
collected from Twitter. It is important to find a good number of topics for the LDA model because it will
provide meaningful and interpretable topics. Picking higher numbers can sometimes provide more granular
sub-topics but if the number of topics is too high, the same keywords will be repeated in multiple topics. To
find the best number of topics for the LDA model, we evaluate model performance using a coherence
score. Coherence measures the degree of semantic similarity between high scoring words in the topic.
These measurements help truly distinguish topics that are interpretable and understandable. We measured
the coherence of LDA models built using 2, 8, 14, 20, 26, 32, 38 topics and plotted them below. As seen in
the chart, the LDA model with 8 topics has the highest coherence with a score of 0.369. Thus, this is our
optimal model for topic modeling.
The image below is a sample output from pyLDAvis which visualizes the topics produced by the
optimal LDA model and associated keywords. Each bubble on the left-hand side plot represents a topic.
The larger the bubble, the more prevalent is that topic. The highlighted bubble updates the words and bars
on the right-hand side which are the salient keywords that form the selected topic. As seen in this example,
topic 5 is focused on vaccine mandates in the workplace.
After discovering the dominant topics across the documents in the entire corpus, we also found the
dominant topic in each sentence of the caption texts and most representative caption texts for each topic.
Lastly, we looked at the topic distribution among video captions and found that topics 2 and 4 were the
most dominant topics, appearing in 53% and 42% of video captions texts respectively. Topic 2 was focused
on the origins of COVID-19 with keywords like coronavirus, China, Wuhan, and lab while Topic 4 was
regarding COVID-19 vaccines with keywords such as vaccine, booster, and dose. Topic modeling provides
a deeper insight into the topics covered in YouTube videos linked in Twitter. Clearly, contentious subjects
that are often sources of misinformation are frequently spread on social media platforms as evidenced by
the dominant topics we discovered..
YouTube Video Sentiment
We created two logistic regression models to predict the sentiment of videos. The model based on
video descriptions, with an accuracy of 0.83, performed better than the one run on video titles, which had
0.75 accuracy.
Looking into the video descriptions further, we were able to isolate the terms that appeared most
frequently in both the positive and negative sentiment videos. The following are the most frequently found
terms in positive videos and negative videos respectively:
 
Videos about general news channels seemed to have a more positive reaction from viewers than
videos about specific platforms like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, tv9kannada, or CTV news. China and
omicron as terms have a higher appearance in videos that were taken negatively. African Diaspora News
and non-English words appear in high amounts in positively received videos.
Sentiment Vs Misinformation
We found that the videos with positive sentiment had a slightly higher rate of misinformation
(25%) vs negative videos containing misinformation (~17%).
These results raise an interesting question of how people react to videos. Are they reacting more
positively when given specific types of information or are people being exposed to misinformation content
that is more likely to yield a positive reaction?
Missingness
Missingness can be caused by several factors on both Twitter and YouTube. Oftentimes, users
themselves can remove content, but the platforms themselves can also remove any content they believe
violates their policies. With misinformation on the rise, social media platforms have developed policies to
combat this and will sometimes remove content that contains false or misleading information. As a result,
missing tweets and videos are not trivial and cannot be ignored in the conclusions we draw. After fetching
the tweet objects from the Twitter API, we conducted some exploratory data analysis to gain an overall
understanding of the available tweets. First, we calculated the number of tweets that were hydrated into
tweet objects and found the number of tweet ids that could no longer fetch tweets because they had been
removed from the platform. To do so, we randomly sampled 10,000 tweet ids from the full tweet id dataset
to build a 95% confidence interval of the proportion of missing tweets. This method resulted in an interval
of (0.19, 0.37). As mentioned earlier, we are not able to verify the reason the tweet is unavailable but there
is a higher chance that it was removed for violating Twitter’s policies including promoting misinformation.
Similarly, any YouTube videos linked in the missing tweets have a stronger likelihood of being related to
misinformation.
Future Exploration
The distribution of misinformation vs fact-checked information between positive and negative
sentiment videos shows us that there may be a higher rate of positive engagement among misinformation
related videos. This could be due to how social media platforms’ algorithms promote the misinformation
videos or may be due to how viewers intake the information differently. Looking into this further will help
us further find ways for social media platforms to better detect and reduce the spread of misinformation.
This work has the potential to expand beyond Twitter and apply to other social media platforms
like Facebook, opening the door for comparative analysis to see how different communication forms affect
the spread of misinformation. Most YouTube videos linked in tweets linked Instagram and Facebook
accounts, websites, and subscription services for their viewers. A multidimensional analysis on these
connections between platforms could be an interesting next step. This avenue of exploration will also help
determine the most effective ways that these platforms can detect and remove misinformation before it has
the chance to spread. One issue faced in this investigation was the sparse presence of YouTube videos
linked in tweets. This could be resolved by searching for video ids on other platforms or expanding the
domain beyond public health and including other controversial topics such as 9/11 conspiracy, election
fraud, or Flat Earth theory. Increasing the size of the YouTube caption dataset would help improve the
misinformation detection model. Another way to improve this model would be to train it on a subset of
labeled caption data. Furthermore, this version of the model uses a TF-IDF vector as its embedding vector.
This could be replaced by other word-to-vector embeddings such as GloVe or word2vec. Further
improvements to automated misinformation detection, especially on autogenerated or translated text
content as this investigation focused on will greatly help prevent the spread of harmful misinformation on
social media platforms.References

Abstract
In the field of particle physics, there
are a myriad of methodologies for
model-making decisions which we need to
balance. Due to the properties of the
particle-tracking (like the incredibly short
lifetime of particles), the process of
distinguishing jets and particles requires
some helps from artificial intelligence or
deep learning. Our project utilized elements
of Graph Neural Networks, including
convolutional layers such as EdgeConv and
GENConv . In Quarter 1 of our project, we
looked at how the Deep Sets Neural
Network (DSNN) & Fully-connected Neural
Network (FCNN) perform using a
Reciever -Operating Characteristic (ROC)
curve and AUC% (Area Under the Curve) of
the aforementioned ROC. In this quarter
(Q2), we had hoped to extend and
out-perform the previous models utilizing a
graph neural network, which we believed
was able to capture the inherent structure of
the data generating process (DGP), aka. the
particle collisions. A ROC curve helps
visualize the false positive and true positive
rate of our model, while the AUC provides a
point estimate that tells us how our model is
doing overall. We also used Designed
Decorrelated Taggers (DDT) to decorrelate
the predictions from the jet mass using a
mass-varying threshold for cuts on the
output predictions of our model. This
procedure helped further cement the finding
that jet mass is a particularly good estimator
for discovering H->bb jets, and therefore
Higgs Boson fields/particles.Particle Physics Domain

Introduction
Before having more details of our project,
some terms need to be explained. A jet is a
spray of particles that goes in the same
direction. And there are tons of jets when we
collide the protons in the Lar ge Hadron
Collider (LHC) like q/g jet, b jet, W/Z -> qq
jet and H->bb jet. Due to the properties of
jets, it reproduces the Higgs boson more
likely . We need to distinguish the H-> bb jet
from all the others. As for the importance of
Higgs boson particles, it is the first and only
spineless elementary particle observed and
the building blocks of the universe while it
is the mass-giver of other particles. Diving
deep into the unknown properties of the
Higgs boson would definitely help us to
understand the existence of the universe and
something relevant to dark matter .
Also, false positive rate (FPR) and true
positive rate (TPR) are measurements for
accuracy . Taking medical diagnosis as an
example, we suppose there is an anomaly
detection test that checks the existence of a
certain type of disease. If the patient is sick,
there would be two dif ferent outcomes. One
is the patient is sick and the test is positive
(the test considers the patient is sick) and
another outcome is that the patient is sick
but the test is negative (the test considers the
patient is not sick). Thus, there are four
situations and in this case, false positive is
that the patient is not sick but the test
considers it as sick, false negative is that the
patient is sick but the test considers it as not
sick, true positive is the patient is sick and
the test considers it as sick and true false is
the patient is not sick but the test considers it
as not sick. TFR means𝑇𝑃/𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑁
which represents the probability that an
actual positive will be test positive. FPR
means
which represents a𝐹𝑃/𝐹𝑃+𝑇𝑁
positive result will be given when the true
value is negative.
Also, signal in our project is actually the
H->bb jets (Higgs events) which is rare andParticle Physics Domain

its products are created by other protons
decaying and the QCD events are
backgrounds or noise which are hard to
avoid due to the data generation issues, data
collection issues and some other experiment
issues. To improve this condition, we need
to filter these out when we process our
models.
Figure Signal (Higgs) Events
Figure Backgrounds(QCD) events
Motivations
In the previous quarter , we tried graph
neural network model with deep sets and
adversarial neural network. And in this
project, we want to try something new and
different like some fresh convolutional
layers like GENConv and EdgeConv to see
whether our model could perform better or
not. Meanwhile, we choose mass as the
measurement of evaluation because mass
heavily influences our model.
Data
The data collected at CERN (European
Organization for Nuclear Research) was
gathered by using simulated proton collision
events. These events were used to gather
information about track, secondary vertex,
and jet feature data which could be used to
inform the machine learning algorithms
which can classify Higgs Bosons as they
decay to bottom quark-antiquark pairs.
Labels
Labels in the dataset are used to dif ferentiate
between H-bb jets and all other jet types

resulting from the strong interaction
between quarks and gluons  (e.g. quantum
chromodynamics, aka QCD).
Track Featur es
Track features in the dataset are properties
of tracks (e.g. transverse momentum /
maximum relative momentum, number of
tracks, maximum signed 3D impact
parameter value, etc.). Tracks themselves
are simply the paths which the newly
created hadrons (resulting from the particle
collisions) took as they exited the collision.
Secondary Track (SV) Features
SV Features in the dataset are properties of
the decay occurring and jet originating at the
secondary vertex (e.g. transverse momentum
/ maximum relative momentum, number of
secondary vertices … etc.). The secondary
vertex is the location where a bottom hadron
decays into other hadrons; a significant
number of hadrons from a jet initiated by the
production of a bottom quark come not from
the collision point, but from the secondary
vertex.
Jet Featur es
Jet features in the dataset are properties of
the jet itself, a collection of particles which
emanate and collimate from the initial
collision point (e.g. transverse momentum /
maximum relative momentum, sdmass,
mass. … etc. ). The jet itself is the tar get of
classification for our purposes of detecting
h->bb jets.
Methods
Graph Neural Network
Graph neural network is a type of machine
learning which takes or extracts key
information from a graph that contains
nodes and edges like jets of particles. Based
Particle Physics Domain
6
on these information, graph neural networks
make predictions. Taking the social relation
as an example, the nodes would be
individuals and the edges could be the
relationships between each individual.
GENConv
GENConv is a model for
implementation of GCNs (Graph
Convolutional Networks). Regular GCNs
model suf fers from the vanishing gradient,
overfitting and over -smoothing when the
layers go deeper and deeperGCN here
differentiate generalized aggregation
functions like mean function and max
function while the creators of it proposed
MsgNorm as a new normalization layer and
another pre-activation for GCNs. In other
words, for exact operation and mechanism
behind, the model combines information
from the regular node and its neighbor by
aggregating then updating the node feature
by giving the aggregated value. As for
regular GCNs, it just gives information
about connected neighbors for updating the
node feature. Moreover , the specialty for the
method is that the creators made a novel
generalized aggregation function to cover all
common sorts of aggregation functions. And
according to their essay , the model boosted
performance significantly . (Li, Xiong,
Thabet, & Ghanem, 2020)
As for the results of GENConv so far , we
have finished this and we plan to figure it
out at the end of week 5.
EdgeConv
EdgeConv is the implementation of
deep learning models which could
tremendously increase the performance of
these models because first, it acts on graphs
dynamically computed in each layer of the
model, incorporates local neighbor
information and can be used for learning the
global properties. Moreover , the EdgeConv
helps the model to handle irregularity easily
but the major dif ference between this andParticle Physics Domain
7
other methods is that it captures the local
geometric structure while still maintaining
its own permutation invariance. Besides
that, EdgeConv could generate edge features
that describe the relationship between a node
and the neighbors and is capable of grouping
nodes both in Euclidean space and in
semantic space which would be extremely
useful for particle physics.

EdgeConv is calculated by aggregating the
edge features associated with all the edges
emanating from each connected vertex.
Designed Decorrelated T agger
DDT  could provide a simple approach to
substructure decorrelation that the DDT
transform yields a jet substructure
discriminant which is decorrelated from the
jet mass. (The ATLAS Collaboration 2018)
Meanwhile, it could also define a
mass-dependent threshold to reduce the
impact. Decorrelating the jet mass is useful
as the model can learn to distinguish signal
from noise using the dif ference in mass.
Measurement
As for measurement, we still choose
to use the plots of AUC and the plots of
ROC to represent the final performance of
models. ROC(Receiver operating
characteristic) here helps to measure the
performance of our GNNs model at all
classification thresholds using 2 parameters,
True Positive Rate(TPR) and False Positive
Rate(FPR).

Related Works
To improve our model predictions, we
decided to use a graph neural network
approach. In order to approximate the results
of the paper we were expected to replicate,
we achieved / surpassed the accuracy of the
initial model (Deep Sets NN) we had
utilized during quarter 1. In the research
process, we conducted a literature review of
graph neural networks which specifically
utilize convolution, as we believed
convolution and convolutional models can
discover patterns not only between node
features, but also between jets / i.e particle
interactions. For example, we specifically
looked at papers which go over EdgeConv
(Wang et al., 2019) and GENConv (Li. et al.,
2020) convolutional layers and their
implementation in graph neural networks.
Conclusion
After visualizing the ROC curves
and comparing the AUC of our GENConv
Graph Neural Network to the previous
FCNN/DSNN we found an improvement of
about 1.2% to last quarter's
highest-performing model, the Deep Sets
Neural Network - which was our goal.
However , the improvement was much more
when compared to the more basic FCNN, as
we saw an improvement of about 9.4%,
which gives weight to the hypothesis that
graph neural networks are an excellent
model choice. Applying the DDT  procedure
(i.e decorrelating the mass from the
signal/qcd background) showed us that the
results of our model get worse when the
influence of mass is removed from the
predictions - and the influence is visible
across models and the dif ference
mostly
maintains the order in terms of performance.
Ultimately , we were able to replicate figures
4, 5, and 8 in the paper ""Interaction
networks for the identification of boosted HParticle Physics Domain
10
→ bb decays"" by Duarte et.al. We
discovered that particle jet mass is a
valuable predictor for the Higgs Bosons and
that the choice of model is crucial in
improving the accuracy . For example, we
found the Deep Sets NN model performs
about equally to our fairly simple GENConv
Graph NN, because the variable nature of
Deep Sets is able to capture the inherent
structure of the ROOT  / Awkward data
provided by CERN / LHC. Further , looking
at the jet mass distribution and the ef fect
DDT  has on our predictions was able to
convince us that decorrelating the mass is
not a good idea.

1 Introduction
With the rise of music streaming services on the internet in the 2010's, many
have moved away from radio stations to streaming services like Spotify and
Apple Music. This shift oers more specicity and personalization to users'
listening experiences, especially with the ability to create playlists of whatever
songs that they wish. Oftentimes user playlists have a similar genre or theme
between each song, and some streaming services like Spotify oer recommen-
dations to expand a user's existing playlist based on the songs in it. Using
Node2vec and GraphSAGE graph neural network methods, we set out to create
a recommender system for songs to add to an existing playlist by drawing infor-
mation from a vast graph of songs we built from playlist co-occurrences. The
result is a personalized song recommender based not only on Spotify's commu-
nity of playlist creators, but also the specic features within a song.
2 Data
Our song song recommendation system will work with just any music dataset
that contains a community of users with playlists that they have created. The
most popular of these would likely come from Apple Music, Spotify, Youtube, or
Amazon as they are by far the most used music streaming services in America
(that support playlist creation) as of January 2021 [1]. In all the markets Spotify
and Youtube contend for the most used, but Youtube is not solely a music
streaming service, and they do not release data for public use as readily as
Spotify does, so we chose to go with Spotify as our dataset.
In January 2018, Spotify released a vast dataset containing 1 million playlists
created by users between January 2010, and October 2017 for the purpose of
an online data competition to try to predict subsequent tracks within a playlist
[2]. Though the competition is over, we used this dataset of user's playlists
1to try to create personalized recommendations for a user's playlist. Currently
we have taken the rst ten thousand playlists from this dataset to train our
model on, though scaling up to include more playlists (and subsequently songs)
is possible, but currently not necessary for us to demonstrate the ecacy of this
recommender.
Features
From these ten thousand playlists, we extracted all of the unique songs, which
comes out to around 170,000 unique songs. We then utilized the Spotify de-
veloper public API to query information about each of these songs and obtain
features for our model. These features include Spotify's own extracted numerical
data from each song, of which we kept the following [3]:
Danceability | Numerical - How suitable a track is for dancing.
Energy | Numerical - Intensity and activity.
Loudness | Numerical - Overall loudness of a track in decibels.
Speechiness | Numerical - Presence of spoken words in a track.
Acousticness | Numerical - How acoustic the track is.
Instrumentalness | Numerical - How instrumental the track is.
Liveness | Numerical - The presence of an audience in the recording.
Valence | Numerical - The musical positiveness conveyed by a track.
Tempo | Numerical - Estimated tempo in beats per minute.
Duration | Numerical - Duration of the song in milliseconds.
Key | Categorical - The key that the track is in.
Mode | Categorical - Major or minor modality of a track.
Time Signature | Categorical - Estimate of time signature.
For our recommender system to successfully provide personalized recommen-
dations, we work under the assumption that when users create playlists manu-
ally, they generally will add songs that are similar to each other in some ways.
A playlist could be comprised of songs pertaining to a specic genre like dance
music or r&b, but it could also reect a specic mood like happy songs that
make you want to dance, or quiet sad songs. So within a playlist, we would
expect the measures of the features above to be quite close to each other. To
ensure this we examine the distribution of variances of the features from a ran-
dom sample of songs, versus the distribution of variances from a random sample
of playlists.
2Figure 1: Variance distributions over 200 random samples of 70 songs each.
3Figure 2: Variance Distributions of 200 randomly sampled playlists.
For comparing the variances of song features, we sampled 200 random playlists
and compared the distribution of variances to 200 random samples of songs
from a population of all songs. Each random sample was 70 songs, the average
length of the playlists that we had sampled. When we compare the variance
distributions from Figure 1 to Figure 2, we can see that there is a tendency for
many of the features to be right skewed, indicating an overall smaller variance
for playlists. This supports our hypothesis that songs within playlists change
much less than randomly selected songs. There are additional measures and
gures included in the EDA notebook in src/analysis.
4Graph
The graph we created consists of about 170,000 nodes corresponding to each
unique song, and a vast set of edges connecting the songs that appear in a playlist
from the rst 10,000 playlists we selected. To create an eective recommender,
we needed a way to rank the closeness of two songs, so as our aggregate we
decided on co-occurrence of songs within playlists as the edges between them
with a weight on each edge representing the amount of co-occurrences across all
playlists. It should be noted that this method of connecting songs through co-
occurrence can be considered as a hyperparameter for the entire pipeline. There
are some other possible ways of determining edges and edge weights in the graph
such as connecting nodes based on how close they appear to each other within
a playlist, or how many times two songs that appear together in a playlist were
not skipped. We chose simply co-occurrence for our graph because we want to
capture node neighborhoods of songs that are alike for our recommender, and we
assume that people will create playlists of songs that are at least somewhat alike.
We believe this is sucient for this purpose, but with future optimizations and
time to re-create graph structure, trying dierent methods for graph creation
could yield potentially benecial results. Each node also contains a feature set of
the features that are described above. With weighted edges and node features,
we would have enough data to create a personalized link prediction problem.
Our result was a weighted adjacency matrix with the following measures:
Category Measure
Nodes 461880
Edges 106486690
Average Degree 461.1011
Features 13
Figure 3: Descriptive Statistics for Graph Structure.
Though the graph is a network created from the inputs of various users,
it holds a few advantages over a typical collaborative ltering network rec-
ommender. The weighted edges were created from information about the co-
occurence of songs between the many playlists that we have sampled, but the
nodes themselves are unique songs that contain descriptive audio features about
themselves. By incorporating these features as well as the weights on the edges,
we can begin to dene more general groups of songs (playlists) that are based
on more than just user input, but about the nature of the songs themselves.
5Figure 4: Graph Covariance.
Using a graph for our recommender also adds a solution for cold start issues
that many existing recommenders have. GraphSAGE, an inductive algorithm,
aids with this issue in that it will be able to create a node embedding for an
unseen node using the information that was gathered from node neighborhoods
from the training data. Where a traditional recommender may fail in these type
of problems, GraphSAGE can readily add new data and create edge predictions
for them because of the embedding that can be generated from its features as
well as the neighborhood that it falls in, which in this case would be what
other songs appear in the playlist(s) that the new song has been added to.
This inductivity also makes re-training of the dataset unnecessary whenever
new nodes are introduced, which for Spotify-a music streaming service that
constantly hosts new music from creators-is a scalable and realistic approach.
3 Methods and Literature
Node2Vec
One of the earlier graph-based methods is the node2vec which uses biased
random walks to create low dimensional space representations for nodes [4].
This algorithm aims to preserve node neighborhood networks for the node em-
beddings and it allows for more accurate classication on nodes because of these
neighborhoods. The algorithm utilizes biased 2nd order random walks at the
core of its algorithm with p and q tunable parameters to determine the proba-
bility of each node subsequent from the original of being visited. Tuning of these
parameters allows for the user's choice of having a more local walk emulating
bread-rst sampling, or a more explorative walk emulating depth-rst sampling.
The p parameter determines the probability of a node being revisited right after
6a step, where a high value makes it less likely that the node is revisited, pro-
moting a depth-rst random walk. The q parameter controls the probabilities
of stepping to an unvisited node, where a higher value is biased towards local
nodes and a smaller value promotes visiting nodes farther from the original.
Figure 5: Grover and Leskovic visualization of the node2vec random walk [4].
\t"" is the starting node, \v"" is the current node in the random walk.
In our edge prediction model, we experiment with node2vec to create node
embeddings which we then input into a KNN model to generate our predictions.
We compare that with the following GraphSAGE method.
As a baseline model, we built Node2Vec embeddings for songs in the graph
based on the weighted connections of co-occurrences in playlists that existed.
Using these node embeddings, we fed them into a K-Nearest Neighbor model to
nd similar embeddings to serve as recommended songs for each song. We ex-
plored this model because this is a common method used to encode graph data
into a single feature set alongside song features and doesn't suer from scala-
bility issues like Graph Convolutional Networks do. It also was able to account
for weighted edges that we created in our song graph. After nding similar em-
beddings for each song, we treated those as predicted edges to evaluate against
ground truth to compute precision and recall metrics. We also aggregated the
closest embeddings to be incorporated into a recommender. Some drawbacks
we expected were performance and accuracy of Node2Vec embeddings in rep-
resenting neighborhoods as well as runtime issues when computing K-Nearest
Neighbor on heavily connected songs with high degrees.
7GraphSAGE
GraphSAGE is a framework for node embeddings that separates itself from
existing transductive methods that require every node to be present in the
training process by proposing an inductive approach to create node embeddings.
This is a much more scalable approach that is ideal for large networks that don't
all t into memory, and that can be continuously updated.
Figure 6: Hamilton, Ying, and Leskovic's visualization of feature aggregation
from a node's neighborhood [5].
The graphSAGE algorithm's inductive ability comes from its use of neighbor-
hood feature aggregation for a node to create an embedding for that node that
will capture information about its neighborhood. Aggregation can be done in
a number of ways, the most common being LSTM, mean, pooling aggregator
functions. Depending on the aggregator chosen, graphSAGE will capture dier-
ent information from its neighboring nodes. It is the neighborhood aggregation
that makes it so that when a new node is added to the graph, its embedding
can be generated from its features and neighboring nodes, rather than having
to create new embeddings using the entire graph structure over again.
L(zu) = log((zT
uzv)) QEvnPn(v)log(( zT
uzvn))
The above loss function an unsupervised loss function used when generating
embeddings [5], where u and v are two neighboring nodes, Q is the number
of negative samples, vnis a negative sample, is the sigmoid function, Pnis
the negative sample distribution, and zuare the representations. For an edge
prediction problem, our negative samples are generated from the non-existing
edges between each song node.
8Based on the graph of all songs with links weighted by co-occurrences in
the playlists, we compute GraphSAGE embeddings for each song with a mean
aggregator. Specically, given the original node features, each step of Graph-
SAGE will sample from the neighbors of each song and average the information
of those samples. With those new representations of each song on hand, we then
feed those embeddings into a multilayer perceptron predictor. For each pair of
nodes in the graph, the predictor concatenates their corresponding embeddings
as the edge feature, runs those embeddings through fully-connected layers and
outputs a scalar score for each edge of the given graph.We then use binary cross
entropy as the loss function, which compares the predicted probabilities of the
edge existence and the ground truth and penalizes the probabilities based on
the dierence.
We employed the GraphSAGE model since it provides a general and inductive
framework which leverages node features to eciently generate embeddings for
large graphs with rich node attribute information, which matches our case of
Spotify million playlists. For the downstream link prediction task, we exper-
imented with dot product predictor and multilayer perceptron predictor and
observed better loss update with the multilayer perceptron.
Recommender
With the trained embeddings of songs in hand, given a playlist with k seed
tracks, for each seed track s and each the candidate track c for recommendation,
we fed the embeddings of s and c into the predictor to compute the predicted
scores, which indicated the probability of a edge existing in between. After
computing the scores for each seed song, we ranked the scores in descending
order and prioritized the recommendation of those songs that have the highest
probability of a link with the seed tracks. Essentially used the score learned from
a link prediction model to determine songs to recommend based on candidate
tracks.

Figure 7: Metrics for GraphSAGE/MLP and Node2Vec/KNN
Link/Edge Prediction Metrics
After running these two models and their respective embeddings, we found
that the GraphSAGE embeddings with the MLP predictor gave the highest
accuracy. This is as expected, as Node2vec embeddings are quite a bit less
complex than the convolutional learning layers that are used in the GraphSAGE
embeddings. The high precision entailed that the model was good at predicting
edges between songs that should exist for a given song and limited false positives
overall. We were more interested in recall as it told us the ratio of predictions
out of all edges that do exist between songs. This was important as we believed
the strongest recommender would rst pull from existing edges that come from
a song but aren't necessarily in a given playlist yet. The decrease in precision
from Train to Test we noticed could have been due to overtting since the recall
stayed the same. We think the model likely recommended relevant tracks but
not in the set of expected results needed for high precision. We saw improvement
in both categories and also saw higher AUC scores in GraphSAGE - MLP. The
AUC score increase showed better performance in predicting true positives and
true negatives over all the data. We can also see this in the ROC curves below
that show GraphSAGE - MLP to have a curve closer to the top left than the
Node2vec - KNN curve.

batches each)
The above graph is the record of training loss for the edge predictions when
training the MLP model, where we trained for 2 epochs, with 82 mini batches
for each epoch. The reason for stopping at 2 epochs is that we saw the loss
begin to stagnate and oscillate around 0.48. To avoid overtting the model,
we ended training at this point. We had also noticed the validation AUC still
increasing in spite of no training loss decrease so this gave us another reason
to stop early to prevent overtting on the validation set. To help with training
speed, we added options to use the CUDA framework and utilize GPUs during
mini-batch training.

170,000 song subset
The above T-SNE plot shows the dierent embeddings of node neighborhoods.
We used embeddings for a subset of 170,000 nodes for better readability, but
the model and the process are the same. We have plotted this with a small
opacy to show the dierent concentrations of embeddings, as the graph is very
dense. Though the plot does not discern groups between a specic feature, it
still serves to show the dierent groups that were captured by the graphSAGE
embeddings.
Playlist Recommendation Results
All of the following are done on recommendation sets for 200 random playlists.
The recommendations are done as sets of the top recommended songs for each
unique song in the playlist. For the example below, each song in the playlist
has one song in the recommendations list that is the top song to recommend to
it that isn't already in the playlist.

Evaluate the Recommender: R-Precision
Given a playlist, we partitioned the list with half of the tracks as seeds and the
rest as masked relevant tracks (i.e our recommendation goals). The R-Precision
was calculated as the number of songs that belongs to the intersection of our
recommended candidate tracks and the masked relevant tracks, divided by the
number of masked relevant tracks. The metric is averaged over all the playlists
to test.
R precision =jG\R1:jGjj
jGj
We randomly sampled 300 playlists and ran the recommender on each. Each
playlist got the same number of recommended candidate tracks as the number
of seed tracks given. The averaged R-precision of these 300 playlists was about
0.0635. This indicated that the recommender will be able to throw out about
6% of the songs that are exactly the ones already in the existing tracks in the
target playlists.
13To further understand the performance, we individually looked at playlists
with high R-precision (i.e 5%) with the lower ones. We observed that for
those playlists with higher R-precision, the average degree of the songs (i.e
average number of songs that appear together with this song in the playlists)
was signicantly lower than those with lower R-precision.
Figure 11: Average degree of seed songs in playlists.
14Figure 12: Distribution of connectivity proportion in recommended playlists.
Song Connectivity in Song Recommendations
Checking all pairs of nodes in the recommended set, and this is the proportion
of thosen2pairs that are actually connected in the main graph (where n is the
number of songs in a playlist). We can see that there is a seemingly normal
distribution, where most of the playlist recommendations have about a 0.5 rate
of neighbors existing together. Though there is some higher connectivity for
some playlists, there are more that seem to be less connected, as indicated by
the very slight right skew. Having this metric is important, because it serves
as a metric for how well the recommended playlist was able to emulate the
relationships between songs in the original playlist. Ideally, we would have
higher values than 0.5, but we suspect that some of this is due to our subset
of only about 460,000 songs. Though they have not released a specic number,
in reality Spotify hosts more than a few million songs on their platform, which
allows for many more complex neighborhoods to form. Were we to scale up
to using every song and playlist co-occurrence connection between them, we
suspect there would be a much higher connectivity rate in the recommendations.
Unfortunately, with our resources and the scope of this project, we are unable
to access all of the songs Spotify has and we don't have computing resources for
such a dataset.
15Feature Distribution in Recommendations
The following tables and histograms are drawn from taking the variance, av-
erage, average dierence of numerical features in consecutive song pairs, and
dierence in range from the original playlists and from the recommended sets.
The dierences between these measures are then taken and the resulting distri-
bution is plotted, indicating the dierence in measures for each audio feature.
The table shows the average of the distribution of dierences for each measure
as well.

17Figure 15: Figure 15 .
In general, we saw that there was little change in the features between the
recommended song sets. For most of the variance and average dierences the
majority of the distribution was below 0.1, especially for the variance of dance-
ability, energy, acousticness, valence, and liveness. There were, however, a few
features that did seem to change more between the recommended song sets, such
as tempo and duration. These two features were somewhat expected to have a
more spread out distribution, as one would not typically expect a playlist to have
songs of all very similar length and tempo. Speechiness was the least changing
feature, which was a good sign, because oftentimes very speechy playlists consist
of rap-heavy songs, and so the recommended songs seemed to reect that.
For future iterations of the model, it may be benecial to try training with
some of the less relevant features like duration and tempo removed. At the
moment we keep them in to see if they can capture more playlist information.
5 Discussion
We set out to use graph based methods to create Spotify song recommenda-
tions for playlists and found promising results overall. We rst looked at link
prediction metrics to determine how our model performed at nding edges that
18should already exist between songs as co-occurrence in playlists. The signi-
cant boost in AUC score, precision, and recall in GraphSAGE over Node2Vec
gave us condence that more of the graph structure was being learned and po-
tential recommendations as a result could be more useful going forward. We
think Node2Vec-KNN did worse, probably due to the embeddings created by
Node2Vec not being accurate enough. In this highly connected graph, the ran-
dom walks could have varied signicantly enough to cause the vector embed-
dings to be less representative of the graph. The intent was to better encode
the graph structure using strategies like GraphSAGE while also retaining song
specic features that could traditionally help in song recommendation as we
assumed similar songs had less variance in features such as acousticness, beats
per minute, or danceability.
When it came to seeing the playlist recommendation results and the actual
tracks that were recommended based on the top candidate tracks for each given
song in a sample playlist, we had mixed outcomes. In many cases, the model
was able to recommend songs in similar genres, by similar artists, and even
specic albums. In other cases, however, the recommendations tended towards
largely popular songs and artists without much genre overlap as we wanted.
We think this could be due to the highly connected nature of the graph and
the heavier weights being put on edges connected to popular songs. In the
GraphSAGE neighborhood sampling, songs with few edges may be close in
proximity to popular songs through our heavily connected graph structure and
thus could have similar neighborhoods even though genres and style might be
vastly dierent.
One thing we denitely would want to experiment with is dierent graph
structures based on not only playlist co-occurrence, but also album or artist
co-occurrence where edges exist between songs if they are in the same album
or by the same artist. This would result in a heterogeneous graph that encodes
varying weights of information in each edge. We also think that lowering the
connectivity by creating edges in a more restrictive way could help with the
GraphSAGE neighborhood sampling for less popular songs. Connectivity likely
leads to higher importance on popular songs, especially for recommendations
and we think the model could personalize better if it functioned on a more
representative underlying graph.
For future improvements on obtaining node neighborhoods based on song fea-
tures, we would like to incorporate a categorical feature that is representative
of a song's genre. This could however be somewhat problematic, as there has
always been some debate around certain songs' classication to certain genres
already, and Spotify does not provide features about a song's genre. Incorpora-
tion of such a feature could yield much better results, as many themed playlists
seem to be centered around one or two similar genres. Future work could make
19use of a classication model for basic song genres, and utilize it in the prepro-
cessing for playlist recommendation to add another categorical feature.
6 Conclusion
The business case for this approach to playlist recommendation, is that once
the graph is built, it is able to add new data concerning both new nodes and
new playlists. GraphSAGE is an inductive approach; re-training of the entire
model would not be required. Because Spotify is ever growing, obtaining new
users and new songs from artists each day, an approach like this that can easily
evolve with growth is needed. Our project provides somewhat of a proof of
concept that playlist recommendation with inductive graph learning approaches
works, though there is room for improvement. We feel like the idea works in
certain instances very well and could help music distribution services nd more
powerful ways to personalize for users. We tried to put emphasis on not only
naively recommending songs from the same artists but also allowing discovery
and dierent styled songs to surface as new avenues to explore.

They extracted features from the songs using the Spotify API and trained models to predict links between songs in the graph. The results showed that the GraphSAGE model performed better than the Node2vec model in terms of AUC, precision, and recall. The authors also evaluated the recommender system by measuring R-precision and analyzing feature distributions in recommended playlists. They found that the model was able to recommend songs with similar genres and artists, but there were also cases where it recommended popular songs without much genre overlap. The authors suggest future improvements such as incorporating genre information and exploring different graph structures based on album or artist co-occurrence.

1. Main Goal
Use graph-based analysis to re-classify stocks and to improve Markowitz portfolio
optimization
2. Introduction
2.1 Motivation
Stocks are classified into different sectors (Energy, Finance, Health Care, etc), and stocks
within the same sectors are assumed to have similar behaviors (movement patterns and risk
profiles). Fund managers worldwide demand a precise classification to control portfolio
sector exposures and thus minimize risks brought by some specific sectors. This could be
considered a sector-level diversification.
The most widely used industry classifications are ICB, GICS for American stocks, and SWS
Research ( 申万宏源 ) for China A-share. They provide a professional guideline for a long-term
stock industry classification. However, the classification is fixed and fails to capture short-
term correlations between stocks in different sectors, and thus fails to embody short-term
co-movement risks between conventionally unrelated stocks. For example, company A infinance sector and company B in energy sector are considered uncorrelated, in a loose
sense, conventionally. Due to a recent announcement of cooperation, their stock prices
started to behave similarly. This particular risk could hardly be hedged against if the fund
manager use a fixed industry classification scheme.
Therefore, a dynamic industry classification is much more recommended for institutional
traders, especially hedge fund portfolio managers on low-frequency trading strategies
(change stock holdings each day, for instance).
To re-classify stocks from stock data, we believe that graph may help filter information and
obtain hidden embeddings of industry information. Two stocks are connected if they
demonstrate a strong coorelation over the given observation time period, and by that
connectivity we may partition the graph and obtain communities.
Henceforth, in this project, for each rolling period, we construct graphs and detect
communities in graphs, and later test if the new classification could improve strategy return
in the Markowitz porfolio optimization procedure. More details are discussed below.
2.2 Report Structure
In section 3 we will talk about the details of constructing a graph for each rolling period,
including the type of graphs used and the algorithms used for community detection. Section
4 introduces the dataset and covers the detail of the experiements and results. Section 5
concludes our investigation. For readers unfamiliar with quant investments, an appendix
briefly covers the complete procedure of conducting a quant research in the domain of low-
frequency stock picking strategies.
3. Graph Formulation
3.1 Build Graph from Financial Data
We would like to build a graph whose nodes are stocks and edges are indicators of
connectivity. Suppose there are  tradable assets and  days for observation, we take the
time-series correlation among stocks as a criteria to add edges.
To compute the time-series correlation, suppose  is the (close) price of asset  at time 
, then the daily return is  ( starts from 2, which means there
are only  returns). Then for any , the time-series correlation is thus given by
where . This could be considered as the ""weight"" of the edge between stock 
and stock . One sometimes need to convert weights to distance between two nodes, and a
naive form is give byN T

dij=√2(1−ρij)Given the similarity measures (correlation) and distance measures, we may build graphs by
using the following methods:
Asset Graph (AG): connect if  is beyond a pre-defined threshold;
Minimum Spanning Tree (MST): sort all  in a descending order, add the edge if after
addition the graph is still a forest or a tree (Kruskal's Algorithm);
Planar Maximally Filter Graph (PMFG): simiilar to MST, but add edge if after addition
the graph is still planar;
Random Matrix Theory (RMT): use modularity optimization methods to directly obtain
clusterings, or alternatively select information from the correlation matrix and feed back
to the previous three models as a refinement.
In this project we use all four types in our experiment.
3.2 Community Detection from Contrcted Graphs
To control the number of industry, we pick algorithms that help generate a prescribed
number of clusters. The following are implemented:
Spectral Clustering
Average Linkage Clustering
Node2Vec + KMeans: conduct KMeans on Node2Vec embeddings;
Sub2Vec + KMeans: conduct KMeans on Sub2Vec embeddings.
(Currently all are built from either spectral clustering and Sub2Vec, will test others later)
3.3 Graph Evaluation
To evaluate if the re-constructed classification is ""good"", we go through the entire low-
frequency stock picking pipeline and plug in new industry information in the final step --
Markowitz Portfolio Optimization -- to see if there is a performance gain in our strategy.
We focus on the following four metrics to measure performance:
excess return: the excess return of the strategy with respect to the index / market;
max drawdowns: max decrease of the portfolio in value;
turnover: measure the rate of invested stocks being replaced by new ones;
AlphaSharpeRatio: return / volatility, measure the ability of maximizing returns over risk.
The dynamic property is done by a rolling-based train test schemed outlined as follows: we
train the graph using  days and test the performance of the graph in the
following  days. Then we move forward  days to retrian the graph. Note that
the test periods are not overlapping, and the train test periods are the same in the factor
combination (machine learning) part of the low-frequency stock picking paradigm. We look
at the metrics of the successive testing periods in our portfolio.

Appendix: Low-Frequency Stock-Picking Precedure
Breakdown
In low-frequency quantitative investment research, the central goal is to predict future daily
returns as accurate as possible. There are the following four steps:
Mine Factors: perform feature engineering on stock information to facilitate predicting
future returns;
Combine Factors: use machine learning algorithms to combine mined factors to predict
future return;
Portfolio Sort/Backtest: at each day, given the prediction, pick the top  number of
stocks with the highest returns from all tradable stocks ( depends on the stock pool,
in this project ). Mimic this using the history data to test if the predictions are
accurate;
Portfolio Optimization: given the selected stocks, assign appropriate weights to each
one to control the overall risk exposure (Industry Exposure, for instance).
In this project, we would like to use graph-based analysis to re-classify stocks and see
if a dynamic industry classification could help improve portfolio optimization
performance. The performance is measured by overall returns and realized volatility given a
tested timeframe.
Mine Factors
Starting from 1960s, people started to use factor model to predict stock returns. CAPM
(Capital Asset Pricing Model) was one of the first formal attempts. Suppose we have M
M
M=100
Ntradable assets, the simplified form is written below:
where  is the predicted future return of asset  and  is a factor and
is the current market return. That is, future stock return depends on current market return. A
simple linear regression could help us identify the exact values of the coefficients for each
asset .
In 1993, FF3 (Fama-French Three-Factor Model) was proposed and its author later won the
Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. It builds on CAPM and appended two other factors:
market capitalization and book-to-market (BM) ratio.
One could observe that there is nothing stopping us from adding more factors (more
features typically brings lower MSE in regression tasks, although collinearity needs to be
either eliminated or circumvented by picking an ML model that is robust to collinearity).
Many modern quant practitioner focus on mining factors. Suppose we have  factors, then
our model becomes
where .
In a hedge fund, usually . But for limited data and computing resources, in this
project . These includes factors computed from daily price and volume data
(momentum, reversal, idiosyncratic returns, technical indicators, and other confidential
ones).
Combine Factors
With the model above, we would like to obtain the trained values for  to predict future
stock returns. Suppose we have  assets,  factors, and pick  days to be our training
period (  in this project. This is roughly a year since there are only 245 trading
days per year), the , features, and , prediction goal, are constructed in the following way:
we flatten each factors and vertically concat them with correct dates aligned, and then do
the same thing for the return panel data. Features in different dates in the same training
period are equally weighted, though it is known empirically that an exponential decay on
dates could boost performance.

Porfolio Sort / Backtest
With the trained model, we could now predict the returns for all tradable stocks tomorrow.
Pick the top  stocks (  in this project, and essentially this is picking one-tenth of
the stocks from the pool of zz1000).  should not be too small since our prediction may be
wrong, capturing stocks not with the hightest returns; nor could  be too large, since we
may not have enough money to invest in all of them (there is a minimum purchase
requirement per stock).
Basic backtest config includes deducting costs (0.0015) for each trade, and we exclude
stocks with special treatment (ST), stocks delisted, stocks meeting their limit up/down
(making it non-tradable), and newly issued stocks (60 days after listing). Benchmark index is
the zz1000 index for computing excess returns.
Portfolio OptimizationM M=100

MWith  stocks selected, we would like to know the exact weights of each investment to
control the overall risk exposure. Suppose  is the predicted return of the  stocks
(machine learning output), the estimated covariance matrix, and  the
weights for each stocks, we have the following constraint optimization problem:
The objective function means we would like to maximize returns and minimize risk at the
same time.  empirically works the best.
Each constraint comes with a different purpose:
Holding Constraint: no short-selling, so all weights shall be postive, and we don't want
to over-invest in one stock, so there is also an upper limit for a single stock weight;
Style Exposure: style factors are also called risk factors, including Market-Cap,
Momentum, and others. We would like its exposure to be controlled over time, and not
using these factors to obtain excess returns;
Industry Exposure: prevent over-investing in a single industry. This is the place where
an alternative dynamic classification is plugged in.
Turnover Constraint: limit the rate of replacement of the stocks to lower costs.M

Abstract
Halıcıoglu Data Science Institute industry partners are constantly looking for fac-
ulty to work on their projects. In order to make this an easier process, we used
Latent Dirichlet Allocation to find the most representative topics written by HDSI
faculty. We processed the abstracts of their published works in order to run an
LDA model on them. We found the topics most associated with them and created
a tool that effectively shows the connection between the author and topics. We
have made significant improvements to a previously existing tool, mainly labeling
our topics and creating a more user-friendly experience. In order to maintain this
tool functioning, we have generated a workflow that allows for future changes.
We have also made a plan for the creation of an additional tool that allows for an
easy search of faculty.
1 Introduction
The Halıcıoglu Data Science Institute (HDSI) at the University of California, San Diego is dedicated
to the discovery of new methods and training of students and faculty to use data science to solve
problems in the current world. The HDSI has several industry partners that are often searching for
assistance to tackle their daily activities and need experts in different domain areas. Currently, there
are around 55 professors affiliated with HDSI. They all have diverse research interests and have
written numerous papers in their own fields. Our goal is to create a tool that allows HDSI to select
the best fit from their faculty, based on their published work, to aid their industry partners in their
specific endeavors. We will be doing this with Natural Language Processing (NLP) by managing
all the abstracts from the faculty’s published work and organizing them by topics. We will then
discover what is the proportion of papers of each faculty associated with each of the topics and
1draw a relationship between researchers and their most published topics. This will allow HDSI to
personalize recommendations of faculty candidates to their industry partner’s particular job.
We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to process our texts and obtain the most frequent words
for each topic. Based on this information, a tool was created in the form of a Sankey Diagram where
a specific number of topics can be selected and the relationships between authors and this number
of topics displayed. The topics now have the appropriate labels that indicate the main topic related
to a particular search/author. The version that this paper discusses is what we call version 2.0 of our
tool.
Since this tool will be used by Industry Partners of HDSI, who might not be familiar with Sankey
Diagrams or could have difficulty interacting with it or interpreting the results, we decided to start
the plan to create a companion tool in the form of a search bar, which we will refer to as Easy Faculty
Search Tool. This is just another way of visualizing our LDA topic modeling results.
2 Previous Work
As mentioned above, this is version 2.0 of the Sankey Diagram tool. Our previous work involved
the replication of an already existing tool made by a team of data scientists at HDSI, which was the
foundation for what we present now. What he had done differently in the past, was changing the
number of topics that were used on each iteration of the replication by each member of our team.
Since there was not a published article related to our particular dashboard tool, our replication was
based solely on the code but theoretically supported by a number of articles related to the methods
utilized. Our work was possible with the use of Latent Direct Allocation and based on published
work by D. Blei, A. Ng, and M. Jordan as well as articles by S. Prabhakaran and S. Kapadia.
3 Literature Review
As mentioned in section a., in order to perform the replication of the exploration tool, we used
texts by the aforementioned authors. “Latent Direct Allocation” is a paper by D. Blei, A. Ng and
M. Jordan that explains in detail the origin and process of LDA. It explains the motivations of
modeling text corpora and the techniques used around LDA. The goal of the paper was to find short
descriptions of the members of a collection that enable efficient processing of large collections while
preserving the essential statistical relationships that are useful for basic tasks such as classification,
novelty detection, summarization, and similarity and relevance judgments[1].
In order to understand the step-by-step process of the coding solution to our tool, articles on Towards
Data Science and Machine Learning Eg were consulted. For an understanding of a less theoretical
overview of LDA, we consulted “Topic Modeling in Python: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)” by
S. Kapadia on the Towards Data Science publication. When it comes to the coding process of our
tool, this article helps us understand how to use gensim to perform LDA.
“LDA in Python – How to grid search best topic models?” by S. Prabhakaran explains how to
perform LDA by using one of the most popular machine learning Python libraries: scikit learn.
Both of the articles provide a step-by-step explanation on how to perform the process, therefore the
combination of them was very useful for the present report.
4 Data
In order to create the tool, an analysis on text data was performed. We decided to use only the
abstract portions of published faculty works and perform LDA on this. The data was obtained from
Dimensions, which is a platform that allows for the search and analysis of over 150 million in-
terlinked data items from across the research world. Such data items include publications, grants,
clinical trials, patents, and policy documents. We manually collected each HDSI faculty member’s
researcher ID from Dimensions and from this, we created a csv file. Dimensions’ application pro-
gramming interface, or API, was used in order to collect the abstracts belonging to these particular
researcher IDs beginning in the year 2015. The following image shows the first 4 rows and a sample
of the columns of the data collected.
2Figure 1: Initial dataset obtained by using Dimensions API
Preprocessing the abstracts by using stemming, removing stop words and the gensim simple pre-
process, as well as adding a column containing the actual HDSI faculty member that was included
in the author list of each paper, resulted in a dataset of the following form.
Figure 2: Dataset including Processed abstracts and HDSI authors.
Figure 2 presents the first five rows of the final dataset used, excluding the columns year,authors
(list form), and title.
We were able to perform LDA on the abstract processed column and to subsequently, use the year
and author data to obtain additional information required like the most predominant topic document
and per author.
Abstract data was used since it is a concise summary of each publication, it is easier and more
efficient to process, and it contains words that are representative of the articles. Therefore, the
dataset presented in Figure 2 was enough for us to perform our tasks and obtain our final tool, as
well as to gain a deeper understanding of the overall data obtained from Dimensions.
In order to improve version 1.0 of our tool, we decided to extract fields from both Google Scholar
and Dimensions to use as labeling for authors and topics.
Since Google does not provide any API for their Scholar product, we used Selenium, which is a
web-crawling framework that can be used for data extraction. Even though we faced this challenge,
3we still decided to use Google Scholar because it provides labels under each author that indicate their
general field, as seen in Figure 3. Google Scholar also has information on faculty that Dimensions
does not, as well as some of their missing articles.
Figure 3: Google Scholar profile for an author shows general field labels. In this case, for Dr.
Eldridge they are ‘machine learning’ and ‘artificial intelligence’.
As for the labeling at the article level, we decided to use Dimensions since it provides Research
Categories under each article, as seen below.
(a)
 (b)
Figure 4: Dimensions example of a publication and the fields of research under which it falls under.
5 Methods
For version 1.0 of this tool, we had manually assigned the labeling of topics but had left out Topic
0-Topic n on the search results of the dashboard.
To allow a better understanding of these topics, we used several methods to find appropriate labels
for our results.
1) We scraped the labels on the Google Scholar profiles of faculty in HDSI and gained a histogram
providing a general view of how they are distributed.
4Figure 5: Unique labels gathered from the Google Scholar profiles.
As useful as these Google Scholar unique labels are for understanding in a broader context what
authors publish, we found that they might not be able to provide an explanation as specific as we re-
quire for our current work. For example, “Machine Learning” is a very extensive field; a researcher
can have a focus on supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, or the ap-
plication of a specific algorithm relating to their particular interest area. Therefore, we decided to
expand our work to the second version of labeling.
2) We also gathered labels from the Dimensions API and we found that they provide a better inter-
pretation at the article level. After selecting the more specific labels for the articles, we can better
understand each article’s main contribution. After aggregating the labels on the topic level, we can
then gain a better understanding of the unsupervised results.
Figure 6: Distribution of labels obtained from Dimensions at the article level.
Now, our next step was to clean up the labels that we considered to be too vague and aggregate the
labels to dynamically represent the topics we have from our topic model.
5For version 2.0 of our dashboard, we combined option 1 and option 2 to provide a better user
experience for our search tool. To make our results easier to understand, we provide the article-level
labels as related fields next to our generated topics. This is helpful because it does not replace the
generated words but provides a broader context to them. It is easier for the user to make sense of the
topics without losing the essence of them.
Since the user can also select a particular researcher on our Sankey diagram, we decided to use the
labels obtained from Google Scholar in this section.
Having labels that only work on a specific set of data would not be useful. We worked on improving
our pipeline to be more adaptable to the data stream. Ideally, the data that we are using to generate
our dashboard will be updated once a year, not only to account for new faculty additions but to
include the most recent publications. This means that our code must also produce meaningful results
in a robust manner. Our pipeline was previously tailored to the newer version of data with specific
year thresholds. However, we fixed this issue and improved our data pipeline, making our code
maintainable and easy to modify and expand. Our ideal goal was that as mentioned previously, the
tool will be useful and robust enough to handle any new incoming data.
6 Results
As shown below, our current dashboard has many useful functions that provide a great amount of
information. We are certain that this tool will be exceptionally helpful towards our industry partners
since it has features such as the topic selection where the proprietary topics are listed to demonstrate
the variety of areas of research our HDSI faculty has to offer. As a topic is selected, they will be able
to find a list of the faculty with their respective papers, along with their abstracts, to give a general
sense of what each faculty member is working on.
Figure 7: Topic Selection feature and list of faculty and their related articles
The researcher selection function is another interesting way of discovering where a specific faculty
member’s line of research actually lies. As an example, in Angela Yu’s case, with a 10 topic model,
her papers demonstrate an expansive variety of topics from Applied Mathematics, to Psychology
and Neuroscience.
6Figure 8: Faculty Selection feature and list of the topics they have written on as well as their respec-
tive articles.
As can be seen in Figure 8, as Angela Yu’s name is selected, you can also see the added Google
Scholar Labels for her fields of research. It is important to note that not all authors had these labels
on their profiles, so a minority of them will be blank.
The third main function is a general word search, where you can input any common word and see
which topic is the most likely to address or contain the specific word. This function provides an
easy and quick way for our industry partners to discover what they are looking for with their specific
job or task in mind. For example, if the user is looking for researchers that have experience with
microbiomes and microbiology, Topic3 would be the most likely to pertain to those subject matters,
as seen on Figure 9. Thus the researchers that are connected to Topic3 would be the best fit for our
industry partner’s particular task. In this case, we can observe that the highlighted flow points to
George Sugihara, Ronghui Xu, Benjamin Smarr, and Robin Knight.
Figure 9: Word Search feature and list of the topics that are more associated with it. On the left-hand
side, the authors that are connected to this topic.
In addition to the dropdown navigation, the enhancement on the labels allow the users to explore the
content of the HDSI faculty a step further. As mentioned, the Google Scholar fields of each author
are extracted to help users to have a broad understanding of the author’s work. One benefit of using
this field is that these labels are created by the researchers themselves, which makes them a reliable
source and a good representation of their general work. In the following example, we can clearly
see that Angela Yu is a researcher dedicated to the cognitive sciences and neuroscientific domains.
7Figure 10: Google Scholar labels as you select a particular researcher.
Aside from the researcher level labels, the article level labels were extracted from Dimensions to
generate automatic labels for the topics. We did this by first aggregating the articles on the topic
level and then ranking them by the frequency of the categorical labels. By picking the top frequent
labels in each topic, we can generate a series of labels for each topic that is more readable than the
key words from LDA. The topic labels are formulated to be represented here in our UI:
Figure 11: Category labels shown as you hover over each topic on the Sankey diagram.
7 Discussion and Future Work
LDA allowed us to obtain a proportion of topics for each author and it was helpful to understand
where their expertise lays on. We believe that HDSI industry partners will find our tool helpful and
accessible, and will be able to get familiarized with it quickly. The final version tool allows for word
search, topic and researcher selection. When searching for authors it displays the topics they have
written on and their abstract corresponding to the particular topic.
We developed a workflow that will aid future HDSI team members in obtaining the data required
for the tool easily. We also worked on automating the labeling process by obtaining categories from
both Dimensions and Google Scholar.
For future endeavors, we have imagined a different tool that will aid industry partners that might
not be familiar or are having difficulties with the Sankey Diagram tool. Since our current Sankey
dashboard offers many useful features, we wanted to imagine how we could integrate a more UI-
focused easy search tool utilizing a similar design language as the HDSI website while retaining the
core functionality of our dashboard. Thus we have currently conceptualized a demo through Figma
of our faculty exploration tool that would make it very easy for our industry partners to quickly find
what they’re looking for within HDSI’s faculty. The tool is split into three sections: Search by Topic
of Interest, Search by Keywords, and Sankey Diagram. While this is still a work in progress, in our
Figma demo we demonstrate some of the key features that we are further interested in developing
along the line.
8Figure 12: A diagram of the general look of a future Easy Search Tool.
Our main focus was keeping the overall layout as simple as possible for ease of accessibility espe-
cially for those who may not be familiar with topic modeling. Thus our easy search tool resembles a
search engine-like format that matches the current theme of the HDSI website. This search bar tool
will be useful to explore the topics and interests that pertain to HDSI faculty similar to the search by
keyword function within the current dashboard. The resulting information however is laid out in a
more intuitive structure with a profile picture alongside the faculty member’s name, area of research,
and their most relevant publication. Our goal was to provide a more polished experience following
a more modern aesthetic. Additionally, we conceptualized a profile style page that expanded upon
each faculty member’s publications, abstracts, and their contact information.
Figure 13: Faculty profiles including research and previously obtained labels on Easy Search Tool.
9We explored many different pathways of accomplishing this concept, from testing out Observable,
RxJS, and HTML, but with the limited time schedule we decided to put more focus on revamping the
current dashboard. Our original plan was to use a conjunction of Observable and RxJS. Observable is
a data visualization tool that uses minimal conventions to create custom visualizations. We planned
on using Observable in order to rebuild our Sankey diagram to match the aesthetics of the HDSI
website. While we thought RxJS would be ideal to rebuild the “Search by Keywords” and “Search by
Topic of Interest” section since it’s a reactive programming language that makes it easy to compose
asynchronous and event-based programs. Future work would be focused on integrating our easy
search tool on the HDSI website itself which would give access to a wider audience to explore and
play around with topic modeling in a simple to use interface.

Abstract
Halıcıoglu Data Science Institute industry partners are constantly looking for fac-
ulty to work on their projects. In order to make this an easier process, we used
Latent Dirichlet Allocation to find the most representative topics written by HDSI
faculty. We processed the abstracts of their published works in order to run an
LDA model on them. We found the topics most associated with them and created
a tool that effectively shows the connection between the author and topics. We
have made significant improvements to a previously existing tool, mainly labeling
our topics and creating a more user-friendly experience. In order to maintain this
tool functioning, we have generated a workflow that allows for future changes.
We have also made a plan for the creation of an additional tool that allows for an
easy search of faculty.
1 Introduction
The Halıcıoglu Data Science Institute (HDSI) at the University of California, San Diego is dedicated
to the discovery of new methods and training of students and faculty to use data science to solve
problems in the current world. The HDSI has several industry partners that are often searching for
assistance to tackle their daily activities and need experts in different domain areas. Currently, there
are around 55 professors affiliated with HDSI. They all have diverse research interests and have
written numerous papers in their own fields. Our goal is to create a tool that allows HDSI to select
the best fit from their faculty, based on their published work, to aid their industry partners in their
specific endeavors. We will be doing this with Natural Language Processing (NLP) by managing
all the abstracts from the faculty’s published work and organizing them by topics. We will then
discover what is the proportion of papers of each faculty associated with each of the topics and
1draw a relationship between researchers and their most published topics. This will allow HDSI to
personalize recommendations of faculty candidates to their industry partner’s particular job.
We use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to process our texts and obtain the most frequent words
for each topic. Based on this information, a tool was created in the form of a Sankey Diagram where
a specific number of topics can be selected and the relationships between authors and this number
of topics displayed. The topics now have the appropriate labels that indicate the main topic related
to a particular search/author. The version that this paper discusses is what we call version 2.0 of our
tool.
Since this tool will be used by Industry Partners of HDSI, who might not be familiar with Sankey
Diagrams or could have difficulty interacting with it or interpreting the results, we decided to start
the plan to create a companion tool in the form of a search bar, which we will refer to as Easy Faculty
Search Tool. This is just another way of visualizing our LDA topic modeling results.
2 Previous Work
As mentioned above, this is version 2.0 of the Sankey Diagram tool. Our previous work involved
the replication of an already existing tool made by a team of data scientists at HDSI, which was the
foundation for what we present now. What he had done differently in the past, was changing the
number of topics that were used on each iteration of the replication by each member of our team.
Since there was not a published article related to our particular dashboard tool, our replication was
based solely on the code but theoretically supported by a number of articles related to the methods
utilized. Our work was possible with the use of Latent Direct Allocation and based on published
work by D. Blei, A. Ng, and M. Jordan as well as articles by S. Prabhakaran and S. Kapadia.
3 Literature Review
As mentioned in section a., in order to perform the replication of the exploration tool, we used
texts by the aforementioned authors. “Latent Direct Allocation” is a paper by D. Blei, A. Ng and
M. Jordan that explains in detail the origin and process of LDA. It explains the motivations of
modeling text corpora and the techniques used around LDA. The goal of the paper was to find short
descriptions of the members of a collection that enable efficient processing of large collections while
preserving the essential statistical relationships that are useful for basic tasks such as classification,
novelty detection, summarization, and similarity and relevance judgments[1].
In order to understand the step-by-step process of the coding solution to our tool, articles on Towards
Data Science and Machine Learning Eg were consulted. For an understanding of a less theoretical
overview of LDA, we consulted “Topic Modeling in Python: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)” by
S. Kapadia on the Towards Data Science publication. When it comes to the coding process of our
tool, this article helps us understand how to use gensim to perform LDA.
“LDA in Python – How to grid search best topic models?” by S. Prabhakaran explains how to
perform LDA by using one of the most popular machine learning Python libraries: scikit learn.
Both of the articles provide a step-by-step explanation on how to perform the process, therefore the
combination of them was very useful for the present report.
4 Data
In order to create the tool, an analysis on text data was performed. We decided to use only the
abstract portions of published faculty works and perform LDA on this. The data was obtained from
Dimensions, which is a platform that allows for the search and analysis of over 150 million in-
terlinked data items from across the research world. Such data items include publications, grants,
clinical trials, patents, and policy documents. We manually collected each HDSI faculty member’s
researcher ID from Dimensions and from this, we created a csv file. Dimensions’ application pro-
gramming interface, or API, was used in order to collect the abstracts belonging to these particular
researcher IDs beginning in the year 2015. The following image shows the first 4 rows and a sample
of the columns of the data collected.
2Figure 1: Initial dataset obtained by using Dimensions API
Preprocessing the abstracts by using stemming, removing stop words and the gensim simple pre-
process, as well as adding a column containing the actual HDSI faculty member that was included
in the author list of each paper, resulted in a dataset of the following form.
Figure 2: Dataset including Processed abstracts and HDSI authors.
Figure 2 presents the first five rows of the final dataset used, excluding the columns year,authors
(list form), and title.
We were able to perform LDA on the abstract processed column and to subsequently, use the year
and author data to obtain additional information required like the most predominant topic document
and per author.
Abstract data was used since it is a concise summary of each publication, it is easier and more
efficient to process, and it contains words that are representative of the articles. Therefore, the
dataset presented in Figure 2 was enough for us to perform our tasks and obtain our final tool, as
well as to gain a deeper understanding of the overall data obtained from Dimensions.
In order to improve version 1.0 of our tool, we decided to extract fields from both Google Scholar
and Dimensions to use as labeling for authors and topics.
Since Google does not provide any API for their Scholar product, we used Selenium, which is a
web-crawling framework that can be used for data extraction. Even though we faced this challenge,
3we still decided to use Google Scholar because it provides labels under each author that indicate their
general field, as seen in Figure 3. Google Scholar also has information on faculty that Dimensions
does not, as well as some of their missing articles.
Figure 3: Google Scholar profile for an author shows general field labels. In this case, for Dr.
Eldridge they are ‘machine learning’ and ‘artificial intelligence’.
As for the labeling at the article level, we decided to use Dimensions since it provides Research
Categories under each article, as seen below.
(a)
 (b)
Figure 4: Dimensions example of a publication and the fields of research under which it falls under.
5 Methods
For version 1.0 of this tool, we had manually assigned the labeling of topics but had left out Topic
0-Topic n on the search results of the dashboard.
To allow a better understanding of these topics, we used several methods to find appropriate labels
for our results.
1) We scraped the labels on the Google Scholar profiles of faculty in HDSI and gained a histogram
providing a general view of how they are distributed.
4Figure 5: Unique labels gathered from the Google Scholar profiles.
As useful as these Google Scholar unique labels are for understanding in a broader context what
authors publish, we found that they might not be able to provide an explanation as specific as we re-
quire for our current work. For example, “Machine Learning” is a very extensive field; a researcher
can have a focus on supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, or the ap-
plication of a specific algorithm relating to their particular interest area. Therefore, we decided to
expand our work to the second version of labeling.
2) We also gathered labels from the Dimensions API and we found that they provide a better inter-
pretation at the article level. After selecting the more specific labels for the articles, we can better
understand each article’s main contribution. After aggregating the labels on the topic level, we can
then gain a better understanding of the unsupervised results.
Figure 6: Distribution of labels obtained from Dimensions at the article level.
Now, our next step was to clean up the labels that we considered to be too vague and aggregate the
labels to dynamically represent the topics we have from our topic model.
5For version 2.0 of our dashboard, we combined option 1 and option 2 to provide a better user
experience for our search tool. To make our results easier to understand, we provide the article-level
labels as related fields next to our generated topics. This is helpful because it does not replace the
generated words but provides a broader context to them. It is easier for the user to make sense of the
topics without losing the essence of them.
Since the user can also select a particular researcher on our Sankey diagram, we decided to use the
labels obtained from Google Scholar in this section.
Having labels that only work on a specific set of data would not be useful. We worked on improving
our pipeline to be more adaptable to the data stream. Ideally, the data that we are using to generate
our dashboard will be updated once a year, not only to account for new faculty additions but to
include the most recent publications. This means that our code must also produce meaningful results
in a robust manner. Our pipeline was previously tailored to the newer version of data with specific
year thresholds. However, we fixed this issue and improved our data pipeline, making our code
maintainable and easy to modify and expand. Our ideal goal was that as mentioned previously, the
tool will be useful and robust enough to handle any new incoming data.
6 Results
As shown below, our current dashboard has many useful functions that provide a great amount of
information. We are certain that this tool will be exceptionally helpful towards our industry partners
since it has features such as the topic selection where the proprietary topics are listed to demonstrate
the variety of areas of research our HDSI faculty has to offer. As a topic is selected, they will be able
to find a list of the faculty with their respective papers, along with their abstracts, to give a general
sense of what each faculty member is working on.
Figure 7: Topic Selection feature and list of faculty and their related articles
The researcher selection function is another interesting way of discovering where a specific faculty
member’s line of research actually lies. As an example, in Angela Yu’s case, with a 10 topic model,
her papers demonstrate an expansive variety of topics from Applied Mathematics, to Psychology
and Neuroscience.

7 Discussion and Future Work
LDA allowed us to obtain a proportion of topics for each author and it was helpful to understand
where their expertise lays on. We believe that HDSI industry partners will find our tool helpful and
accessible, and will be able to get familiarized with it quickly. The final version tool allows for word
search, topic and researcher selection. When searching for authors it displays the topics they have
written on and their abstract corresponding to the particular topic.
We developed a workflow that will aid future HDSI team members in obtaining the data required
for the tool easily. We also worked on automating the labeling process by obtaining categories from
both Dimensions and Google Scholar.
For future endeavors, we have imagined a different tool that will aid industry partners that might
not be familiar or are having difficulties with the Sankey Diagram tool. Since our current Sankey
dashboard offers many useful features, we wanted to imagine how we could integrate a more UI-
focused easy search tool utilizing a similar design language as the HDSI website while retaining the
core functionality of our dashboard. Thus we have currently conceptualized a demo through Figma
of our faculty exploration tool that would make it very easy for our industry partners to quickly find
what they’re looking for within HDSI’s faculty. The tool is split into three sections: Search by Topic
of Interest, Search by Keywords, and Sankey Diagram. While this is still a work in progress, in our
Figma demo we demonstrate some of the key features that we are further interested in developing
along the line.

Abstract
Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on deep fusion modeling,
which utilize multiple inputs for its inferences and decision
making. By using the data from these inputs, the deep fusion
model benefits from shared information, which is primarily
associated with robustness as these input sources can face
different levels of corruption. Thus, it is highly important
that the deep fusion models used in autonomous vehicles
are robust to corruption, especially to input sources that
are weighted more heavily in different conditions. We ex-
plore a different approach in training the robustness for a
deep fusion model through adversarial training. We train the
model on adversarial examples and evaluate its robustness
against single source noise and other forms of corruption.
Our experimental results show that adversarial training was
effective in improving the robustness of a deep fusion model
object detector against adversarial noise and Gaussian noise
while maintaining performance on clean data. We believe
that this is relevant given the risks that autonomous vehicles
pose to pedestrians - it is important that we ensure the infer-
ences and decisions made by the model are robust against
corruption, especially if it is intentional from outside threats.
1 Introduction
Deep fusion modeling has been used in many applications,
specifically in autonomous vehicles. The key advantage in
this approach is utilizing multiple input sources, in which
they provide shared and complementary information. For
instance, in different environmental conditions such as night-
time or rain, some sensors would be weighted more heavily
than others and can complement the shortcomings of other
input sources. This can be seen in a variety of input sources
for autonomous vehicles such as LIDAR (Light Detection
and Ranging) radars and RGB cameras, which serve different
information about the environment such as distance and de-
tection of other objects. Specifically, LIDAR sensors are more
effective at nighttime in comparison to RGB cameras. Thus,
it is important to ensure that the model can still make robust
predictions when facing single source corruption, especially
in the sensors that are weighted more heavily.
Single source corruption could be the result of physical
damage done to a particular sensor instead of the overallinputs themselves, which emphasizes the importance of guar-
anteeing some robustness from the shared information of
the sensors to compensate for the corruption. If this is not
accounted for, there would be serious consequences for allow-
ing a robust-poor autonomous vehicle to drive on the streets
with actual civilians. Kim, Taewan, and Joydeep Ghosh’s [1]
work addresses this issue through implementing two effi-
cient training algorithms for minimizing their novel loss to
ensure robustness without affecting the performance of the
model on clean data.
While these are effective approaches to improving the
robustness of the model, the motivation behind these solu-
tions was to handle random single source corruption, as the
authors generated random noise through sampling from a
Gaussian distribution as well as downsampling. However,
these models are susceptible to intentional corruption, either
through a third party source or a malfunction within the
system, in which the objects are classified as something else.
This poses a particular threat to safety-critical applications
of ML, notably self-driving cars, as the noise can be intention-
ally optimized on the inputted data to control the decisions
made by the model. In order to explore this motivation in
protecting the deep fusion model systems, we examine ad-
versarial training as a method to train for robustness against
single source corruption.
We train three 3D object detection models, which are
trained on clean data, fine-tuned on adversarial data, and
fine-tuned on random noise data. Then, we compare the
results of these models on clean, adversarial, and random
noise data and evaluate their performance on robustness.

2 Data
For our research, we will use the KITTI (Karlsruhe Institute
of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute) dataset,
a popular benchmark dataset for autonomous driving re-
search. This contains six hours of traffic scenarios, which
were recorded using various modalities such as color stereo
cameras and a Velodyne 3D laser scanner. The scenarios
recorded range between different locations such as rural
streets, freeways, and city roads [5]. For our purposes of the
experiment, we utilize the benchmarks for object detection
tasks, which provides accurate bounding boxes in both 3D
and BEV (Bird’s Eye View) for object types such as cars, cy-
clists, and pedestrians. Figure 1 showcases an example of an
RGB image input from this dataset.
3 Model
We use the AVOD (Aggregate View Object Detection) model,
which is a neural network that uses LIDAR point clouds and
RGB images to deliver real-time object detection in the form
of bounding boxes and labels for objects in an image [6]. It is
structured by two subnetworks, a region proposal network
(RPN) and a second stage detector network, the former gen-
erating 3D object proposals for multiple object classes and
the latter creating accurate oriented 3D bounding boxes and
category classifications for predictions.
The AVOD model has state of the art results on the KITTI
object detection benchmark, making it a great candidate for
our baseline model. Using the same setup as Kim, Taewan,
and Joydeep Ghosh [1], we will train the model solely on the
car class for the object detection tasks and use the feature
pyramid network for feature extraction. Figure 2 highlights
the structure of the AVOD model, in which the blue com-
ponents represent the feature extractors, pink componentsrepresent the region proposal network (RPN), green compo-
nents represent the second stage detector network, and the
yellow components representing the adversarial examples
generation process.
4 Methods
As our motivation for pursuing this research is to handle
intentional single source corruption, we explore adversar-
ial training as an approach to developing robustness. Ad-
versarial training focuses on deceiving the model into mis-
labeling an image by altering the pixel values so that the
changes made to the image are indistinguishable to the hu-
man eye, but recognizable by a model. These mislabeled
images through small perturbations are called adversarial
examples. Figure 3 showcases an example of an image of
a pig perturbed to be misidentified as an airliner, despite
visually appearing the same.
Figure 3. Adversarial Example of a Pig Image [4]
4.1 Adversarial Examples
Since an adversarial example should predict the wrong label,
creating an adversarial example differs from the typical way
of training a classifier. The usual way would be to minimize
the loss of the input’s predicted output to the true output as
represented by
𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑧𝑒
𝜃ℓ(ℎ𝜃(𝑥),𝑦)
2whereℓis the loss function, ℎ𝜃is the model, and 𝑥is the
image input. Given the structure of the AVOD model, we
add the perturbation to the image ROIs (Region of Interest),
which are represented as a feature map instead of directly
manipulating the specific pixel values. This is generated from
the region proposal network (RPN) component of the model.
For the model to make its predictions, it converts the differ-
ent input sources information into feature maps, which can
be interpreted and passed through the convolutional layers
of the model.
However, to create an adversarial example, we instead
want to maximize the loss. The optimization problem to
solve would be
𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑧𝑒
ˆ𝑥ℓ(ℎ𝜃(ˆ𝑥),𝑦)
where ˆ𝑥is the adversarial example we want to maximize
the loss of.
The adversarial example is an image 𝑥with noise𝛿added
to it. This noise, more formally referred to as perturbation,
is a mask of values over each pixel value and is specific to a
given image. Rewriting the optimization problem again to
include𝛿, we get
𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑧𝑒
𝛿∈Δℓ(ℎ𝜃(𝑥+𝛿),𝑦)
where𝛿indicates the valid set of perturbations to add.
We keep𝛿within Δto ensure the perturbed image is still
recognizable to the human-eye. Solving this equation yields
an adversarial example to use for an untargeted attack.
We will implement the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)
as our primary method of solving for the optimization objec-
tive. For FGSM, we take the largest step possible to maximize
the loss so that 𝛿is updated to be as large as possible. To
ensure is still a valid perturbation, 𝛿is constrained to be
within±𝜖. For our approach, we select 𝛿to be a fixed value
as a maximum perturbation. This means the magnitude of 𝛿
is maxed to be 𝜖in FGSM. We then With this constraint, the
equation for updating 𝛿in FGSM becomes the following.
𝛿=𝜖·𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛(𝑔)
This process creates an adversarial example on one image.
For computation speed, we propose using FGSM to produce
an adversarial example. To train a model adversarially, mul-
tiple examples need to be created and the overall loss on the
prediction of all these images need to be minimized.
4.2 Adversarial Training
To train a model against adversarial attacks, we create adver-
sarial examples and include them into the training set. The
loss for predicting all the adversarial examples would needto be minimized. Formally, this optimization problem can be
written as
𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑧𝑒
𝜃1
|𝑆|∑︁
𝑥,𝑦∈𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑧𝑒
ˆ𝑥ℓ(ℎ𝜃(ˆ𝑥),𝑦)
where S represents the input and output pairs and the inner
maximization is the same as the previous section.
This optimization problem, also known as the outer min-
imization problem, can be solved using standard gradient
descent. For our experiment, the model is fine-tuned using
adversarial examples, as it is initially constructed using clean
data. This allows us to focus on a standard baseline model
and compare the effects of introducing adversarial examples
as a means of fine-tuning the initial parameters.
4.3 Proposed Training Algorithm
We will implement our adversarial training algorithm through
developing adversarial examples from the input sources and
optimizing the maximum perturbation added to the data.
Specifically, we plan on perturbing the image input of our
model due to difficulties in translating the noise over to the
LIDAR input [2]. Although we recognize that we can add
perturbation to both input sources, we understand that there
would be a different range of perturbations added. For in-
stance, the noise added to the LIDAR input would be of a
different magnitude and for our exploration, we plan on only
focusing on images.
Initially, we train the model normally given clean data, but
fine-tune the parameters based on the adversarial examples
we provide later. We calculate the best perturbation to add by
using FGSM to the image input for each image ROI (Region
of Interest). We repeat this procedure after initially training
on the clean data so that we can fine-tune the parameters
in the training procedure with adversarial examples. We
illustrate our procedure below:
5 Experimental Results
We test our training algorithm for the 3D and BEV object
detection tasks on the car class of the KITTI dataset and
compare our results to the previous work done by Taewan
Kim and Joydeep Ghosh [1]. These results are based on the
difficulty levels within the dataset, ranging between easy,
medium, and hard. We follow the standard metric of using
an Average Precision (AP) score and reporting the minimum
AP score across all input sources to assess robustness.
We compare three different algorithms and assess their
performance based on the data provided: the AVOD model
trained on (i) clean data, (ii) single source randomly gen-
erated noisy data, and (iii) adversarial examples. For our
training purposes, we opted to use the metrics recorded by
3Figure 4. Pseudocode for Training Algorithm
Taewan Kim and Joydeep Ghosh [1] for the following: AVOD
model trained on (i) clean data and (ii) single source random
noise and the inference on both of these data. Hence, we
focus on the following experimental set-up to generate our
results:
Figure 5. Experimental Set-Up
5.1 Results
From our results, we observed that on the clean test data, the
adversarial model performed slightly worse than the clean
and SSN models but managed to perform slightly better than
the SSN model on SSN data (Figure 6). We find this inter-
esting as the SSN model was trained specifically to handle
random single source generated noise, but our adversarial
model proved to be as robust in handling random noise. Al-
though our adversarial model performed slightly worse on
the clean dataset compared to the other two models, its per-
formance is comparable in that there is not a significant drop
as seen with the adversarial test data for the clean and SSNmodel.
Figure 6. AP Scores of Models on Easy KITTI Validation
Data
We also observed that the adversarial model performed
significantly better than the other two models on adversarial
data. Specifically, we observe a comparable performance of
the adversarial model to the other types of data, clean and
SSN, but when comparing the adversarial inferences of the
clean model and the SSN model, their performances dramat-
ically dropped close to zero. For instance, the clean model
dropped from a performance of 89.33 to 0.0536 from a switch
from clean to adversarial data. Although the clean model had
the highest performance on clean data, it is concerning that
it was not robust at all to handle adversarial corruption. This
indicates that the adversarial attacks were successful against
the deep fusion models and proved their lack of robustness
against adversarial attacks. However, the adversarial model
proved to be robust against these attacks while maintaining
comparable performance on the other benchmarks.

6 Future Work
For further development within this research, we would
like to experiment with different values of ±𝜖to understand
how we can best define the maximum perturbation. For
our approach, we decided to choose a value that added a
small perturbation to each value within the feature map but
not drastic to the extent where the input data itself is com-
pletely manipulated. Additionally, we would like to certify
the robustness of our model, specifically utilizing Chiang,
Ping-yeh, et al.’s Certified Object Detection [3] approach for
verifying robustness of object detectors for two categories
of object detection: bounding-box and label. Their method
involves smoothing based on Gaussian medians as opposed
to Gaussian means and can ensure model robustness against
all possible attackers and would be helpful in certifying that
our model is robust against any generalized attack instead
of just adversarial and random Gaussian noise.7 Conclusion
We explored the importance of developing robustness in
deep fusion modeling as seen in the area of autonomous ve-
hicles. While there has been much research done in making
these models as accurate as they can be, it is imperative that
we focus on ensuring that the model can still make proper
and reasonable inferences when faced with unforeseen cir-
cumstances. Through adversarial training, we were able to
demonstrate that this is a viable approach in improving the
robustness against single source corruption in addition to
previous works. The adversarial model proved to be robust
against both single source Gaussian noise as well as adversar-
ial examples, whereas the other models performed extremely
poorly against adversarial examples. While our models’ per-
formance was comparable on the other validation datasets,
it is important that these models are robust against any at-
tacks, especially those that are intentional like adversarial
5attacks from third parties. We hope our work inspires fur-
ther exploration of using adversarial training in developing
robustness.

Introduction
The medical space is one that is fundamentally sensitive
in terms of its ef fects on the
lives of the patients within it. As a result, the transition into deep learning systems handling more
sensitive information and tasks comes with the worries of those systems being compromised in
some way and those vulnerabilities being responsible for harm to the lives and assets of people.
Research on adversarial attacks shows cases where imperceptible adjustments to data within a
deep learning system can cause said system to make incorrect predictions a majority of the time.
Adversarial attacks are methods used to interfere with deep learning systems- with the
intent of finding ways to misclassify data. These attacks generally come in the form of tar geted
and untar geted attacks. Targeted attacks entail manipulating data to output a desired outcome
after feeding it to a model, while untar geted attacks focus on manipulating data to simply not be
recognized as it’ s correct output.
In order to combat against such adversarial instances, there needs to be robust training
done with these models in order to best protect against the methods that these attacks use on deep
learning systems. In the scope of this paper , we will be looking into the methods of fast gradient
signed method and projected gradient descent, two methods used in adversarial attacks to
maximize loss functions and cause the af fected system to make opposing predictions, in order to
train our models against them and allow for stronger accuracy when faced with adversarial
examples.Background
In the case of our research, we primarily looked into adversarial attacks against
healthcare systems. Healthcare is fundamentally a sensitive space, with patient data being highly
protected and every decision made having a lasting impact on the health of the people that are
involved. As technology advances within this sector , deep learning algorithms are being used for
new tasks, including diagnosing patients with conditions based on viewing medical images such
as photographs, x-rays, and other diagnostic scans. In cases where adversarial examples attack
these deep learning models, the possibilities for misdiagnosis and subsequent fraud and bodily
harm begin to grow (Tjoa & Senthilvelan). With these types of adversarial attacks, we could see
problems such as overprescription or underdiagnosis of conditions among others begin to arise.
As a result, adversarial defenses will need to be implemented into these systems in order to better
protect against these adversarial attacks and the outcomes they produce. We worked on
developing robust models, which will take in data and run adversarial attacks on it in the training
process in order to better train the model against FGSM and PGD attacks in the testing stage. In
the scope of our research, we have taken into account image data from three dif ferent datasets.
One of our sets shows chest x-rays with dif ferent disease conditions as well as healthy
conditions. The goal here is to determine whether there is a disease within the chest x-ray (i.e.
within the lungs, heart, etc.). The next set shows images of human eyes with the intention of
determining whether the eye shows signs of diabetic retinopathy , an eye disease associated with
diabetes. The warning signs for this disease can be seen through “the presence of lesions
associated with the vascular abnormalities caused by the disease” (California Healthcare
Foundation). In the scope of our paper , we will be looking at dif ferentiating between eyes that
have these conditions and eyes that do not. Finally , we have our dermatology dataset, whichfocuses on skin abnormalities and trying to find a skin cancer called melanoma, one that is easily
treatable if detected early but can be deadly if it develops into later stages. The scope of our
project will look into dif ferent images samples of human skin to determine whether or not
melanoma is present in the image.
Generally , these deep learning algorithms are built using neural networks, particularly
convolutional neural networks as is usually the case when working with image inputs (University
of Michigan). Convolutional neural networks, or CNNs for short, work through the usage of
layers that handle functionalities such as decreasing the computational power required to process
the data through dimensionality reduction, extracting dominant features, and flattening in order
to produce the proper classification output (Saha). In the case of our research, we have used the
ResNet model to build our neural network for all three of our image classes. ResNet is a model
that allows us to construct networks that can be up to thousands of layers deep, allowing it to
have stronger performance than other “shallower” models that may suf fer from the “vanishing
gradient” problem. The “vanishing gradient” problem is where “the neural network training
algorithm tries to find weights that bring the loss function to a minimal value, if there are too
many layers, the gradient becomes very small until it disappears, and optimization cannot
continue” (run:ai). For our purposes, we built our ResNet model from the PyT orch library but
with modifications to account for our image sizes and features.
Pipeline
We perform two adversarial training methods on each of our datasets: Projected Gradient
Descent and Fast gradient sign method. In order to test the ef fects of robust training utilizingthese methods, we compare the test accuracy of a model on adversarial attacks. First, we will
explain how these two methods work.
Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)
The Fast Gradient Sign Method is one of the methods that we will experiment with using
for adversarial robust training. Fast gradient sign method is an adversarial method that utilizes
the gradients of a neural network’ s loss in order to af fect the input image in order to maximize
the loss value. Training around this would allow the neural network to account for a seemingly
worst case scenario where losses are maximized, allowing the model to better protect against
adversarial attacks that are imperceptible to humans.
The Fast Gradient Sign Method for adversarial attacks is represented by the equation:
FGSM equation, T ensorflow Documentation
In our use case, we will use a “fairly minor modification to the random initialization for
FGSM adversarial training”, as sourced from Eric Wong, Leslie Rice, J. Zico Kolter in their
paper “Fast is better than free: Revisiting adversarial training”, as we found it to have stronger
performance than a standard FGSM model and to also have comparable performance to
Projected Gradient Descent, which uses multi-step gradients. In addition, this method is also
significantly faster to train and test than Projected Gradient Descent. In the case of the Wong et
al. paper , their modified FGSM model for the CIF AR10 dataset was able to train in 12 minutes
and achieve comparable accuracy to a PGD model that took 4966 minutes to train. We will call
this modified FGSM algorithm “Fast-FGSM” throughout this report.
Projected Gradient Descent
We explore Projected Gradient Descent as a standard for traditional adversarial training
in order to compare the ef fectiveness of the Fast Gradient Sign Method results. Projected
Gradient Descent (PGD) is known to be ef fective in training for adversarial attacks, but can be
computationally expensive to run. Its goal is to solve the inner maximization problem over a
threat model, where threat model refers to the type of attack to be performed on a model (ie
white box attack, black box attack, tar geted vs untar geted attack). This algorithm finds
perturbations that maximize loss of model on input and dif ferentiates itself from FGSM through
its usage of multi-step gradients. The way that the algorithm works from a functionality
standpoint can be expressed by the following pseudocode, which walks through each step that a
PGD attack takes. This algorithm is also represented by the following algorithm.
PGD pseudocode (W ang et al)
PGD Equation, T ensorflow documentation
Based on the use cases for our research, we were able to find that modifications made to
the FGSM algorithm can allow it perform at a similar level to the PGD algorithm. With PGD
being a significantly longer process than FGSM, we decided to focus on our FGSM
implementation for robust training in order to better examine the dif ferences between standard
and robust models.
ResNet Neural Network
For our research, we are using the ResNet neural network model. ResNet is a neural
network that was first introduced by researchers at Microsoft Research in 2015 with a new
architecture called Residual Network (GeeksForGeeks). Neural networks before ResNet suf fered
from an issue known as the “vanishing gradient” problem, which occurs when a neural network
has many layers and the gradient becomes too small to work ef fectively in training (W ang).  With
ResNet being able to handle this issue, we are able to produce deeper neural networks that can
produce stronger deep learning models for our use case. In our case, we use the ResNet model
offered in the PyT orch library for Python. Initially , this model was built to handle the CIF AR-10
dataset which focuses on the classification of tiny images of varying classes. We have modified
this ResNet model to fit the image sizes and classes of our dermatology , ocular , and chest x-ray
images. In our process, we will train a ResNet model with a training dataset for each of our
image classes separately while defining the parameters. Our ResNet model will be a ResNet-18
model, which is 18 layers deep. The architecture for this model is shown in the diagram below:ResNet-18 Architectur e, Resear ch Gate
In this case, we will utilize dif ferent epsilon parameters to determine how robust the model will
be to the FGSM attacks that we run on the code, with an epsilon of 0 indicating a standard model
with no robust training. From here, we can compare each model’ s accuracy against attacks of
varying epsilons as well to determine whether or not robust training is an ef fective
countermeasure to adversarial attacks.
Results
Diabetic Retinopathy
For the purpose of recording our results for diabetic retinopathy , we ran the same FGSM
training model with changing epsilon values. In this case, epsilon represents the coef ficient of the
loss functions as seen in the FGSM equation. Diabetic retinopathy represented our lar gest
dataset, coming in with 10644 images. As a result, our code had to be optimized to run
effectively within the computing resources available to us while also taking into account this
large dataset. As a result, this section was run on algorithms with epsilons 0, 5, and 8 with attack
epsilons of 0, 2, 5, and 8. Epsilon 0 on the training algorithm indicates that the algorithm does
not have robust training while higher epsilons indicate higher levels of robust training. When
looking at the attack epsilon, an epsilon of 0 indicates no adversarial attack while higher epsilons
indicate stronger attacks. Using FGSM, we were able to gauge the following results from those
runs:
Senthilvelan & Tjoa, FGSM Robust T raining Performance on Diabetic Retinopathy Dataset
From what we can see, the models all struggle against adversarial attacks, with a
significant dropof f in performance across the board upon attack epsilons greater than 0.
However , we can see that with higher training epsilons, there is more resistance to the adversarial
attacks relative to those with lower training epsilons.
Dermatology Skin Patches
After performing training using Fast-FGSM on our dataset, we notice our models that had
Epsilon 5 and 8 training epsilons performed relatively consistently against adversarial attacks
between 0 to 9 epochs. Alternatively , we notice the training set with epsilon 0 outputted a lower
accuracy as the epsilon of the adversarial attacks increased; with our takeaway being of a similar
structure to our Diabetic Retinopathy results regarding the ef fectiveness of robustly trained
models on epsilon attacks.
Senthilvelan & Tjoa, FGSM Robust T raining Performance on Dermatology Dataset
Chest X-rays
After performing training using Fast-FGSM on our chest x-ray dataset, we notice a more
prominent ef fect of robust training as the standard model (T raining Epsilon 0) shows a high
accuracy on regular images, which promptly decreases as the adversarial attacks intensify . On
the other hand, we notice our most robustly trained model (T raining Epsilon 8), seems to perform
consistently against the various adversarial attacks, although its initial training accuracy on
non-adversarial images did not perform as well as the standard model. Interestingly , we don’ t
seem to notice a major tradeof f between the robustness of a model and the accuracy compared to
less robust models.
Senthilvelan & Tjoa, FGSM Robust T raining Performance on Chest x-ray Dataset
Conclusion
From our research, we can see that robust training allows for better performance in deep
learning systems in the Fast-FGSM. We can see that the robust training allows the model to be
better prepared for adversarial attacks and that a more robust algorithm could help handle the
cases where ours was unable to detect the adversarial attacks. In our case, we were unable to
explore stronger models due to the computing constraints we faced. However , based on our
findings, we believe that experimenting with dif ferent parameters such as higher training epsilon,
training with more epochs, further optimizing the Fast-FGSM algorithm, using a deeper neural
network, or having access to more training data among other factors may help in further
advancing the performance and ef ficiency of robust training against adversarial attacks in
healthcare. Considering the significant ramifications of adversarial attacks being deployed onto
sensitive healthcare systems, the value of robust training in these systems is very apparent.Works Cited

Finding Commonalities in Misinformative Articles Across Various Topics
By: Maximilian Halvax, Lucas Nguyen, Hwang Min Yu
1.
Abstract
In order to combat the lar ge-scale distribution of misinformation online, We wanted to
develop a way to flag news articles that are misinformative and could potentially mislead the
general public. In addition to flagging news articles, we also wanted to find commonalities
between the misinformation that we found. Were some topics in specific containing more
misleading information than others? How much overlap do these articles have when we break
their content down into TF IDF and see what words carry the most importance when put into
various models detecting misinformation. We wanted to narrow down our models to be trained
on four dif ferent topics: economics, politics, science, and general which is a dataset
encompassing the three previous topics. We Found that general included the most overlap
overall, while the topics themselves, while mostly dif ferent from the other specific topics, had
certain models that still put emphasis on similar words, indicating a possible pattern of
misinformative language in these articles. We believe, from these results, that we can find a
pattern that could direct further investigation into how misinformation is written and distributed
online.
2.
Introduction to the dataset:
Our data is collected from
Simon Fraser University's
fake news research
where we use
the datasets containing Snopes, Politifact, and Emer gent.info articles of varying real and fake
news from 2010 to 2018. We took articles from each dataset to create a new dataset that contains
real and fake news for specific genres of news. We gathered news about 100 data for each
economic, political, and scientific topic from the Snopes, Politifact, and Emer gent.info datasets2
to use as our training dataset. The dataset includes both misinformation and non-misinformation.
We also created a dataset mixed with the topics we are using as our testing dataset. Our plan with
these datasets is to find commonalities of misinformation across dif ferent topics. To do this, we
are training our models based on set genres and then testing the results on a set of data with
varying genres of news.
3.
Identify predictive tasks:
For our research, we are using our training dataset to predict whether a random article,
regardless of the genre, is misinformative or not. We will train our models so that it learns the
commonalities of misinformation for a set topic. Then we will test our findings onto a random
article to see if our model can accurately predict whether that article is misinformative or not. We
use the scores of the Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier , and SVM to
test our models’  accuracies. In addition to examining accuracies, we will look at the intersection
of a list of words that each model deems most important to determine if an article is
misinformative, this will help figure out which topics have common indicators of
misinformation. After our models make a prediction on a random genre article, we want to
examine dif ferences of misinformation across dif ferent genres of news.
4.
Describe your models and techniques
We use natural language processing, NLP , to train our models from the texts of articles.
We tested out multiple NLP  techniques. One technique we used was a bag of words’  n-grams.
We ended up using a NLP’ s technique called term frequency and inverse document frequency ,
TF-IDF , to score the words from articles for the most important words of each topic we were
testing. We input the scores from TF-IDF through our models for prediction. As our final result,3
we get an accuracy , precision, and recall score to determine how well our models predicted
articles as misinformative or not.
The following models are the models we used in our replication project in the previous
quarter . We use these models since we are familiar with them. Some models have been removed,
that we feel are not as useful for our task.
The Decision Tree model utilizes the structure of a tree to classify data. It has branches
and leaves which are the classified data path. The Decision Tree model makes a prediction based
on the learnings of the decision rules from resulting features of data. We use sklearn for our
Decision Tree classifier since it has the option to set the max depth. Having this option allows us
to shorten the time for processing this model.
Binary Logistic Regression utilizes linear regression function which is modified to scale
any data a value in between 0 and 1. The value assigned is the probability of the prediction
belonging to class 1 or 0. We use sklearn implementation of Logistic Regression since linear
regression is regularized to prevent overfitting.
The Random Forest Classifier is an estimator . The classifier fits multiple decision trees
on smaller sub-samples of the dataset to get a dif ferent approach compared to a regular decision
tree. Additionally , the Random Forest Classifier averages result to control overfitting and
improve the accuracy of predictions.
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) searches a hyperplane in N-dimensional space to
classify particular data points from a dataset. The SVM has updatable gradients for the weights
when classifying data points. We use sklearn’ s SVM since it is regularized to prevent overfitting.

Literature4
For some parts of our project, we relied on some formatting and testing of a
covid
misinformation report
by Sajad Dadgar , titled A COVID-19 misinformation detection system on
twitter using network & content mining perspective. We utilized some preprocessing utilities as
well as what models to focus on for our news misinformation detection. In addition, we
implemented his grid search method for finding optimal parameters for the appropriate models.
Finally , we looked at his testing methods and how to display results for finding what model to
use. While these were first geared towards twitter posts with mainly lower amounts of
text/characters for analysis, we found that it could help with denser articles that contain more
details on the subject at hand.
6.
Exploratory Data Analysis
Since our goal was to see if there were themes to the misinformation of each topic, we
looked at what words would be the most important in deciding between informative and
misinformative. We used a Word Cloud figure to visualize the important words of informative
and misinformative articles across each topic of study . For consistency , we used logistic
regression as our base model for determining these clouds.
5
Figure 1: Word Cloud of Most Important Words in Informative Science Articles
Figure 1 is the word cloud of most important words for informative science articles. The
most interesting words of informative science's word cloud are Lexus, chip, honey , and Ukraine.
This result is interesting because it shows that informative science articles mainly focus on the
subject of the article.
Figure 2: Word Cloud of Most Important Words in Misinformative Science Articles
Figure 2 is the word cloud of most important words for misinformative science articles.
The most interesting words that are visible by this word cloud are part, time, well, and more.
These words are interesting because they focus on the descriptions to the subject compared to the
focus on the subject of the informative science articles.
6
Figure 3: Word Cloud of Most Important Words in Informative Economic Articles
Figure 3 is the word cloud of most important words for informative economic articles.
The most interesting words of informative economy's word cloud are been, when, had, and
without. This result is dif ferent compared to informative science articles where its main focus
was the subject of the article. Economic informative article focuses more on occasions.
Figure 4: Word Cloud of Most Important Words in Misinformative Economic Articles
7
Figure 4 is the word cloud of most important words for misinformative economic articles.
The most interesting words of misinformative economy's word cloud are care, from, elected, and
on. This result focuses a lot more on actions rather than the subject of the article.
Figure 5: Word Cloud of Most Important Words in Informative Political Articles
Figure 5 is the word cloud of most important words for informative political articles. The
most interesting words of informative politics's word cloud are Florida, Maher , Romney , and
King. This result is a similar case to informative science article's results. There is more focus on
the subject of the article.
8
Figure 6: Word Cloud of Most Important Words in Misinformative Political Articles
Figure 6 is the word cloud of most important words for misinformative political articles.
The most interesting words of misinformative politics's word cloud are has, was, more, told, and
did. This result is similar to misinformative economic article's results. There is more focus on the
action rather than the subject of the article.
Figure 7: Word Cloud of Most Important Words in Informative Topics Combined Articles
9
Figure 7 is the word cloud of most important words for informative articles with the
topics science, economy , and politics all combined. The most interesting words for this word
cloud are Covid, Romney , billion, city , and wealth. The result is interesting since there is a
mixture of focus on the subject and description of the subject.
Figure 8: Word Cloud of Most Important Words in Misinformative Topics Combined Articles
Figure 8 is the word cloud of most important words for misinformative articles with the
topics science, economy , and politics all combined. The most interesting words for this word
cloud are high, most, nearly , several, and more. This result is interesting because these
descriptive words are mostly used to describe more of something. Based on the nature of
misinformation, it could be hypothesized that misinformative articles use these kinds of
descriptive words to exaggerate the subject of its article.

Figure 13: Table of Top 5 Intersections by Topics and models
Next we wanted to examine the overlap of sets of important words between models. We
did this by creating a set of the keys returned by our models as being the 500 most important
words in determining if an article is misinformative or not. While turning these keys and
coefficients into simple sets of keys removes some of the magnitude of these words, it still lets us
examine which articles have similar “queues” as to whether they are misinformative or not.
Figure 13 shows the intersections. Expectantly , we found the general models had the most
overlap. What was interesting was that Decision Tree models maintained very similar word
coefficients across topics. For specific topics, it seems that Politics and Economics have higher12
intersection rates with Science being lower overall. This is likely due to the unique wording of
science documents that might make it easy to mislead the reader , whereas economic and political
articles will use well known, common words to mislead the reader .
With our results, we can not make a definite conclusion. There were limitations to the
project that we could not handle. The major limitation for our project is the nature of human
language. There are many connotations and hidden meanings behind sentences in the human
language that computers have a hard time processing. It is dif ficult for the computer to process
the human language that is constantly evolving everyday . This limitation makes it dif ficult to get
an accurate score for perfect predictions of articles being misinformative. But, we found a good
direction for the project to go of f of. Our process and methods led us to results that are
satisfactory despite the low scores. Some good ideas for similar future projects are usage of deep
learning models, usage of structure of text instead of words, and more data for computation.
Hopefully , our research will help similar future projects improve the predictions of
misinformative articles.13

1 Abstract
Musicians often trend on social media for various reasons but in recent years, there has been a rise
in musicians being “canceled” for committing offensive or socially unacceptable behavior. Due to
the wide accessibility of social media, the masses are able to hold accountable musicians for their
actions through “cancel culture”, a form of modern ostracism. Twitter has become a well-known
platform for “cancel culture” as users can easily spread hashtags and see what’s trending, which
also has the potential to facilitate the spread of toxicity. We analyze how public sentiment towards
canceled musicians on Twitter changes in respect to the type of issue they were canceled for, their
background, and the strength of their parasocial relationship with their fans. Through our research,
we aim to determine whether cancel culture on Twitter could lead to an increase in toxicity towards
a canceled individual.
2 Introduction
Every so often, a public figure or celebrity would trend on Twitter over behavior that the general
public would consider offensive or socially unacceptable by today’s standards. From politics to
Hollywood to the music industry, all kinds of public figures have been called out and criticized for
such behavior by the masses. This form of   modern ostracism is known as “cancel culture”, in which
the masses attempt to call out and boycott an individual in response to problematic remarks or
ideologies that they have expressed. This online phenomenon has resulted in celebrities facing real
life repercussions. For example, the world renown rapper, Travis Scott recently faced backlash for
lack of crowd control which results in multiple deaths and injuries (Lamarre). Due to the public
uproar, multiple lawsuits were filed against Scott and many organizers canceled his upcoming
performances. His music also struggled to find air time on the radio. Another example is R. Kelly,
an American singer and songwriter, who was accused for sexually assualting minors. In fact, R.
Kelly was arrested for 10 counts for sexual asualting four women. The hashtag “#MuteRKelly”,
however, began trending on Twitter when “Survingn R. Kelly”, an investigative series began airing
on the US network Lifetime. The hashtag was pushing for R. Kelly songs to be removed from radio
and music applications (Associated Press).
3 Problem Statement and Objectives
To investigate how cancel culture affects the overall public perception of musicians on Twitter,
our main research question is the following: among English-speaking Twitter users, how does their
sentiment towards canceled musicians change over time? As a result of getting canceled, we believe
that there will be an overall increase in toxicity and negativity in terms of public sentiment on
1Twitter towards the canceled individual. To understand the nuances and quantify the effect of
cancel culture on public figures, we will be conducting case studies on six individuals from three
different genres within the music industry, using Twitter as our main source and platform. To assist
our main investigation, we ask three sub-research questions:
• RQ1: How does sentiment differ over time based on the type of issue the individual was
canceled for?
• RQ2: How does sentiment differ based on the individual’s gender and the genre they cater
to?
• RQ3: How does sentiment differ for individuals with and without fans that have a strong
parasocial connection to the individual?
4 Literature Review
Many social media platforms have been criticized for not doing enough to mitigate or reduce the
spread of misinformation and hate speech within online communities. In response to such criticism,
social media platforms employed the idea of deplatforming, where the platform temporarily or
permanently bans an influential figure’s account for not complying with their guidelines (Fiesler
et al.). However, deplatforming or banning moderate entire communities on Reddit, Facebook or
Twitter, however, is not a widespread tool for content moderation. This is because such action
begins to raise questions about freedom of expression and speech. Apart from the human rights
perspective, deplatforming influential figures could result in a monetary deficit because, as a result,
supporters of the figure may be inclined to stop using the platform. Unfortunately, due to this,
the method of boycotting an influential figure via deplatforming only occurs in extreme cases.
However, the rise of social media has given the opportunity to many marginalized groups to make
an impact by shedding light on issues that are overlooked by the majority. This ability propelled the
phenomenon of “cancel culture”, where the public boycotts an individual figure with the intention
of ending the public figure’s career or pressing for disciplinary action (Velasco).
Although “cancel culture” is a relatively new phenomenon, the concept has been employed by the
public for years. In the 2010s, the term “call-out culture” had roots in online platforms when it was
used to describe Tumblr fandoms calling out blogs (Romano). Prior to that, “call-out culture” was a
technique commonly utilized through other mediums of free speech during the civil rights movement
(Clark). However, due to the global nature of social media platforms, like Twitter, cancel culture has
become more prominent and impactful than before. As mentioned above, many entertainers, such
as R.Kelly, Kanye West, Scarlett Johanssen, have been targeted and held accountable through this
process. Entertainers usually face criticism from the public for issues that are “fueled by politically
progressive social media” (Romano). Some notable examples are statements discriminating against
African Americans or the LGBTQ+ community or actions violating women’s rights.
Although more marginalized groups are being heard, the main question remains: is cancel culture
effective? The public strives to hold a public figure accountable through pushing for a tangible
effect on a public figure’s career. However, as indicated in the Travis Scott example, there are
some immediate setbacks that occur but it is not detrimental. In fact, at the very least, the
artists will continue to collect revenue from streaming platforms. Even in the most extreme cases,
like Louis C.K., who faced sexual misconduct allegations, only had a 10 month career hiatus
(Romano). Moreover, he returned to sold-out stand-up comedy shows. Similarly, R. Kelly saw
increase in number of music streams despite facing sexual assault cases (Romano). Due to the
possible controversies this online phenomenon may cause, it is important to analyze and understand
2the impact or nuances of “cancel culture” public figures. We used the paper ‘Evaluating the
Effectiveness of Deplatforming as a Moderation Strategy on Twitter, as a guide for determining the
effectiveness of cancel culture (Jhaver et al). We will specifically focus on exploring how the public
sentiment is altered towards an entertainer, specifically musicians, in response to their controversy.
5 Data
We collected data from three different music genres: K-pop, Hip-Hop, and Pop. For each music
genre, we chose one male and one female music artist who has gotten canceled as well as one male
and female artist who have not had any controversies that they got canceled for to act as our control
group. Each individual that we have chosen also has a Twitter account that is run by themselves
and/or their social media team.
5.1 Background on Case Studies
For K-pop, our two canceled individuals were NCT and WayV’s Lucas and Aespa’s Giselle. After
allegations from alleged former girlfriends of gaslighting and cheating, Lucas was called out and
then apologized for such behavior two days after the allegations appeared (Kim). As of March 2022,
Lucas still remains on hiatus. Giselle was called out on Twitter for lip-syncing a racial slur from
American R&B artist SZA’s track “Love Galore” in a behind-the-scenes video (Kim). Giselle also
apologized a few days after the incident occured. For our control individuals for the K-pop genre,
we chose NCT and NCT Dream’s Jaemin and ITZY’s Ryujin. In choosing our control individuals
for this genre, we chose individuals that were part of groups that debuted or were formed within
the same time frame as the groups that the canceled individuals are part of and their respective
groups have at least over a million Twitter followers on their official Twitter accounts. It is also
important to note that although Lucas and Jaemin are both members of boy group NCT, they
work under different sub-units or groups as Lucas is a member of WayV and Jaemin is a member
of NCT Dream. This means that they are not directly associated with each other as they do not
work together on a regular basis as part of the same sub-unit/group. Therefore, it is highly unlikely
that the reputation of one would affect the other’s reputation.
The next group of artists we analyzed were Western hip hop artists. In this group, the two
canceled artists were DaBaby and Nicki Minaj. During a festival concert in July of 2021, DaBaby
made some remarks to the crowd that were homophobic. After that concert, the controversy went
mainstream while many festivals and brands dropped DaBaby (Chan). Nicki Minaj faced backlash
after she tweeted vaccine misinformation after being asked her vaccination status (Romano). This
controversy occurred in September of 2021 while the COVID-19 pandemic was still affecting many
around the world. For the control artists in the hip hop group, we chose Lil Baby and Saweetie.
The main criteria for these artists were if they had a similar following or presence as the canceled
individuals and didn’t experience cancellation from controversies. Lil Baby and DaBaby have a
similar number of Twitter followers at 6.7 and 4.4 million respectively. However, Nicki Minaj is the
most followed female hip hop artist on Twitter by a large margin at 23.7 million followers. For our
female control artist, we chose Saweetie as we felt she had cultivated a similar following to Nicki
Minaj through her music and online presence.
The third group of artists we analyzed were Western pop artists. Two individuals who faced
controversy in this genre were Doja Cat and Zayn Malik. Around the end of May 2020, the hashtag
“#DojaCatIsOverParty” began circulating on Twitter since Doja Cat’s 2015 song “Dindu Nuffin”
resurfaced (France). The term, “Dindu Nuffin”, is recognized as ‘a racial slur used to mock victims
3of police brutality’ (France). Following this, more racist allegations emerged suggesting that Doja
Cat was contributing to racist conservations on online chat rooms years prior. In response to the
controversy, Doja Cat apologized and explained the reasoning behind her actions in an Instagram
post, which is now deleted. Zayn Malik recently faced some backlash due to physical assault
allegations made by his mother-in-law, Yolanda Hadid. On October 28 2021, TMZ reported that
Yolanda Hadid filed a police report against Zayn for domestic violence (Pham). As a result, Zayn
was required to pay fines, complete 90 day probation, and attend anger management classes (Pham).
For the Western Pop control artists, we have chosen Adele and Harry Styles. As mentioned above,
the main criteria for our control artists is to have a similar following or presence to our canceled
artists. Adele is a strong female pop artist with 27.2 million followers on Twitter. Although
her career has been longer and her following is significantly greater than Doja Cat’s 4.2 million
followers, both artists hold a similar presence in the media through their music today. Both Doja
and Adele have achieved chart topper hits in this year, making them both equally relevant in the
current pop industry. In regards to Harry Styles and Zayn Malik, both have a similar number
of followers on Twitter (Harry Styles - 37.4 million and Zayn Malik - 31 million). In addition,
their industry presence is also identical since they started their careers together in boy group One
Direction. Moreover, Harry and Zayn were both equally influential and popular artists through
their independent music post One Direction, making them ideal complements.
5.2 Methodology for T weet Collection
We used the Twitter API to scrape tweets from Twitter relating to each individual. In order
to observe the change in public sentiment over time, we decided to collect tweets six months
before and after the date of an artist’s cancellation. For our control artists, we used the date of
cancellation from their coressponding canceled counterpart to gather tweets for them. For each
artist, we generated a list of related hashtags and keywords that was used to collect tweets relating
to the artist and their controversy. For each tweet, we gathered information on the date the tweet
was created, author id, tweet id, and the text of the tweet itself. Below we have presented a table
displaying the hashtags and keywords we included for each query along with the date of cancellation
and the number of initial tweets we collated.

6 Methods
6.1 Sentiment Analysis APIs
Initially, we looked at three sentiment analysis tools: Google Perspective, Vader, and TextBlob, in
order to analyze the sentiment in our tweet datasets. However, upon conducting our preliminary
analysis and EDA, we were not able to gather any meaningful results from Vader and Textblob
that were not already evident through our results with the Google Perspective API. Therefore, we
eventually decided to only use Google Perspective for our final analysis.
Using the Google Perspective API, we calculated the probability that each tweet in our datasets
would be perceived as being the following attributes: toxic, severely toxic, an insult, and containing
profanity. The difference between toxic and severely toxic is that the severe toxicity attribute is
less sensitive to milder forms of toxicity, such as text that contains profanity used in a positive
case. Since we are focusing on sentiment among English-speaking Twitter users, we specified that
we would be using the English language while using the Perspective API. Therefore, any tweets
that were not recognized as being primarily written in English by the API were excluded from
our final datasets. In choosing which attributes we would use for our analysis, we chose the
severe toxicity and insult probability attributes. Our preliminary results showed that toxicity and
severe toxicity showed similar trends. Insult and profanity also shared similar trends with each
other. Therefore, we narrowed it down to only using severe toxicity and insult probability scores to
minimize redundancy in our final results and because we believed that these two attributes would
be the best for analyzing change in toxicity over time.
6.2 RQ1: Type of Issue for Cancellation
The first research question we explored was how sentiment differed over time based on the type of
subject the artist is “canceled” for. The six case studies, we present, fall into three different cate-
gories: discrimination against marginalized groups, abuse allegations, and misinformation. These
7categories were defined using our domain knowledge and research surrounding the detail of each con-
troversy. In the discrimination against marginalized class, we have Doja Cat, Giselle, and Dababy.
Both Doja Cat and Giselle received harsh criticism for singing terms which are frequently utilized
to degrade the African American community. Similarly, Dababy faced backlash for making homo-
phobic remarks which disrespected the LGBTQ+ community. Next, in the abuse allegation class,
we have Zayn Malik and Lucas. Zayn Malik made headlines for physically assaulting his mother-
in-law and Lucas faced allegations for emotional abuse from former alleged girlfriends. In the final
misinformation class, we have Nicki Minaj’s controversy for COVID-19 vaccine misinformation.
T able 3. Categories of Cancellation for Canceled Artists
Group Artist Names
Discrimination Towards Marginalized Groups Giselle, DaBaby, Doja Cat
Abuse Allegations Lucas, Zayn Malik
Misinformation Nicki Minaj
To test the impact the type of conflict has on public sentiment, we conduct two types of analysis:
qualitative and quantitative. For the qualitative analysis, we compared the words with the highest
frequency before and after the controversy. We started by grouping the data from the artists
in each category and compiled the text for every tweet in each group. To preprocess our text
data, we removed all urls and standardized the text by converting it to lowercase. In addition, we
removed any “stop words” from the tweets. Stop words are the common words, such as prepositions,
conjunctions, and pronouns, that do not add much information or context to a piece of writing.
After cleaning our text data, we were able to generate a table with the number of occurrences
for every word within each category. Based on these results, we will be able to determine which
category promoted more dialogue surrounding the conflict.
In regards to the quantitative analysis, for each category, we compared the severe toxicity and insult
levels before and after the date of the controversy. For the preprocessing of our quantitative data,
we initiated by removing any invalid severe toxicity and insult score that equaled 1000. A score of
1000 indicates that the tweet was not recognized by the API. We then converted all the values with
the ‘created_at’ column to a datetime object and eliminated tweets that did not fall within the
six months of the controversy date. Finally, we generated a ‘days_cancel’ column which presented
the difference in the number of days the tweet was created to the controversy. To proceed with our
analysis, we grouped the processed data by ‘days_cancel’ and computed the rolling average for the
severe toxicity and insult score. In order to recognize any trends, we plotted the final data on a
line plot which shows the change in sentiment for each category over time.
6.3 RQ2: Background of Musician
The background of the artists we researched was another aspect that we were interested in determin-
ing its influence on sentiment after cancellation. The differences between each artists’ background,
we believe, may influence the severity of sentiment, as well as the duration of sentiment during
canceling. In order to determine whether or not the background of an artist has an effect on the
sentiment they receive after being canceled, we created two different groups to look at. The first
grouping of artists is based on the genre of music they’re in. The genres that our artists fall into
are K-pop, hip-hop, and Western pop. The second grouping of artists is based on sex, comparing
female artists with male artists. The metric we used to compare artists in these groupings is de-
8termining the number of days after cancellation it takes for the median sentiment level to return
to pre-controversy levels.
We dropped all of the control artists from these groups because the control artists weren’t necessary
for the analysis. We were only interested in how background affects the change in sentiment after
getting canceled.
After sorting the artists for the groups in each category, we took the sentiment indicators (severe
toxicity and insult levels) over time for each artist within the group and grouped by the number of
days before and after controversy. The aggregate function we used on the sentiment indicators is
median. In short, we calculated the median severe toxicity and insult levels for each group within
genre and sex over the entire period of tweets we collected.
Next, we plot out the grouped data for the categories to visualize the median indicator levels for
the groups against each other. In order to quantify the effect of the chart, we used the metric
of determining the number of days after controversy until the median sentiment indicator levels
returned to pre-controversy levels. We calculated this metric by taking the sentiment indicator
level at day 0 or the day of the controversy and finding the first instance of the indicator level being
below the day 0 level after the controversy has happened. For each group, we calculated this metric
and compared it to other groups within the same category to determine if there is a difference for
that background category.
6.4 RQ3: Parasocial Relationships
Parasocial relationships are one-sided relationships in which an individual develops illusions of
intimacy with another individual, usually a media personality, as a result of repeated interactions
between the two of them (Wikipedia). For example, a fan who has followed an artist for a period
of time and has learnt enough about them to develop a sense of loyalty might feel that they
have a personal connection with the artist. Depending on the strength of the relationship, media
personalities can have strong influence over their audiences as evident with fandoms or fan bases
like BTS’s ARMYs or Taylor Swift’s Swifties. To determine which artists have fan bases that
share either a strong or weak parasocial relationship with the artist, we used two metrics: total
mean engagement and fandom ratio. For the engagement metric, we collected every tweet an artist
posted 6 months before and after their cancellation date on their official Twitter account. We
then calculated the total mean engagement by taking the sum of the mean number of retweets,
quote tweets, likes, and replies across all artist’s tweets. To calculate the fandom ratio, we used
our previous tweet datasets gathered according to an artist’s related hashtags and keywords. Then
for each artist, we calculated the total amount of tweets that contained at least one of the artist’s
fandom names divided by the total number of tweets in that artist’s tweet dataset.

We then grouped them into either strong or weak parasocial relationships based on whether the
artist reached above or below a certain threshold for each metric, in which our thresholds were
determined based on our metric values and our own domain knowledge. For the total mean en-
gagement, the cutoff threshold was 20,000 and for the fandom ratio, the cutoff threshold was 0.05.
To be categorized as having a strong parasocial relationship, the artist’s total mean engagement
and fandom ratio values would both have to be greater than or equal to its respective threshold.
On the other hand, those who are unable to reach above both thresholds are then categorized as
having a weak parasocial relationship. For example, Zayn Malik meets the threshold for total mean
engagement as ~360,000 > 50,000 but does not meet the threshold for the fandom ratio metric as
0.003 < 0.05, so he was categorized as having a weak parasocial relationship.

7.1 RQ1: Type of Issue for Cancellation
To investigate how sentiment changes over time based on the type of issue an artist was canceled
for, we preprocessed our discrimination, abuse, and misinformation grouped datasets by calculating
the mean severe toxicity and insult score for each date. We then applied a rolling median over an
interval of 14 days on the processed data to smoothen the visualization in order to recognize the
trend.
Figure 1: Most Common Words Before
Cancellation For Discrimination GroupFigure 2: Most Common Words After
Cancellation For Discrimination Group
The bar charts comparing the word frequency show that discrimination towards marginalized groups
(specifically towards the African American community) promotes more conservation or dialogue
surrounding the controversy in comparison to the abuse and misinformation category. This is evi-
dent since the “Most Common Words After Cancellation For Discrimination Issue Group” presents
“black” at the 7th most frequent word and the word ‘racist’ also appears within the top 50 most
common words post cancellation. However, both the abuse and misinformation graphs did not
display any common words related to the conflict in question following the controversy.

When looking at how the subject of the controversy affects sentiment, the artists we present who
are canceled for discrimination towards marginalized groups promote higher negative sentiment
compared to our artists with issues relating to abuse and misinformation. All groups have an initial
spike immediately after the controversy. However, the discrimination category has a slightly large
spike in severe toxicity and two more spikes are seen around the 40 and 90 day mark. In addition,
when comparing the change in median severe toxicity score before and after the controversy, we
observe the following: +1.6% increase for misinformation, +15.6% increase for discrimination, and
-1.6% increase for abuse.
The trend is not as distinct when looking at the insult level plot, however, it does provide a
similar result. Once again, discrimination exhibits the largest spike after the controversy. Although
misinformation and discrimination follow a similar trend in insults levels post the controversy,
discrimination still displays a slight increase in negative sentiment as another spike is recognized
around the 100 day mark. Moreover, when comparing the change in median insult score before
and after the controversy, we observe the following: +2.7% increase for misinformation, +14.5%
increase for discrimination, and -0.93% increase for abuse.
7.2 RQ2: Background of Musician
For the second subquestion measuring the effect of background on sentiment, we grouped artists
into different genres and sex, and compared the differences in severity and length of sentiment by
taking the median sentiment level for each group.

Comparing different genres to each other, hip-hop stands out. For median severe toxicity levels, hip
hop artists took 30 days for the severe toxicity to return to the level it was at before controversy.
K-pop artists took 18 days and pop artists took 1 day (Table 9). For median insult levels, hip hop
artists took 35 days, K-pop artists took 26 days, and pop artists took 18 days to return to pre-
controversy insult levels (Table 10). From the data, hip-hop artists seem to undergo a prolonged
negative effect from cancellation compared to our other genres. Also, from our visualizations on
genre severe toxicity and insult levels, canceled hip hop artists experience a more severe change in
toxic sentiment compared to other genres as both plots have an extremely sharp peak in sentiment
levels. Median hip-hop severe toxicity levels go from 0.176 to around 0.300 (Figure 5) while median
hip-hop insult levels go from 0.145 to 0.220 immediately after controversy (Figure 6).

Our results for grouping by sex show that canceled female artists experience a greater backlash in
response to controversy but for a much shorter period of time. Canceled male artists’ sentiment
levels returned to normal/pre-controversy levels 71 days after controversy while female artists took
13 days for severe toxicity and 18 days for insult levels to return to normal (Table 11, 12). Male
artists experienced a much longer duration of the effect from cancellation compared to female artists.
However, female artists sustain a greater level of negative sentiment for the entire time period of
tweets we collected and have a sharper and more drastic peak after being canceled (Figure 7, 8).
To conclude, genre and sex seem to make a difference in the length and severity of the sentiment
for canceled artists. Our canceled hip hop artists experienced longer and more drastic differences
in sentiment over the period of being canceled compared to k-pop and pop artists. Our male artists
who were canceled experienced the effects of being canceled for a much longer period of time than
female artists, but female artists experience a more drastic effect and have higher toxic sentiment
overall.
7.3 RQ3: Parasocial Relationships
To investigate how sentiment changes over time based on the strength of a canceled artist’s paraso-
cial relationship with their fans, we preprocessed our strong and weak grouped datasets by first
calculating the mean severe toxicity and insult probability score for each date. We then applied a
rolling median over an interval of 14 days on the transformed data to facilitate the observation of
long-term trends.
Figure 9: Change in Median Severe Toxicity
Score Over TimeFigure 10: Change in Median Insult Score
Over Time
Based on both figures, we can see that artists that have a strong parasocial relationship with their
14fans tend to have reduced negative sentiment overall compared to artists with a weak parasocial
relationship. Figure 9 and Figure 10 both show a dramatic increase in median severe toxicity and
insult score directly after the artist’s cancellation. Both strong and weak parasocial groups also
experience an increase in negative sentiment after 100 days, which is possibly due to events such as
the controversy resurfacing. However, the weak parasocial group shows a more significant increase
that is comparable to its initial spike seen directly after cancellation.

Median Severe Toxicity Score 0.1388 0.1606
Median Insult Score 0.1744 0.2033
In terms of how sentiment has changed compared to before cancellation, the median severe toxicity
score increased by +4.5% for the strong group and +7.4% for the weak group after cancellation
(Table 13, 14). The median insult score increased by +5.5% for the strong group and +11.5%
for the weak group (Table 13, 14). Therefore, we can see that there is a slight percent increase
in severe toxicity and insult scores for both groups after cancellation. When comparing our weak
parasocial group against our strong parasocial group, there is also a slight positive difference in
percent increase with a +2.9% difference for severe toxicity and +6% for insults. This supports
that artists with a weak parasocial relationship experience slightly increased toxicity overall after
cancellation compared to those with a strong parasocial relationship.
8 Discussion
In analyzing how sentiment towards canceled musicians changes over time, we can conclude that
there is an overall increase in negative and toxic sentiment after cancellation. However, the duration
of such negative sentiment towards a canceled artist appears to be short-term.
Depending on the severity of the issue, we believe this could affect the intensity of negative sentiment
towards a canceled artist. Our research shows that artists canceled for discrimination against a
marginalized group tended to experience greater backlash compared to artists canceled for abuse or
misinformation. It was unexpected that artists canceled for abuse allegations did not demonstrate
higher levels of toxicity. However, due to the sensitivity of the topic as well as other factors such
as the strength of the artist’s parasocial relationship with their fans, it is possible these reasons are
why conversations about these individuals were less toxic than we expected.
Given that canceled artists’ backgrounds also could affect sentiment, we analyze how the genre
of music they cater to and their sex could affect sentiment after cancellation. We found that
hip-hop artists experienced a higher rise in negative sentiment and took the longest to return to
15pre-controversy median severe toxicity and insult levels compared to K-pop and Western pop. The
huge spike in negative sentiment for hip-hop artists was unexpected, but is likely influenced by
issues they were canceled for, their target audience, and their general reputation in the eyes of the
public. In terms of sex, male artists took longer to return to pre-controversy median sentiment
levels, but female artists had a more drastic rise and a greater overall average in negative sentiment
after cancellation. This suggests that there might be a gender imbalance with Twitter cancel culture
in which an artist’s sex could affect the intensity of negative sentiment they feel towards a canceled
artist.
The strength of a canceled artists’ parasocial relationship can also affect sentiment as we found
that artists who have a strong parasocial relationship with their fans tend to experience less tox-
icity overall. Fans who have a strong parasocial relationship with an artist might feel a sense of
loyalty towards them. This suggests that if fans feel loyal towards an artist, they might be more
compelled to defend them and suppress as much negativity surrounding them as possible after the
artist’s cancellation. Especially considering how fans of WayV’s Lucas were mass tweeting hashtags
such as #WELOVEYOULUCAS or #LUCASBESTBOY as signs of support after his controversy
(Figure 12), it appears that the strength of an artist’s parasocial relationship with their fanbase
can significantly influence public sentiment surrounding them.
After conducting our research, there are several limitations that we would like to point out. First
of all, we only focused on sentiment among English-speaking Twitter users. Depending on the
language and the social media platform, there is the possibility that our findings could differ by
seeing more intense or reduced toxicity. Also, in categorizing the strength of an artist’s parasocial
relationship, the thresholds we chose for our metrics were dependent on the data we collected as
well as our domain knowledge. This would mean that using our thresholds to categorize other
artists might not accurately represent the true strength of their parasocial relationship with their
fans. Therefore, for future research, we would advise conducting network analysis on a canceled
artist’s Twitter followers to quantify the strength of their parasocial relationship with their fans.
In addition, since we only conducted case studies on six canceled individuals of varying follower
counts, it is possible that our findings may differ if we have chosen different artists or included
more canceled artists. Despite this, all of our canceled artists saw some sort of increase in toxicity
post cancellation, suggesting that cancel culture may lead to an overall rise in negative sentiment
over time. For future research, we would advise seeing if overall sentiment towards a canceled artist
is affected by whether they publicly apologized or not. We suspect that if an artist had publicly
apologized, they may show reduced toxicity and negative sentiment after cancellation compared to
artists who have not publicly apologized.
To summarize, it appears that there is a rise in toxicity towards canceled individuals over time.
However, there are various factors that seem to contribute to the variation in negative sentiment
after cancellation. Cancel culture on Twitter is still an evolving phenomenon that has only begun
to be recognized in recent years. Because of this and the many factors that can affect the amount of
toxicity directed towards canceled individuals, it is difficult to determine whether cancel culture is
effective in ostracizing them from society or to what extent would it affect their lives and reputations.
Regardless, the intense backlash they face in the short term demonstrates that Twitter users can
hold canceled individuals accountable for their actions to some extent. This could put pressure on
canceled individuals to publicly apologize and acknowledge their actions, which is already evident
with some of our case studies such as Aespa’s Giselle (Kim). Cancel culture can emphasize that
certain behavior is not acceptable in today’s socio-political climate by holding accountable canceled
individuals on a public stage. However, future research is needed to assess its effect on canceled
16individuals’ reputations in the long-term and the extent to which cancel culture can go.
9 Conclusion
Our initial hypothesis was that online communities, specifically on the social media platform Twit-
ter, respond to an artist’s controversy by effectively “canceling” them. We defined “canceling”
as a rise in negative sentiment and toxicity towards an individual. From our research into cancel
culture, we determined that cancel culture does negatively impact sentiment towards music artists’
on Twitter. Through our analysis, we found different factors and aspects of artists can have an
effect on the severity and duration of toxicity received after cancellation. We identified these areas
of interest as the type of issue they were canceled for, the background of the artist, and the strength
of their parasocial relationships. To conclude, our investigation through our three sub-questions
shows that cancel culture overall can impact public opinion and sentiment towards controversial
artists on Twitter. We captured the effect of cancel culture before and after artists’ controversies,
but long term effects like complete ostracization from mainstream popular culture or continued
toxicity did not seem to be evident as sentiment eventually returned to normal within the time
frame we looked at. Cancel culture is a topic that is heavily debated, but we believe that our
analysis has provided some context to understand and quantify cancel culture as a whole.

19","Cancel culture on Twitter has a negative impact on the music industry. Musicians who are ""canceled"" for offensive or socially unacceptable behavior face increased toxicity and negativity on the platform. The type of issue an artist is canceled for, their background, and the strength of their parasocial relationship with fans all affect public sentiment. Discrimination against marginalized groups tends to generate more negative sentiment than abuse allegations or misinformation. Hip-hop artists experience longer and more severe negative sentiment compared to K-pop and pop artists.

Abstract
Historically , analysis on single-cell data has been dif ficult to perform, due to data
collection methods often resulting in the destruction of the cell in the process of collecting
information. However , an ongoing endeavor of biological data science has recently been to
analyze dif ferent modalities, or forms, of the genetic information within a cell. The information
collected on the three modalities of DNA, RNA, and protein can be done safely and because it is
known that they are the same information in dif ferent forms, analysis done on them can be
extrapolated to understand the cell as a whole. Previous research has been conducted by Gala, R.,
Budzillo, A., Baftizadeh, F . et al. to capture gene expression in neuron cells with a neural
network called a coupled autoencoder . This autoencoder framework is able to reconstruct the
inputs, allowing the prediction of one input to another , as well as align the multiple inputs in the
same low dimensional representation. In our paper , we build upon this coupled autoencoder on a
data set of cells taken from several sites of the human body , predicting from RNA  information to
protein. We find that the autoencoder is able to adequately cluster the cell types in its lower
dimensional representation, as well as perform decently at the prediction task.
Introduction
Cells are the basic building blocks of life, thus
they are important to how our bodies
function. Inside all of our cells are three dif ferent forms, or modalities, of genetic information:
DNA, mRNA, and proteins. Genes are made up of DNA  and every single cell in the human body
possesses the same genes. Cells can activate certain parts of the gene to produce specific
proteins, allowing the cells in the body to specialize despite drawing from the same set of
instructions. These proteins then go on to perform important biological tasks for each cell,
allowing living or ganisms to function. For example, some proteins, called ribosomes, translate
mRNA  into producing other proteins including itself, ef fectively regulating the process of
something that created it. This cyclic nature demonstrates the interconnectedness of genetic
information flow within all human cells.
An ongoing mission of scientists in the field of biological data science is to predict this
flow of genetic information from one modality to another . While researchers have been
interested in analyzing single-cell data in the past, modern science lacked methods to accurately
measure data pertaining to a cell as a whole without destroying it in the process. This made
analysis dif ficult to perform, they would be left without the ground truth to compare their results
to
1
. However , this issue can be circumvented due to
the fact that we know that protein comesfrom RNA, and so on. This allows us to perform analysis on specific modalities, which can
provide us insights that we can extrapolate to cells as a whole.
To further our understanding of how genetic information can transition between
modalities will aid modern medicine in regards to what goes wrong in a human body in the
context of illness

Our Contribution
There have been previous approaches of applying autoencoders
to handle cross-modal
biology problems in data science. In 2021,
Gala, R.,
Budzillo, A., Baftizadeh, F . et al. published
a scientific article on the application of coupled autoencoders to capture gene expression in
neurons. They emphasize the power of a linked network of autoencoders (which they dub as a
coupled autoencoder) to simultaneously optimize accurate reconstructions of input data while
also ensuring that the representation between dif ferent input data is as similar as possible.
In this paper , we propose to utilize the same coupled
autoencoder concept that they
outlined to handle our cross-modality prediction problem. The coupled autoencoder builds upon
the functionality of a single autoencoder , enabling both the reconstruction between and within
modalities. A byproduct of this framework is that there is a common embedding, shared by both
inputs, which allows us to align both modalities to the same space after encoding. Our goal is to
predict one modality from another , from RNA  data to protein and from protein to RNA. We
implement this autoencoder in our project and find that it is able to perform decently at both
clustering the cell types in the latent space, as well as cross-modal prediction. We try to improve
this model with further supervision by adding additional loss functions for training and adding a
scale factor for the model to learn to reconstruct the data, as we transformed one modality
specifically before inputting it into the model. We find that the autoencoder performs quite
adequately for RNA  to ADT  prediction, although further improvements could be made.
Methods
2.1
: Problem set up
As previously mentioned, the objective of our analysis is to perform cross-modal
prediction between the two modalities of genetic information. Although the autoencoder
framework allows bidirectional prediction, our focus will lie primarily on RNA  to protein, as this
is the “natural” direction of information flow in cells. The alignment of the latent space for our
autoencoder will be judged by visual means, while the reconstruction accuracy will be judged by
the RMSE between the reconstruction and the input of the opposite modality .2.2
: Coupled autoencoder
To accomplish our task, we will be using a coupled autoencoder model, which utilizes a
type of neural network called an autoencoder . An autoencoder consists of three, necessary layers:
the encoder layer , the code (latent space), and the decoder layers. Encoding layers are often put
between the input and the code, and decoding layers are put between the latent space and the
output layers. As the data passes between layers in the encoding portion of the autoencoder , it
under goes dimensionality reduction, which will help us denoise the data to find the components
of it that encode the most information. The decoding layers will then take the compressed
version of the data in the code and reconstruct it layer by layer as the data travels back to the
output layer .

which is two (or more) of the autoencoders
illustrated above.
Autoencoders can be connected to share the same latent space, such that they can learn to
reconstruct one set of input data from another . We can perform this linkage with our coupled
autoencoder , and we can see that both the data for GEX and ADT  are aligned. Thus a coupled
autoencoder model will be able to predict ADT  data from GEX and GEX data from ADT . In
order to improve the coupled autoencoder ’s predictions, we will need to optimize the architecture
as well as add supervision in both the latent space and the outputs.
To add supervision in the latent space, we implemented two loss functions. The first loss
function is pairwise distance loss functions. We define the pairwise loss function as:
We denote the encoder and decoder layers of the model by Ei and Ej,  Di and Dj for GEX
and ADT  respectively . In addition, we denote the original data as Xi,Xj for GEX and ADT
respectively . Z(X)  calculates the p-norm distance between each point in the data and is defined
as the following, where X is defined as the given matrix for the data. Z(X) is defined as:
While we cannot directly calculate the loss of a cell in the input space and its
representation in the embedded space, due to the dimensionality reduction aspect of the
autoencoder , we instead attempt to preserve the distance between given cells in the input space
and those corresponding cells in the latent space as a workaround. This is the goal of our
pairwise distance, where we calculate the summation of all of the dif ferences between the
pairwise distance of two given cells in the input space and in the embedding. This loss function
is then normalized by how many pairwise distance calculations were made in the summation.
The goal of our Pairwise Distance loss is to preserve the distance among the points between the
original space, and the embedding in the lower dimensions after the encoding, which would
result in the same clusters of cells inherently present in the input space to also be maintained in
the embedded space.
Our next loss inside the latent space is Alignment Loss. Since the latent space is shared
between the two modalities, we want the embeddings in the latent space to be the same in terms
of both position and general clustering patterns. Thus, this loss will be calculated as the mean
squared error between the two embeddings, i.e. the mean squared error between the embedding
of the GEX data and the ADT  data. It is defined as:
To add supervision in the model's outputs, we want to calculate the losses of the same
modality reconstruction. The loss for same modality reconstruction is defined as
We also want the model to calculate losses for cross modality prediction. This is defined as:
2.3
: Preprocessing of GEX data
The GEX data contains points where certain columns have extremely high values. In the
interest of clustering the data by their cell types, those cells can be interpreted as having much
further distances from other clusters of cells. This causes the encoder of the model to not
accurately cluster up the cell types in lower dimensions because these distant points are
dominating. An option to alleviate this issue could be to remove outliers, or to set a maximum
value for these distances, but these extreme values may be important to the identity of those
cells. Our solution is to normalize and then log transform the data. This allows the data to reduce
the lar ge distances from these far points while preserving the distribution of the points in order to
be able to cluster up the dif ferent cell types accurately in lower dimensions.
2.4
: Modifications to Coupled Autoencoder
Due to the log transform and normalization terms, we must modify the coupled
autoencoder framework in order to undo the log and normalization. To undo the log, we must
apply an inverse log function in order to bring the data back to its original form.
To undo the normalization however takes more work. Predicting the GEX from ADT
raises some challenges. To undo normalization, it requires a scale factor from the original data.
Predicting GEX from ADT  data does not give the model the scale factors it requires to undo the
normalization as it is not the original GEX data. Thus we must train the coupled autoencoder
model to learn this scale factor by adding an extra dimension to the final output of the model.
With GEX data being in R^D, the final output of the model prediction will be in R^D+1 (will fix
format on the final website). The D+1 dimension will then be extracted and multiplied to the first
D dimension in order to output the original data. Thus we allow the model to learn the scale
factor on its own to bring its predicted GEX data back to its original form.
Results
3.1
: Data and set up
The data set for the RNA  information, also called
GEX (gene expression), contains
43,967 rows and 13,593 columns. The data set for protein, called ADT , contains the same
number of rows, but 134 columns. Each row in both the GEX and ADT  data set corresponds to
the same cell, i.e. row 3 in GEX and row 3 in ADT  are information for the same cell in regards to
their respective modality . In the GEX data set, the values in each column represent a
measurement of the amount of gene expression along the RNA  strand in that cell. In the ADT
data set, the values in each column represent the amount of a particular protein found in a cell.
The single-cell modality data is taken from 4 sites in the body and is collected from 10
different donors. For our analysis, we subset the cells from Site 1 donated by Donor 2 as our
testing batch, and leave the rest for our training. This leaves the training set with 39,525 cells,
but due to computational complications, we have to further subset this down to 10,000 randomly
sampled cells. We verified that the representation both for dif ferent cell types in this smaller
subset is representative of the intended training subset.
3.2
: Coupled autoencoder results
We begin our task with our coupled autoencoder with
the dimensions of the latent space
set to 2 dimensions for the purpose of visualizing the embedded clustering of cell types. This is
also to demonstrate that the autoencoder is capable of aligning two dif ferent sets of input data
onto the same embedded spaces. Although 2 is used for this example, it is very likely that the
dimensions for the latent space of an autoencoder optimized for the prediction task may be lar ger
than 2 or 3, and will be harder to visualize. Below are various plots of the data after going
through dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA, Isomap and t-SNE, compressing the
GEX and ADT  data sets to two dimensions.a.

. The latent
space of the coupled autoencoder with ADT  data as the input.
From the three dimensionality reduction methods we first used to explore the data, we
can see some clustering of certain cell types with other types inherent in the original input space.
PCA  and Isomap, shown in Fig 2b. and 2c. for GEX and Fig 2e. and 2f. for ADT  were unable to
capture any clusters in the data for GEX, but were able to do so for ADT . It may be due to the
extremely high dimensionality of GEX that these two methods were not able to handle,
indicating that some data preprocessing might need to be performed. t-SNE, shown in Fig 2a.
and 2d. actually worked well for not only the ADT  data, but GEX, as well. While a good feat as
is, using t-SNE results in two separate, unaligned representations of both modalities in this lower
dimensionality , which ef fectively means that there is no learning “between” GEX and ADT .
In comparison, we have plotted the latent space of our coupled autoencoder for GEX in
Fig 2g. and ADT  in Fig 2h. Our autoencoder performs well in capturing the clustering of the data
like t-SNE, but is also able to correctly align the embedded spaces for both modalities. The
distribution of the points in both the GEX and ADT  modalities are well aligned, as shown by the
coordinates of the points and the scales of the axes being very similar .

predictions against varying dimensions that

task of ADT  to GEX instead.
With this in mind, we move the focus onto the predictive task, we calculate the loss of the
GEX data reconstructed from the input of ADT  data to the actual GEX data by finding the
RMSE. Before, we had brought the data down to 2 dimensions in order to visualize the cell type
clusters. But for the final model, we want the latent space to be in higher dimensions to give the
data more room to transform. After many trials we found that 10 dimensions for the latent space
provided the best results as shown below , minimizing the RMSE for both cross-modal
predictions.
We also perform some further hyperparameter tuning on both the number of epochs that
the autoencoder trains with, as well as the optimal value for the weights applied to each loss.

distances in the latent space, but it is scaled to
the same values as the ones in the original space for easier visualization.
b.
A similar heatmap,
but for the embedding of the ADT  data (actual scale is [0, 5.183]).
In the heatmaps, the warmer hues indicate a greater count of pairwise distances which fall
in that specific bin. Ideally , if the autoencoder could preserve the distances between each point
perfectly , then a linear pattern would show on the plots from the bottom left corner to the top
right. The autoencoder did decently at preserving the pairwise distances for the embedding of the
ADT  data in Fig 5b., as the pattern is more linear than the GEX data embedding. The pattern is
“narrower” and more defined, indicating that the preservation is more consistent. The embedding
of the GEX data in Fig 5a. is less linear , shallow , and less defined, instead indicating that the
autoencoder is unable to consistently preserve the pairwise distances between cells.
Fig 6 |
A table to compare the ef fects of the dimensions
of the latent space along with the choice
of preprocessing for the data. The values in the GEX to ADT  and ADT  to GEX columns are the
RMSEs for each task. “Unchanged” indicates that we input the data with its original values,
“normed” indicates that we normalized the values in every cell (row) to be of unit length, and
“logged” indicates that we perform an entrywise natural log transformation on every value of a
row. The “model” column dif ferentiates which model we used for measuring our evaluation
metric, with simple linear regression being used as the baseline and our autoencoder being used
for the rest. The addition symbol indicates that such preprocessing steps were done subsequently .
For our baseline, we used a simple linear regression model to fit the data which produced
the results shown in the first row of Fig 6. Moving onto our autoencoder , our first test had also
yet to utilize our preprocessed data and we did not optimize the hyperparameters of our model
for the prediction task. This was to compare the most basic form of our autoencoder to our
baseline. As shown above, normalizing the two data sets improves upon the baseline of 0.8775
for predicting GEX to ADT  and 405.7371 for predicting ADT  to GEX. Even more so, the
optimal number of dimensions in the latent space improves it even further , with a drastic
decrease of the RMSE from 335.2740 to 234.4840 as the dimensions are changed from 10 to 20.
Finally , we achieve our best result by normalizing the data sets and then applying a log
transformation. The dif ference between the unoptimized versus optimal number of dimensions is
again apparent, with a very slight improvement in the GEX to ADT . It is important to note that
because RNA  to protein is the natural direction of the flow of genetic information, the results of
GEX to ADT  may bear more weight than ADT  to GEX.
3.3
: Improvements and Limitations
There are some suggestions in order to improve on our model. Firstly , is the
implementation of a k-Nearest Neighbor Loss. Due to the lar ge distances of certain points from
the other points in the GEX data, a k-NN loss may assist in preserving distances between points
and its neighbors (within clusters) while ignoring distant points. However , while we have tried to
implement a k-NN approach to preserving distances, we were unable to do so in a way which the
autoencoder would be able to ef ficiently compute the nearest neighbors within each training
batch, resulting in the runtime being unfeasibly long. Even with a low number of neighbors, such
as 3 or 5, it would take a while for the autoencoder to finish training a single epoch.
We also acknowledge that the performance metrics for our autoencoder are not absolute,
as we lack the baseline performance to which we can compare the RMSEs to. We were also
unable to utilize cells of the training data due to computational costs. A person with more
domain knowledge, either in biology , data science, or both, may be able to further our findings
with improvements.
3.4
Further research
Currently we are working with cross modality between GEX or mRNA  and ADT  or
Protein data. Further research can be done on the ATAC data, or the DNA  modality . Moving
forward with this model, cross modality prediction can be performed between GEX and ATAC
data.
In addition to cross modality prediction, modality matching is another task to further this
research. The goal of modality matching is to determine the correspondence between single cell
profiles. This is dif ferent from modality prediction as the output of this task will provide the
distribution of probabilities of its predictions which will then return the sum of the weights of its
correct match.
The last task for further research is to implement joint embedding from multiple
modalities. This task will focus on learning the embedded space between multiple modalities,
similar to the cell clusters in the latent space but in higher dimensions. The metrics will focus on
alignment, cell cycle preservation and label conservation.
4.
Conclusion
As a result, a coupled autoencoder framework to perform cross modality prediction in
single cells will provide great benefits for future study . Our results visualize a common space
where two modalities are able to share. Though there are other dimension reduction techniques
similar to the encoder layer of our model such as TSNE, PCA, and ISOMAPS, the space
between the two modalities are not shared or do not cluster well. The coupled autoencoder
framework is able to utilize this shared space between the two modalities in order to predict
across modalities. Moving forward, further research will improve on this model. Dif ferent LossFunctions such as a K nearest neighbor loss can be added in order to preserve distances more
precisely . In addition, dif ferent preprocessing techniques may prove to assist in improving the
model due to the high dimensions of GEX data.  Analysis on single cell data has been dif ficult in
the past to perform, thus accurate predictions will provide great insight on the flow of
information inside our cells. This will benefit modern science as it gives insights on how
illnesses occur and the intricacies of the human body .

Abstract
Prompt tuning and prefix tuning are two effec-
tive mechanisms to leverage frozen language
models to perform downstream tasks. Robust-
ness reflects models’ resilience of output under
a change or noise in the input. In this paper,
we analyze the robustness of natural language
models using various tuning methods with re-
spect to a domain shift (i.e. training on a do-
main but evaluating on out-of-domain data).
We apply both prompt tuning and prefix tun-
ing on T5 models for reading comprehension
(i.e. question-answering) and GPT-2 models
for table-to-text generation.
1 Introduction
NLP models have recently achieved outstanding
performances and are thus gained prevalent appli-
cations in real world. With this popularity, it is
important to make sure these models could adapt
well in the dynamic circumstances. More specif-
ically, robustness with respect to domain shifts is
supposed to be considered when developing mod-
els. Because the same large pretrained language
models are often applied to different tasks or fields.
It would be inefficient and impractical if we train
the model with corresponding inputs every time
we apply them to a different domain. We want
large models can be easily reused. Improvement
on models to ensure they are robust against change
of inputs has been a hot topic for study.
With the advance of NLP, a wide range of mech-
anisms have been developed to adjust large pre-
trained language models to downstream tasks. To
avoid the update and storage of language model
parameters, Li and Liang (2021) developed prefix
tuning, which freezes the parameters of language
model, and only optimizes the small continuous
task-specific vector (i.e. the prefix). They ap-
ply prefix tuning on GPT-2 models, and find great
model performances under different data settings.Prompt tuning (Lester et al., 2021) is proposed
as a further simplification of prefix tuning. Similar
to prefix tuning, the pretrained language model is
frozon, but prompt tuning only allows the pre −1
of k soft prompt to the input data. With the end-to-
end employment of prompt tokens, prompt tuning
achieves outperforming results and efficient model
reuse.
2 Experimental Setup
2.1 Datasets and Metrics
For GPT-2 model, we investigate the robustness re-
spect to domain shift on Table-to-Text generations.
We train the model on WebNLG (Colin et al., 2016),
and test on DART (Radev et al., 2020). DART is
more complex and has larger size than WebNLG.
DART is open-domain while WebNLG has only
14 domains. We evaluate the performance using
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) score, which is re-
ported by the official evaluation script for WebNLG
and DART. We will also include METEOR (Satan-
jeev and Lavie, 2005) and TER (Snover and Dorr,
2006) score, which measures the translation accu-
racy.
The WebNLG (Colin et al., 2016) corpus com-
prises of 25,298 (data, text) pairs and 9,674 sets of
triplets(subject, property, object) describing facts
(entities and relations between them) and the cor-
responding facts in form of natural language texts.
The test set is split into two parts: on one hand, it
contains DBpedia categories that were seen in the
training data; and on the other hand, it consists of
inputs from 5 unseen categories.
DART (Radev et al., 2020) is a large dataset for
open-domain structured data record to text genera-
tion. It has a similar input format to WebNLG but
richer and more diverse predicates than WebNLG.
DART consists of 82,191 examples across differ-
ent domains with hierarchical inputs based on a
tree ontology that transforms a flat table into a treestructure.
For T5 models, we investigate the robustness
using question answering(QA) tasks. In our exper-
iments, We train on the SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al.,
2016) dataset, and test on the DuoRC (Saha et al.,
2018) dataset. The evaluation metric for T5 is
EM/F1 score, derived from the script provided by
the MRQA challenge by Fisch et al. (2019). Later
in this project, we may test the same model on
more reading comprehension related datasets and
report their evaluation metrics, as they are available
from the MRQA challenge. We may also propose
novel evaluation metrics that better demonstrate
how a model has leaned toward an out-of-domain
distribution.
SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) is a reading com-
prehension dataset, containing 107,785 question-
answer pairs. Questions in this dataset are posed
by crowdworkers from Wikipedia articles, and the
answer to every question is a segment of text from
the corresponding reading passage, meaning the
system will select the answer from all possible
spans. Even though span-based answers are more
constrained, SQuAD dataset still provides us with
diverse questions and answer types.
DuoRC (Saha et al., 2018) is another dataset for
reading comprehension dataset. DuoRC contains
186,089 (question,answer) pairs generated from
a collection of 7680 pairs of movie plots. Every
pair in the collection reflects two versions of the
same movie since they are written by two different
groups of crowdworkers. This makes the answers
less overlapping, different in levels of plot details
and higher requirements for reasoning process.
2.2 Methods & Hyperparameters
In our work, we will apply both prompt and prefix
tuning on T5 and GPT-2 models. Our experimen-
tal design spans two dimensions for each model
and tuning method. First, we measure the robust-
ness of tuning with respect to different model sizes,
given the same prompt length. Second, we measure
the robustness of tuning with respect to different
prompt lengths, given the same model size. We
train both T5 and GPT-2 models with sizes range
from small, base and large, and with prompt lengths
from 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50. The prompts and prefixes
are initialized from vocabulary.
For the T5 model, we followed one of the current
de-facto ways of training the model. In particular,
we trained it with AdaFactor with a learning rate ofConfiguration In-Domain Out-of-Domain

0.001 and no scheduler. In terms of the optimizer,
we disabled scaling the parameter and the relative
step. We used a clip threshold of 1.0, and we did
not have any warm up steps during training. We
run 4 epochs through all the training data in our
experiments. This applies to both prompt tuning
and prefix tuning. We don’t want to spend much
time playing with the hyperparameters (since it’s
not for publication), and we hope that our setting
will give a more realistic performance of the model.
For the GPT-2 model, we followed the opti-
mized parameters provided by Prefix-tuning (Li
and Liang, 2021). In particular, we trained it with
AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019)
and a linear learning rate scheduler according to
the HuggingFace default setup. The learning rate
is5·10−5. At decoding time, we use beam search
with a beam size of 5 for the DART dataset.
3 Results
Although we largely haven’t run through the exper-
iments, we are getting some preliminary results onprompt tuning with T5 models. Figure 1 reports
the evaluation metrics of some T5 models trained
on SQuAD dataset and evaluated on the DuoRC
dataset. In the near future, we are expecting to
release more results on 1. evaluation metrics of
T5 models with different configurations tested on
other out-of-domain datasets with prompt tuning
in question-answering; 2. evaluation metrics of
GPT2 models with different configurations tested
on other out-of-domain datasets with prompt tuning
in table-to-text generation.
4 Discussion
In this section, we will discuss the advantage of
prefix/prompt tuning. We also want to address
some limitations in this study.
4.1 Advantages
Prefix/prompt tuning will only train on a small
subset of parameters and freeze other parameters,
which significantly reduces training costs. Suppose
we have many individual tasks but share the same
model structure. In that case, prefix/prompt tuning
could maintain modularity and save time/space by
only adding and deleting prefix/prompt for each
task. Beyond that, the inference is more efficient
with prefix/prompt settings. Instead of having dif-
ferent models and calling forward multiple times,
we can do a single forward pass with batches.
4.2 Limitations
Because of time limitations, we do not perform
ablation tests to examine the internal representation
of prefix/prompt tokens. However, this is another
exciting topic we want to explore in the future.
For example, if we could find some patterns in the
space of prefix/prompt tokens, we could directly
add a prefix/prompt to a pretrained model when a
new task comes. This would allow us to obtain a
model which has comparable performance to fine-
tuned models, but with no extra costs.
5 Conclusion
We will make a conclusion once we get more ex-
perimental results.

Introduction
In a previous study , Deloitte Consulting LLP  developed a method of creating city
simulations through cellular location and geospatial data. Using these simulations of human
activity and traf fic patterns, better decisions can be made regarding modes of transportation or
road construction. However , the current commonly used method of estimating transportation
mode choice is a utility model that involves many features and coef ficients that may not
necessarily be important but still make the model more complex. Our goal is to use a tree-based
approach - in particular , XGBoost - to identify just the features that are important for
determining mode choice so that we can create a model that is simpler , robust, and easily
deployable. By the end of the quarter , we plan to have a working model to predict mode choice
and a written paper to report our results and analyses.
2.
Hypothesis
The primary reason for choosing a tree-based model is due to its built-in hyperparameters
for handling overfitting. These hyperparameters will be important in ensuring that our model is
general enough to be applied to dif ferent scenarios while maintaining its accuracy . Therefore we
need a good technique to choose the best values for our hyperparameters.
Currently , most models use grid search or random search to pick hyperparameter values;
however , these methods are exhaustive and inef ficient. Our proposal is to use Bayesian
optimization, a method that involves choosing a value from a distribution based on its pastevaluations. Since Bayesian optimization learns from its past iterations, it is able to find the
optimal hyperparameter values faster than grid or random search.
Our hypothesis is that our XGBoost classifier for travel mode choice, tuned with
Bayesian optimization, will be able to achieve the same or higher accuracy than existing utility
models on the same Chicago dataset and maintain a similar performance on other datasets,
including imbalanced datasets and specific subpopulations.
3.
Datasets
The datasets we use consists of two dataframes: trips and utilityvars. The first dataframe,
trips comes from a csv that previously predicted the travel mode choice each activity took, linked
to activity and person IDs.
The utilityvars data provides us information about each unique trip, which includes
activityid, age, gender , autosuf, numhouseholdpersons, income, oduden, oempden, ototint,
dempden, sovdrivetime, hovdrivetime, tolldrivetime, tollcostsov , tollcosthov2, tollcosthov3,
walkttime, walktotransitutility , drivetotransitutility , parkingcost, parkingwalktime, sovcost,
hovcost, tollcost, tourpurpose, firststop, laststop, zerototalstops, and the variable we are
predicting, tar gettripmode.  Tourmode was removed from our dataset because it provides the
same information as our tar gettripmode. We plotted some of the variables to get insight into the
distributions of our data and the activities we have.
The tar gettripmode has 12 dif ferent trip modes, and its distribution is shown in the figure
below . The modes range from 1 to 12, and the most common trip modes are 1, 3, and 5, which
are Drive Alone Free, HOV2 Free, HOV3 Free. The least common trip modes are 6, 10, 4:HOV3 Pay , Park and Ride, HOV2 Pay . This shows that most travelling is done through driving
and without paying. In most cases, it is rare that people pay when driving.
Another variable we plotted a histogram of is age. Most activities consist of people of age
groups categorized as 4, 6, 7, which are people of ages 25 and above, with more of the older age
range. The gap we see between 5 to 6 is because our data on age does not have the category of 5.
Another descriptive variable we have is of income. The income group 3 is the highest,
which has the average income of $60k to $100k. The lowest group for income is group 4, which
is the average income of $100k to $150k. Most households in our dataset have an income that is
around average, and in general, of lower income groups. Income subpopulations can be
interpreted in our model because this can af fect travel modes.

Techniques
4.1 XGBoost
XGBoost, abbreviated from Extreme Gradient Boosting, is an ensemble tree method that
builds upon the results from simple decision trees, using gradient descent to boost the weak
learners, to make better decisions as it increases in depth. The objective function is defined as
follows:
𝑂𝑏𝑗=𝑖=1𝑛∑𝐿(𝑦𝑖,𝑦𝑖)+𝑖=1𝑘∑𝑅(𝑓𝑖)
where L  is the loss function,  is the predicted label and  is the actual label, and R(f) is the penalty
function for complexity .

4.2 Bayesian optimizer
Since there are so many hyperparameters in the XGBoost classifier , using grid search for
tuning would take a long time and would limit us to a set number of values to test. Instead, we
will use a Bayesian optimizer with mean AUC score as the evaluation indicator , similarly to the
one used in the heart disease article, to find the value for each hyperparameter that will yield the
highest accuracy on the validation set.Bayesian Optimization is capable of ef fectively optimizing object functions which are
costly to evaluate. It takes into account past evaluations when selecting the next hyper -parameter
to set. It selects hyper -parameter combinations in an informed way , concentrating on the most
promising areas of search space, so it generally needs less iteration to get the best
hyper -parameter combination.
The generic Bayesian optimization algorithm (acquisition function: EI) below:
For t = 1,2,3… repeat:
●
By optimizing the acquisition function over the Gaussian process, find the next
sampling point:𝑋𝑡=𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑥𝑢(𝑥|Ɗ1:𝑡−1)
●
By evaluating the objective function

𝑦𝑡=𝑓(𝑋𝑡)+ϵ𝑡
●
Add new sample
to the previous samples
and(𝑋𝑡 , 𝑦𝑡)Ɗ1:𝑡={Ɗ1:𝑡−1 , (𝑋𝑡 , 𝑦𝑡)}
update the Gaussian process
5.
XGBoost Model Implementation
We split the data 80/20 into train and test sets, resulting in a train set of 9600 trips and a
test set of 2400 trips for our uniform subsample. Since our data is a multiclass problem, we used
the multi softprob function as our objective function and AUC as our evaluation metric.
6.
Results
7.1.1 Evaluation (curves, confusion matrix, metrics)After we finished the model, we created a validation pipeline to estimate the performance
of our model and sought the potential problems in our model, like overfitting or imbalanced
sample.
For measurement of correctness, we referred to evaluation metrics such as accuracy ,
sensitivity , F1-score. The feedback indicates that our model did a great job on the sample data,
but also causes a great deal of concern. In the next weeks, we would diagnose the problem and
adjust our model accordingly .
Current metrics:

Sensitivity

We also created the AUC curve for our model performance in the train/test dataset.
To check whether our model performed badly on specific labels, we output the confusion
matrix and normalized it.

7.1.2 Evaluation on Income Groups
7.2 Feature Fine-tuning
We retrieved the importance scores for all our features in order to create a new model
using only the important features. Based on the graph below , we observed that employment
density at the origin and destination regions (dempden, oempden) were the two most important
features in determining trip mode, followed by dwelling unit density at the origin region
(oduden). This may be due to the fact that areas with a higher employment or residential density
are likely more urbanized and have more public transportation options available, such as trains,
subways, and buses. We intend to use all the features as or more important than the singleoccupancy vehicle cost (sovcost) in our optimized model and observe how well it predicts trip
mode in comparison to the model trained on all the features.

Datasets
The data we use in the next quarter consists of three dataframes: household_data, person_data, and
mode_choice_variables, which cover the details and background of a potential trip.
The household data give us information about its location, income level, and building/unit type.The person data tell us about the basic background of individuals in each household, including age, sex,
race, educational attainment, and employment status.
The mode choice data focus on the information about traveling. It contains key points, such as the purpose
of the tour, the standard of living in the origin area, and the time and money spent on the trip in different choices
(different combinations of vehicle types and road types). The methods of transportation include single occupancy
vehicle, multiple occupancy vehicle, and walk while the road types include open road and toll road. It can help us to
confirm the actual travel mode that a specific individual would like to choose.

Quarter 1 Project: Heart Disease Dataset
To familiarize ourselves with the algorithm that we will use in the next quarter capstone project, we
replicated a paper
An optimized XGBoost based diagnostic
system for effective prediction of heart disease
.
The
analysis is carried out on Cleveland heart disease dataset taken from UCI online machine learning and data mining
repository. The dataset contains 303 patients who potentially had heart disease in distinct levels and their living
features like age, sex, and etc. The goal of the authors is to correctly predict whether a patient has heart disease,
regardless of whether the symptoms are severe or not. The proposed XGBoost model in the paper has a high
accuracy of 91.8% and performed better than other tree models. We noticed, however, that the 13 features the
authors used were based on other studies rather than their own results, so we chose to keep all the features,
excluding ones that did not provide useful values (e.g. “id”, features with only one value), in our replication model
to find important features manually.
Although the background of the replication task is different from that of our project in the next quarter, it
provides us with a robust XGBoost tree as our classification model. Many techniques that we have been taught in
the replication task could be applied to the travel model: One-hot encoding, hyper-parameter tuning by Bayesian
Optimization, feature selection, and etc. We get to know about different evaluation metrics to evaluate the tree
model, and the standard is also suitable for our future classifier.","The authors propose using a tree-based approach, specifically XGBoost, to create a simpler and more robust model for determining transportation mode choice. They plan to use Bayesian optimization to tune the hyperparameters of the XGBoost classifier. The datasets used include information about trips, activities, and individuals. The XGBoost model is implemented and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and F1-score. The importance of different features in determining trip mode is analyzed. The authors also mention their previous project on heart disease prediction using XGBoost as a reference for their future work."

1. Introduction
Nowadays, the algorithmic decision-making system has been very common in people’s daily lives.
Gradually, some algorithms become too complex for humans to interpret, such as some black-box
machine learning models and deep neural networks. In order to assess the fairness of the models and
make them better tools for different parties, we need explainable AI (XAI) to uncover the reasoning
behind the predictions made by those black-box models. In our project, we will be focusing on using
different techniques from causal inferences and explainable AI to interpret various classification models
across various domains. In particular, we are interested in three domains - healthcare, finance, and the
housing market. Within each domain, we are going to train four binary classification models first, and we
have four goals in general: 1) Explaining black-box models both globally and locally with various XAI
methods. 2) Assessing the fairness of each learning algorithm with regard to different sensitive attributes;
3) Generating recourse for individuals - a set of minimal actions to change the prediction of those
black-box models. 4) Explaining False Negative and False Positive predictions using Causal Inference.2. Datasets
2.1 Description of Datasets
In our project, we will use datasets from three domains:
finance
, the
housing market
, and
healthcare
.
For the
finance
domain, we will use the loan defaulter
dataset obtained from Kaggle. The loan defaulter
dataset consists of information such as gender and income of 307,511 applicants. For this dataset, we will
predict whether an applicant will be a defaulter.
For the
housing market
domain, we will use the Airbnb
dataset obtained from Kaggle. The Airbnb
dataset consists of basic information such as name and location for 3,818 Airbnb properties. For this
dataset, we will predict the class that the price of an Airbnb property falls into.
For the
healthcare
domain, we will use the data on
hospital readmission for diabetes patients obtained
from Kaggle. The data was collected for the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program operated by
Medicare & Medicaid Services and indicates whether diabetic patients were readmitted to the hospital and
whether it was within 30 days or after beyond 30 days. This dataset contains records for 101,766 patients
and includes attributes for each patient such as race, age, gender, insulin levels, type of admission, and
other specific information about medical history. For this dataset, we will predict whether the patient will
be readmitted.
2.2 Datasets Preprocessing
2.2.1 Loan Dataset
The original loan dataset has 307,511 rows and 122 columns. We first dropped the 49 columns that have
more than 35% of missing values and are not relevant to the classification task. Then we did missingvalue imputation for categorical features using the mode and for numerical features using the mean value.
Then we one-hot encoded 12 categorical features and created column names for the one-hot encoding
results by combining the feature name and category it falls into. For example, for the
'
CODE_GENDER
'
feature, the one-hot encoded columns are
'CODE_GENDER:
F' (representing female) and
'CODE_GENDER: M' (representing male).
Since the Target
column is highly imbalanced, we sampled the
dataset to make it balanced. The resulting dataset has 49,650 rows and 187 columns,
where 186 columns
are features, and 1 column is the label column.
2.2.2 Airbnb Dataset
For the Airbnb dataset, we only kept 35 columns that are relevant for predicting the listing price,
including the number of bedrooms, amenities, locations, availability, etc. Then, we did some data
cleaning, including striping string characters in numerical features, filling some null values with mean,
mode, and string “None” accordingly, and dropping null values that are meaningless. The original dataset
has 3818 records, and there were 2844 records left after the data cleaning. We further engineered the
categorical features using one-hot encoding, and we binarized our label “Price” with the threshold of
average price among all listings. Finally, the feature dataset is in the shape of 2844
263, and the
label×
dataset is in the shape of 2844
1.×
2.2.3 Healthcare Dataset
The healthcare dataset was filtered down to 10 relevant columns: race, gender, age, admission type, time
in hospital, insulin level, diabetes, whether the patient takes a diabetic medication, and whether the patient
was readmitted or not (the target variable). For race and gender, each category within the column was
transformed into a new feature. For each category of race (white, black, Hispanic, Asian, Other) and each
gender (Male and Female), a new binary feature was created to indicate whether the patient identified
with that category. The age column had an age for each patient, so the column was binarized (1 or 0) toindicate whether the patient was older than 50. The column indicating insulin level contained four
categories (No, Up, Steady, Down) and was transformed into 4 different binary features. Lastly, the target
variable column for readmission was transformed into a binary column which included a 1 if the patient
was readmitted before or after 30 days, and a 0 if the patient was never readmitted.
3. Description of Methods
3.1 Machine Learning Models
We trained four black-box classification models:
XGBoost
,
which implements machine learning
algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework;
LightGBM
, which is a fast and high-performance
gradient boosting framework based on decision tree algorithms;
TabNet
, which is a Deep Neural Network
for tabular data;
SVM
, which does classification by
constructing a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in a
high-dimensional space. All four models are capable of doing binary classification tasks and their
parameters don’t have any physical significance in terms of equivalence to process parameters such as
heat or mass transfer coefficients.
3.2 Model Explanations
We used both global model-agnostic and local model-agnostic methods to generate explanations for the
four binary classification models.
3.2.1 Partial Dependence Plot (PDP)
The Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) is a global model-agnostic method that works by marginalizing the
machine learning model output over the distribution of the features in set C so that the function shows the
relationship between the features in set S we are interested in and the predicted outcome. In the case thatfeatures are uncorrelated, a PDP shows how the average prediction in the dataset changes when a feature
changes.
3.2.2 Permutation Feature Importance
The Permutation Feature Importance is a global model-agnostic method that calculates the feature
importance by permuting the feature in the datase
t.
A feature is important if the error of a model increases
significantly after permuting the feature. A feature is not important if the error of a model does not change
after shuffling the feature values. The Permutation Feature Importance method takes into account all
interactions with other features by destroying the interaction effects with other features when permuting
the feature.
3.2.3 Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME)
As a local model-agnostic method, LIME
tests what
happens to the model output when we give variations
of the model input data. LIME trains an interpretable model such as a decision tree on the perturbed data,
which is a good approximation of the black box model predictions locally. Since LIME has the advantage
of generating local explanations for different black-box models, we can use it as a good model
explanation method to generate explanations for single instances.
3.2.4 Shapley Values
By calculating a feature’s Shapley value, which is its average marginal contribution across all possible
coalitions, we can generate local explanations for instance in interest. The sum of Shapley values for all
features yields the difference between the actual prediction of a single instance and the average prediction.
In other words, if we estimate Shapley values for all features, we will get a complete distribution of actual
prediction minus the average prediction among the feature values.3.3 Fairness Evaluations
In this section we conduct some common fairness tests on the models trained on the loan dataset and the
healthcare dataset. We pick out sensitive attributes that should be independent of the target variable base
on human knowledge. For each sensitive attribute, we run multiple fairness evaluation methods based on
the models’ accuracy, predictivity, and causal reasoning.
3.3.1 Sensitive Attributes
There were various sensitive attributes in both the loan dataset and healthcare dataset that had the
potential to disrupt the fairness and accuracy of the models built. In the loan dataset, gender is the most
sensitive attribute. In the healthcare dataset, race, gender, and age are the most sensitive attributes most
susceptible to cause biased model predictions. In the loan dataset, gender should be independent of the
target variable because the model may associate a specific gender with a greater likelihood of loan
defaults simply due to the trends it learns in the sample of data used for training. For example, the model
may predict female individuals as more likely to default on loans if they have lower incomes or no credit;
this may only be the case because women may not be breadwinners if they are married and thus may have
no credit. However, the model would indicate a high probability of default if an individual is female when
in fact the two variables are not directly correlated and gender itself is not a predictor. The same
phenomenon applies to race, gender, and age in the healthcare dataset. A sensitive attribute like race
should be independent of the target variable representing hospital readmission because the model may
associate a particular race as being more likely to be readmitted to a hospital. Other hidden factors such as
insulin level, occupation, and level of physical activity may make it appear that a particular race has a
higher risk of readmission when in fact race by itself is not a predictor of readmission.
3.3.2 Fairness Evaluate Methods
In this section, we use the following definitions:X: All features given to the model
T: True value of the target variable (binary variable)
Y: Model prediction (binary variable)
p: Model predicted probability (continuous variable in [0~1])
S: Sensitive attribute
The following method are the methods we use to evaluate fairness:
1)
Group fairness:
A fair model’s prediction should be independent of the sensitive attribute. Therefore, it should
have the same probability of giving a positive prediction for individuals of different protected
classes. In this test we check if  P(Y = 1|S = s
i
)
= P(Y = 1|S = s
j
). Notice that this test does not
require the actual value of the target variable. In other words, the test is independent of whether
the model makes the correct predictions.
2)
Predictive parity:
This test measures the model’s predictive power on different groups of the protected class. The
probability of the model making the correct prediction should be the same across different groups.
In this test, we check if the true positive rates are the same among groups: P(T = 1|Y = 1, S= s
i
) =
P(T = 1|Y = 1, S = s
j
). The method can be also be
applied with different prediction evaluation
metrics.
3)
Matching conditional frequencies:
This test is similar to the predictive parity test, except we consider the distribution of predicted
probabilities rather than the binarized prediction. We binned the predicted probabilities and
compare the frequencies of each bin across different groups. For each bin, We check if P(T = 1|Y
∈
  bin
k
, S= s
i
) = P(T = 1|Y  
∈
 bin
k
, S = s
j
)4)
Causal discrimination
The model is counterfactually fair if its prediction is independent of the change of sensitive
variable. We conduct the test by flipping or randomly shuffling the sensitive attribute of the test
set and checking if the prediction remains the same.
3.4 Explaining False Positive (FP) and False Negative (FN) Predictions
In this section, we are interested in explaining both false positive and false negative predictions made by
different black-box models. In other words, we would like to explore reasons why a particular model
predicts positive outcomes whereas the true label is negative and why a model predicts negative outcomes
whereas the true label is positive. To analyze FP and FN predictions, we will be using causal inferences in
general, and the details of each step are described below.
3.4.1 Changing Labels
To begin with, we are going to change the label of a dataset to denote whether a prediction is FP or FN.
For example, in the original Airbnb dataset, the label encodes whether a price of a listing is above or
below average with values 0 and 1. In the case of FP analysis, we will be changing the label to 0 and 1,
where value 1 denotes that a prediction of the model is FP and value 0 denotes that a prediction of the
model is not FP.
3.4.2 Modeling
To do causal inference, we first need to model the assumptions and create causal graphs that explain the
causal relationships between variables, including the treatment and outcome that we are interested in.3.4.3 Identification
After reasoning about the problem with causal graphs, we need to identify an estimable quantity that
represents
generated by the intervention graph. Also, the desired quantity should be𝑃(𝑌|𝑑𝑜(𝑇))
calculated using statistical observations alone. We call it an identification step.
3.4.4 Estimation
After identifying the estimable quantity, we use the observed data to compute the target probability
expression. For binary treatments, the causal effect is
. The ultimate
goal of estimation is to estimate𝐸[𝑌|𝑇 = 1, 𝑊 = 𝑤] − 𝐸[𝑌|𝑇 = 0, 𝑊 = 𝑤]
when all confounders W are kept constant.𝑝(𝑌|𝑇=𝑡)
3.4.5 Robustness Check
After conducting estimation, we need to test the robustness of the estimate to the violation of
assumptions. One example is using a Placebo Treatment Refuter by replacing the treatment variable with
a randomly-generated variable and seeing if the estimate is zero to check if the treatment really causes the
outcome. To check the sensitivity of an estimate to a new confounder, we can use an Unobserved
Confounder Refuter by simulating a confounder based on a given correlation with both treatment and
outcome and rerun the analysis to see if the direction of the estimate flips.
3.5 Counterfactual Recourse
For the counterfactual recourse, we plan to use the LEWIS algorithm that is developed by Sainyam
Galhotra, Romila Pradhan, and Babak Salimi. For an individual who got an undesired outcome from the
model, LEWIS can provide minimal interventions on a set of actionable variables that have a high
sufficiency score for the individual to get a different outcome (Galhotra, Pradhan, Salimi, 7).4. Results
4.1 Model Explanations
4.1.1 Global Explanations
In this section, we will present several interesting examples of PDP and Permutation Feature Importance.
Example from loan dataset
Below is the PDPs of ‘FLAG_OWN_CAR: N’, ‘NAME_INCOME_TYPE: Unemployed’,
‘NAME_HOUSING_TYPE: Rented apartment’, ‘NAME_EDUCATION_TYPE: Higher Education’ from
the
loan
dataset that uses the XGBoost model.
Based on the partial dependence plots, we can tell that when the value of ‘FLAG_OWN_CAR: N’,
‘NAME_INCOME_TYPE: Unemployed’, and ‘NAME_HOUSING_TYPE: Rented apartment’ changes
from 0 to 1, the average prediction in the dataset increases. And when the value of
‘NAME_EDUCATION_TYPE: Higher Education’ changes from 0 to 1, the average prediction decreases.
Combining the domain knowledge, we can tell that the four plots show an accurate relationship: in reality,
a person is more likely to be a defaulter if the person doesn’t have a car, doesn’t have a job, or is renting
apartments. And a person with higher education is more likely to get a loan.
The graph below shows the ten most important features generated by permutation feature importance on
the test set of loan data that uses the XGBoost Model.
According to the permutation importance graph, we can see that except for the features that are
determined by an external source (‘EXT_SOURCE_3’ and ‘EXT_SOURCE_2’),
‘AMT_GOODS_PRICE’ and ‘AMT_CREDIT’ are the two most important features. So we can see that
the price of the goods for which the loan is given and the credit amount of the loan are very important in a
loan application. ‘DAYS_BIRTH’, which represents the applicant’s age in days at the time of application
is also important. To evaluate the feature importances using domain knowledge, we can tell that the
ranking of features based on their importance is quite accurate as attributes like the amount of money a
person is applying for, the age of the applicant, and the applicant's days of employment are definitely
heavily considered during the loan application process.
Example from Airbnb dataset
Below are the PDPs of ‘accommodates’, ‘bathrooms’, ‘bedrooms’, and ‘cleaning_fee’ in the
Airbnb
dataset that uses the XGBoost model.
From the partial dependence plots, we can see that when the number of accommodates, bathrooms,
bedrooms, or cleaning fees increases, the average prediction increase (higher price). Combining domain
knowledge, we can say that the PDPs are accurate because usually, Airbnb homes with more
accommodates, bathrooms, bedrooms, higher cleaning fees charge a higher price.
The graph below shows the ten most important features in the test set of the Airbnb dataset.
‘Room_type: Entire home/apt’, ‘accommodates’, and ‘cleaning_fee’ are the TOP 3 most important
features that can determine the price of an Airbnb home. To evaluate the permutation importances using
domain knowledge, we can say that the important features make a lot of sense because people usually pay
more for things like an entire home, more accommodates, or a home that charges higher cleaning_fee.
4.1.2 Local Explanations
In this section, we will present examples of local explanations for an individual in the healthcare dataset
and an individual in the loan dataset that uses the XGBoost model.
Example from Healthcare dataset
The graph below shows the LIME for one individual in the test set of the
healthcare
dataset. This
individual is a Caucasian female with steady insulin who is taking diabetes medications. The predicted
outcome for this individual is 0, which means that this individual is predicted to not be readmitted to the
hospital. According to the graph, we can tell that not being a Hispanic contributes the most to being
predicted to class 0, then is not being an African American.
The graph below shows the Shapley values for the same individual in the healthcare dataset.
From the graph above, we can see that the average prediction is -0.16, and the actual prediction for this
individual is -0.412. And not on Diabetes Med has the most effect of dragging the prediction closer to
-0.412. Being a Caucasian has the most effect of dragging the prediction the most closer to -0.16.
Example from loan dataset
The individual that we choose for the
loan
dataset
is predicted to be a defaulter. To see the complete
attributes of this individual, please go to
T a b l e
1
in the
appendix
.
According to the graph above, we can see that not working in a religion-related organization contributes
the most to being predicted to a defaulter, and not working in a realtor-related organization has the most
negative impact on being predicted to a defaulter.
The graph below shows the Shapley values for the same individual in the loan dataset.
From the graph above, we can see that the average prediction is 0.001, and the actual prediction for this
individual is 0.138. Except for the features that are determined by an external source (‘EXT_SOURCE_3’
and ‘EXT_SOURCE_2’), having a 270000 amount of credit has the most effect of dragging the prediction
closer to 0.001. And working in a restaurant organization has the most effect of dragging the prediction
closer to 0.138.
4.2 Fairness Evaluations
For the result of the fairness evaluation we present one example for each evaluation method to showcase
the process and outcome for those methods. In each example, we pick a dataset, a model, and a sensitive
variable, which a fair model should be unbiased to. In other words, the model should rely on these
variables to make its prediction, introducing discrimination against a protected class. The set of sensitive
depends on the task and is often required to be determined with domain knowledge. For example, gender
might be a sensitive variable in many cases, but in health care, gender might be an important predictor of
certain diseases. In the following examples, we assume the selected sensitive variables are indeed
sensitive for the corresponding task. Another assumption we made is that our dataset represents the
population. All the evaluations are made on a separate test dataset that the model hasn’t been exposed to.
4.2.1 Group Fairness
The model we evaluate is the SVM classifier trained on the loan data and the sensitive variable is gender.
In this test, we measure the probability of the model giving a positive prediction on male and female
individuals. A fair model should rely on the sensitive variable and thus should have the same average
prediction on the two groups. The trained SVM classifier has a 0.61 average prediction on the female
subjects and 0.7 on the male subjects. The expectation difference is about 0.09. In other words, the model
has a bias toward giving male loan borrowers a higher default probability. Therefore, we concluded that
the SVM classifier is not fair.
4.2.2 Predictive Parity
The model we evaluate is the XGBoost classifier trained on the loan data. The sensitive variable we
picked is marital status, a binary variable indicating if the borrower is married. It is debatable whether
marital status is a sensitive variable in loan default prediction. In this experiment, we assume it is and we
compute the predictive parity between the married individual and the not married. We compute the true
positive rate of the model on the two groups. A fair model should have the same true positive rate on both
groups. The not married group has a true positive rate of 0.675 while the married group has a true positive
rate of 0.674. The predictivity difference is only 0.001. The model has similar predictive power on the
two groups of individuals. Therefore, we conclude that the model is fair in terms of marital status under
the predictive parity test.
4.2.3 Conditional Frequencies
The model we evaluate is the XGBoost classifier trained on the Airbnb dataset. We randomly generate the
owner’s gender and use it as the sensitive variable. The generated gender is not correlated with the targetat all. The correlation coefficient of the two variables is 0.02. The result is shown in the figure below.
Each bar of the figure represents the true probability of an instance being positive given that the model
prediction is within a certain range. From the graph, we can see that when the model’s prediction is within
the 0.4~0.6 bin or the 0.6~0.8 bin, male Airbnb host has a significantly lower true probability of being in
a positive class. In other words, the model overpredicted on instances with the male owners. Hence, the
model is unfair.
4.2.4 Causal Discrimination
In this experiment, the model we evaluate is the TabNet classifier trained on the Loan dataset and the
sensitive variable is gender. We flip the gender of all the instances and measure the average prediction
change for each gender. After only flipping the gender feature, 21.0% of the instances have their
prediction changed. Changing the gender of the loan borrower from female to male increases the
prediction by 11.2% on average, and changing the gender from male to female decreases the prediction by
9.6% on average. The result indicates that the model is unfair and relies on gender to make its prediction.
The model is biased toward giving male loan borrowers a higher prediction of default probability. The
result confirmed our findings in the Group Fairness experiment. Both models show the same bias, which
suggested the dataset is biased. We find that the dataset indeed has a 0.1 correlation between gender and
whether the loan defaults. The extent of the bias, 10%, aligned with the result of the Causal
Discrimination test and Group Fairness test.
4.3 False Positive and False Negative Explanations
We analyzed both false positives and false negatives predictions of multiple black-box models on various
datasets. In this section, we will be using the results found in the Airbnb dataset as an example of our
analysis.
We started with explanations of false-negative (FN) predictions. We modified the label and set it to values
0 and 1, where value 1 represents that the prediction of a model is FN and value 0 presents that the
prediction of a model is not FN. The same procedure applies to FP explanations as well. Then, using the
domain knowledge, we constructed a simple causal graph below with several features of interest.
To clarify, the node in green is the outcome we are interested in, the nodes in blue are the features of
interests, and the arrows denote the causal relationship between two nodes. For example, the
accommodates, which is the maximum capacity of a listing, might cause a predictor to predict false
negatives, and beds, which is the number of beds in the listing, might be a common cause of both
accommodates and FN outcomes. To determine if this is the case, we used the DoWhy, an end-to-end
library to do causal inference, to identify the causal effect, estimate the identified estimand, and verify the
results.
Here is an example of how the feature “accommodates” causes the SVC model to predict false negatives.
First, the DoWhy causal model sets the feature “accommodates” to be the treatment and identifies the
confounder “beds” using the backdoor criterion. Then, the DoWhy causal model simulates the
randomized experiment by adjusting the influence of some confounding variables Z, and it is “beds” in
this case. The adjustment formula is presented by
=
. After identifying the𝑝(𝑃|𝑑𝑜(𝑇))𝑧∑𝑝(𝑌|𝑇, 𝑍)𝑝(𝑍)
estimand, the DoWhy causal model estimates the estimand using the Average Treatment Effect (ATE),
and the result is about 0.065. Thus, having a higher maximum capacity in a listing increases the chance of
the SVC predicting FN. To validate the result, we use two refutation tests. The first one is called Random
Common Cause which adds randomly drawn covariates to data and re-runs the analysis to see if the
causal estimate changes or not. If our assumption was originally correct then the causal estimate shouldn’t
change by much. In this case, the estimated effect and the new effect are about the same. The second test
is called Data Subset Refuter which creates subsets of the data(similar to cross-validation) and checks
whether the causal estimates vary across subsets. If our assumptions were correct there shouldn’t be many
variations. In our example, the estimated effect and the new effect is not significantly different according
to the p-value. We can see that our estimate passes all refutation tests. This does not prove its correctness,
but it increases confidence in the estimate.
In conclusion, after the causal inference, we can say that having a higher maximum capacity in a listing
increases the chance of the SVC predicting FN. This is intuitive because a listing with a higher maximum
capacity is more likely to be expensive in reality, so the model will give FN predictions if the model fails
to capture this positive correlation.
Here is another example of how room type causes the LGBM model to predict false positives.The same procedure used to generate causal inference for the previous example applies here as well. The
DoWhy model first sets the “room_type” to be the treatment and identifies the cofounder “property_type”
and tries to estimate. Then, it estimates the ATE to be around 0.077. So, the predictor tends to give FP
predictions if the room type is the entire home/apt. The estimate also passes all refutation tests. Again,
this does not prove its correctness, but it increases confidence in the estimate. The result makes sense
because if a model puts too much weight on the room type, it will predict the higher prices for listings
with an entire place, while this is not always the case in reality. Sometimes a shared place could be more
expensive than an entire apartment depending on the location and other factors.
4.4 Counterfactual Recourse
We generated counterfactual recourse explanations for an individual from the loan dataset negatively
impacted by the model’s prediction. The individual was a male, approximately 32 years old, was
unemployed, did not own a car, did not own a home, did not possess higher education, and was classified
by the model as a loan defaulter. There were several actionable attributes that the individual could have
taken action on to avoid being classified as a loan defaulter.
Actionable Attribute
Current Value
Required Value
‘NAME_INCOME_TYPE: 
Unemployed’
1
0
‘FLAG_OWN_CAR: N’
1
0
‘NAME_HOUSING_TYPE: 
Rented apartment’
1
0
‘NAME_EDUCATION_TYPE: 
Higher Education’
0
1
To significantly decrease the likelihood of being a loan defaulter, the individual should be employed.
Employment status is a significant predictor in the model and negatively affects unemployed individuals.
The individual should also prove homeownership and car ownership when applying for a loan to decrease
their likelihood of being classified as a loan defaulter. In addition, the individual should apply for a loan
when they have obtained the highest educational level possibly, ideally higher education. The educational
level of an applicant is an attribute that affects their income status and homeownership status, and is,
therefore, a major predictor in the model.

1 INTRODUCTION
Automated Machine Learning(AutoML) has grown in popularity
recently as it has enabled scalable ML for the masses. Currently
the machine learning pipeline has a lot of manual steps such as
data preprocessing and model building. AutoML platforms and soft-
ware aim to automate the entire ML pipeline. Many such platforms
already exist such as Amazon Sagemaker, Google Cloud AutoML,
Salesforce Einstein and more. As a result the different steps involved
in the AutoML pipeline are heavily researched in academia as well.
The first step AutoML software must take after loading in a
dataset is to identify the feature types (ie numeric, categorical,
datetime, ...) of individual columns in the input data. This feature
type inference information allows the software to understand the
data and preprocess it to allow machine learning algorithms to run
on it. Feature type inference is still being done manually by data
scientists which in most cases becomes impractical as dataset can
have hundreds or more features that require labeling. Previous tools
have also implemented automated Feature Type Inference using
rules-based prediction.
Project Sortinghat of the ADA lab at UCSD frames this task of
Feature Type Inference as a machine learning multiclass classifi-
cation problem. Machine learning models defined in the original
SortingHat feature type inference paper[ 4] use 3 sets of features as
input.
(1) The name of the given column
(2) 5 sample values from the data to be used as base features
(3)Descriptive numeric statistics computed from the entire
given column (Listed in Table 1)
The textual features such as the column name and the 5 sample
values are easy to access, however the descriptive statistics models
rely on a full iteration through every row and value in the data
which make preprocessing less scalable as the dataset size grows.
Our goal is to investigate 2 questions about feature type inference.
(1)Can we take the Random Forest Model from Project Sort-
inghat and investigate how adjusting the number of base
feature sample values or taking a subsection of the data for
descriptive statistic calculation affects the model?
(2)Can we experiment with and apply deep learning trans-
former models to feature type inference to improve accu-
racy and scalability further?
1.1 Previous Work
Project SortingHat produced the ML Data Prep Zoo which is a
collection of publicly available datasets. The zoo also includes all the
precomputed features defined above as labeled benchmark data for
feature type inference. This data plays a role in this space similiar
to ImageNet in computer vision allowing the benchmarking of
existing tools on this task. For our investigation, we have used theTable 1: Set of Descriptive Statistics

original data from the ML Data Prep Zoo; both the raw csv’s of data
as well as the benchmark labeled data to train and test our models
with.
The SortingHat paper also proposed and used a set of 9 class la-
bels; details of these labels can be found in Table 11 of the appendix.
We continue to use these 9 class labels for our models as labeled in
the benchmark dataset. The experiments observed in the original
SortingHat paper produced models that outperform the accuracy
of existing tools such as AWS’s AutoGluon, Google’s Tensorflow
Data Validation, the Pandas python library, and more. The single
best model produced by this paper was a random forest model that
uses the column name and descriptive statistics that yielded an
Accuracy of 0.9265 .
2 METHODS
2.1 Random Forest Investigation
As mentioned above, Project SortingHat’s best performing model
was a Random Forest that achieved an accuracy of 0.9265 overall
and class wise accuracy shown in Table 2. This was generated
using 5 sample values from the data column as base features and
using the Table 1 set of descriptive statistics calculated using the
entire data column. To further investigate the performance of thisTanveer Mittal and Andrew Shen

random forest model and to answer the first question on feature
type inference we will be adjusting both the number of sample
values used as base features and the subset of data used to calculate
the descriptive statistics.
2.1.1 Adjusting Number of Sample Values Used in the Base
Feature Set .To investigate ways of improving model runtime and
accuracy, we will first experiment with adjusting the number of
sample values used as base features. The original Random Forest
Model was trained using 5 sample values, but for our experiment
we tested using 1,2,3,4,5, and 10 sample values as base features. As
expected, when using 5 sample values in the base feature set, our
model is exactly the same as the original SortingHat Random Forest
and produces the same accuracy values.
What is discovered in Table 3 is that the Random Forest accuracy
is not noticable affected by either an increase or decrease in the
number of sample values used in the base feature set. Between
using only 1 random sample from the data column as a base fea-
ture to using 10 random samples as base feature that accuracy did
not change more than 1%. For for metrics, a full 9 class Accuracy,
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score table is available in the appendix at
Table 12.
Additionally, increasing the number of sample values used as
base features did not have as much of an impact on the model
runtime as expected. As shown in Table 13 found in the appendix,
we measured the time it took to train and test the model across
all 1 though 5 and 10 base feature sample values over 3 iterations.
Between including only 1 sample value as a base feature compared
to including 10 samples as a base feature, there was a less than 1%
time increase between 1 and 10 sample models.
2.1.2 Adjusting Percentage of Data Column Used in the Cal-
culation of Descriptive Statistics .A time consuming step of the
feature type inference process is the calculation of descriptive sta-
tistics. As referenced in Table 1, all the descriptive statistics require
a complete iteration to calculate the values used in the ML model.
Our experiment involves taking subsets of data, sampled randomly
Figure 1: Benchmark Labeled Data Runtimes
without replacement, from the entire data column at 10% intervals
(ie 90%, 80%, ...). For example if a data column has 1,000 values
and we are taking a 50% subset, we would sample 500 values to
use in the calculation of our descriptive statistics. This will reduce
the number of value that we will have to iterate over, increasing
the calculation speed of the descriptive statistics. The downside is
the loss of information and inaccuracy in the descriptive statistics
caused by now using all available values in the data column. In this
experiment we are keeping the 5 sample values in the base feature
set as we have seen they do not have much of an effect on either
accuracy or runtime.
As seen in Table 4, there is a constant decrease in model accuracy
as we lower the proportion of the data we are using to calculate our
descriptive statistics with. For more detailed metrics, Table 5 shows
the class wise metrics across the different proportions we are taking
from the data column. From Table 5 we can see that Categorical sees
the largest decrease in accuracy as we take a smaller proportion
of the entire data set for descriptive statistic calculation, with not-
generalizable and context-specific feature types also affected. This
makes sense as these feature types require looking at much moreFeature Type Inference Capstone Tech Report

of the data compared to feature types such as URL or datetime.
Confusion matricies for the 10%, 50%, and 90% subsets can be found
in Table 14-16 in the appendix.
Although accuracy increases as we use more of the data column
for descriptive statistic calculation, so does the runtime. Figure 1
displays the change in runtime of the descriptive statistic calculation
as used for the benchmark labeled data test set. Though the training
set has more columns and features to calculate, the test and train
runtimes follow the same linear pattern as we adjust the proportion
of data we subset. In the calculation of the benchmark labeled data,
the descriptive statistic runtime is only affected by the number ofvalues in the data column that we are inferring the feature of. As
we adjust what percentage of the data column we subset for our
statistic calculations, there is a linear decrease in runtime. Using
Table 4, Table 5, and Figure 1, we can adjust how to best balance
optimizing runtime through only selecting a percentage of the
entire data column for the descriptive statistics and our accuracy
requirements. The runtimes of all three iterations can be found in
Table 17 in the appendix.Tanveer Mittal and Andrew Shen

2.2 Transformer Models
In the hopes of creating more accurate and scalable models, we
applied deep learning transformer models to feature type inference.
We are using transformers to generate contextualized embeddings
for words present in the column name and sample values of a col-
umn. As transformers currently produce state of the art results
on natural language processing tasks, we hypothesise transformer
models will be able to perform well on feature type inference be-
cause of their ability to generate contexualized word embeddings.
This means that embeddings will be encoded with relevant infor-
mation from other words in the same sequence. We believe these
models will be able to better leverage the column names and sample
values in context to each other.
In this project we specifically experimented with the Bidirec-
tional Encoding and Representation Transformer(BERT)[ 1] model
pretrained by Google to generate embeddings.
To preprocess the column names and samples values we con-
catenated them and used separation([SEP]) tokens between them.
These single strings are then tokenized using the HuggingFace
transformers library. Our original model architecture can be seen
in Figure 2. BERT receives the text and then outputs a sequence of
embeddings of size 768.
We then use a convolution neural network architecture to pro-
cess BERT’s embeddings. This is inspired from a paper that uses
BERT with a CNN for offensive speech classification[ 3]. In this
original model, the sequence of embeddings is fed into 5 separate
convolution layers that are processed with pooling and activation
functions in parallel. The intuition behind this operation is that
the different convolution filter dimensions can analyze different
types of ngrams present in our data. Theoretically this model is able
analyze individual words, bigrams, trigams, and more. The output
of these operations are then concatenated and flattened. This con-
volution output is then concatenated with the descriptive statistics
and fed into a softmax dense layer to output a classification.
Figure 2: Diagram of transformer and full CNN architecture
2.3 Architecture Experiments
This architecture has components that can be adjusted so we de-
cided to run a series of experiments to identify the best combination
of convolution blocks and kernel size our CNN can use for this task.
We first decided to run an ablation experiment where we remove
individual convolution blocks and then observe the difference in
accuracy from our original model using all 5 convolution blocks.
From table 6, we observe that the best performing combination of
convolution blocks is [1, 2, 3, 5]. Once we identified this we also ran
an additional ablation shown in table 7 to see if we could increase
accuracy any further from removing certain blocks but we did not
observe any further improvements.
In addition to identifying the best architecture of convolution
blocks for our model, these experiments have been helpful in identi-
fying which filter dimensions perform best on our data. From tableFeature Type Inference Capstone Tech Report

filters reported in Table 6.

release.

6, we could observe that removing filters 1 & 3 decreased model per-
formance where as every other filter’s removal increased accuracy.
This suggests that our model finds the most value from analyzing
individual words and trigrams. Alongside these experiments and a
grid search of kernel sizes we determine that our best architecture
documented in figure 3 uses the combination of blocks [1, 2, 3, 5]
and a kernel size of 256 for all convolution blocks. The accuracy,
precision, and recall of our best model’s predictions on individual
data types are documented in Table 11 located in the appendix.
Figure 3: Diagram of transformer and best CNN architecture2.4 Feature Set Experiment
To analyze the importance of different feature sets, we decided to
run an ablation experiment for different combinations of feature
sets these models are trained on. We could not run an experiment
only using descriptive statistics as this would not use a transformer
model in our architecture, so every other combination’s results are
documented in Table 9
We can observe in these results that BERT is better at analyz-
ing the textual features than any of the models from the original
SortingHat paper[ 4]. The sample values are suggested here to be
the single most important feature for our model. This supports
our hypothesis by suggesting that BERT is effectively leveraging
sample values with the context of each other. Our best model from
this experiment is still the one using all of our features, however
unlike the results from original SortingHat paper, the accuracy
improvement of using the descriptive statistics is very small. In fact
our model that only uses column names and sample values still
outperforms the previous best random forest model; this also scales
better as it does not require a full pass through the data to generate
descriptive statistics.Tanveer Mittal and Andrew Shen
3 CONCLUSION
From the experiments on the Random Forest model, we saw that
the addition/removal of sample values used as base features how
no significant impact on both the model accuracy and runtimes.
What did have a impact on the model was the use of data subsets
when calculating the descriptive statistics. As we took smaller and
smaller subsets from the data to calculate the descriptive statistics,
we saw runtime decrease linearly, but model accuracy drop as well
which was expected but good to verify and allows us to further
experiment with finding ways to balance the two in the future.
We can also see that transformer models are very effective at
Feature Type Inference. Our models now outperform all existing
tools and models benchmarked against the ML Data Prep Zoo. Fur-
thermore we can see there is great potential in applying more state
of the art natural language processing techniques to this task to
increase performance and rely less on descriptive statistics to pro-
duce scalable models. As a result, we decided to release 2 models;
our best model that uses descriptive statistics and our model that
does not use descriptive statistics. These models are now available
for easy use through the PyTorch Hub API to allow for easy inte-
gration of our models into AutoML platforms or other applications
of automated data preparation.
This project produced promising results but with the limited time
span of the . Further work in this area can involve experimenting
with more CNN architectures than the one we defined and trying
other state of the art language models which are trained on more
data such as RoBERTa[2], XLNet[5] or others.

0 Abstract
In machine learning, models are commonly built in such a way to avoid what is known as
overfitting. As it is generally understood, overfitting is when a model is fit exactly to the training
data causing the model to have poor performance on new examples. This means that overfit
models tend to have poor accuracy on unseen data because the model is fit exactly to the
training data. Therefore, in order to generalize to all examples of data and not only the
examples found in a given training set, models are built with certain techniques to avoid fitting
the data exactly. However, it can be found that overfitting does not always work in this way that
one might expect as will be shown by fitting models with a given level of noisiness. Specifically,
it is seen that some models fit exactly to data with high levels of noise still produce results with
high accuracy whereas others are more prone to overfitting.
1 Introduction
In our domain, we have studied recent papers that have rigorously shown the effects of building
a model that has been heavily over-parameterized. Such models are often trained to have zero
or near zero training loss, leading to believe that such models would be overfit and therefore
generalize poorly to unknown test datasets. However, we were able to discover that this
problem does not occur but rather the models still perform as well on test data as a non-overfit
model. Furthermore, in some cases, we were able to observe that a model that would typically
be considered overfit performs even better than a model built with the pretense of avoiding
overfitting (
“Reconciling Modern Machine-Learning
Practice”
).
This concept of purposefully overfitting a model opposes the traditional bias-variance trade-off
paradigm that is well-known in data science, where a bit of error rate is left in the training phase
in order to prevent the model from being too biased on the dataset. In quarter one, we
attempted to replicate the empirical results from a related paper using the MNIST handwriting
recognition dataset with Laplacian and Gaussian kernel machines (
""To understand deep
learning we need to understand kernel learning”). We were able to reproduce these results,
scoring near 100% on testing accuracy on the test data with the overfitted model.
For our project in quarter two, we investigated
the
effects of noise and data corruption on the
accuracy of multiple different types of overfitted models. These models include Laplacian /
Gaussian kernel machines, k-Nearest Neighbor classification, decision trees, logistic regression,
and neural networks. This study is interesting because if a model that is overfit on corrupted
data performs near-optimally on test data (once the noise is accounted for), overfitting of the
dataset with many parameters may become the new paradigm of machine learning— not
leaving any error in the training phase.There are results from previous literature pertaining specifically to kernel machines and noise
levels and we included their replication with the rest of our results to present a full picture of
models interacting with corrupted data (
""To understand
deep learning we need to understand
kernel learning”)
. Additionally, research into generalization
error for convolutional neural
networks has been done but there is room for a more detailed, clearer investigation into the
effect corrupt data and noise has on model accuracy (Zhang).
2 Methodology
Our project was implemented in Python. We have primarily focused on testing models with the
MNIST dataset and other image datasets, as well as creating our own synthetic datasets. We
have used these datasets to train the Laplacian and Gaussian kernel machines, k-nearest
neighbor classifiers, random forests, and neural networks. To compare our results across
datasets and models, we used graphical representations of accuracy for ease analysis.
2.1 Corruption Filters
The first form of corruption applied to the data we used is label corruption. In doing so, a set
proportion of randomly selected labels are given a new label in a uniformly random manner. For
example, in the case of the MNIST dataset, an image that has been chosen to have its label
randomized would be reassigned a value between 0 and 9, meaning that such image would
have a ten percent chance of being reassigned the correct label. In a more general sense, this
would similarly apply to any other dataset in which the chance of being reassigned the correct
label would be equal to 1 in the number of labels in the dataset.
Another form of corruption we used is random corruption. Unlike label corruption, random
corruption targets the actual data while keeping the labels clean. In this process, each data
point has a set proportion of its dimensions reassigned uniformly at random (shown in Figure 1).
Again using the MNIST dataset as an example, this would mean that if a pixel in the image were
to be randomized, it would be reassigned a completely random value spanning from the
minimum value possible to the maximum value possible. Similar to label corruption, this means
that each randomized value has the possibility to be reassigned the original value, however the
chance of such an occurrence is much more rare than that of label randomization.

Using this formula, we created kernel machine implementations in Python for data corruption
analysis.
3 Results + Analysis
In terms of exactly fitting a model with corrupted values, it would generally be expected that the
resulting performance on uncorrupted testing data would be inversely proportional to the
proportion of corruption in the dataset. However, given that it is expected for real world data to
naturally be messy or corrupted, it would be beneficial to create models that can still perform
well despite being trained with incorrect data. Therefore, we can compare different models
trained with different levels and types of corruption to see what models produce this kind of
effect.
3.1 Label Corruption Results
When looking solely at the performance of the kernel machines (Figure 2), there is no clear
winner in terms of which kernel function is the best. However, from this data, it can be observed
that certain models perform better under different circumstances. More specifically, it is shown
that kernel machines with high power kernel functions have the best performance on extremely
clean data, however they fail on messier datasets. On the other hand, kernel machines with low
power kernel functions sacrifice some of the initial performance on clean data. However, they
end up being much more resistant to the effects of corruption, resulting in higher accuracy fromcorrupted data than kernel machines with high power kernel functions. Therefore, in order to get
the best performance out of a model, it becomes important to understand the initial data and
how messy it is expected to be. For example, if one expects that the given dataset is quite
messy, it would be in the best interest to use a low power kernel function whereas if it is known
that the dataset is clean, it would be in the best interest to use a high power kernel function.
Figure 2 - Kernel machines trained with label corruption (MNIST)
In a similar sense to kernel machines, k-nearest neighbors (Figure 3) has no outright best
performing model in terms of how many neighbors are used in the classification process. In
terms of what is most resistant to corruption, it is clear that having a large number of neighbors
is beneficial. However, it can also be observed that having a high number of neighbors results in
worse initial performance on a clean dataset. This is likely due to the fact that in classifiers with
lower numbers of neighbors, there is a larger chance that the closest neighbors to a new data
point will be corrupted as the corruption proportion increases.
Figure 3 - k-Nearest Neighbors trained with label corruption (MNIST)
In contrast to both kernel machines and k-nearest neighbors, random forests (Figure 4) do have
a clear winner in terms of the best performing model. At all levels of corruption, it can be seen
that forests with larger numbers of trees always outperforms those with less trees, regardless of
corruption level. Therefore, this becomes a simpler problem in terms of choosing how to build a
random forest even without knowing about how messy the dataset may or may not be. However
it should also be noted that adding trees to a random forest increases the level of computational
complexity of the model whereas in a model such as kernel machines, changing the power of
the kernel function in a kernel machine is relatively equal regardless of its power.
Figure 4 - Random forests trained with label corruption (MNIST)
Unlike the previous model types, only one model was used for the neural networks, however in
order to view the effects of corruption on them, testing accuracy was calculated after training the
network for a certain number of epochs. By doing so, it can be seen that such a model is very
prone to overfitting. However, by using early stopping, the same model can perform well on a
testing set when trained with high levels of corruption. Looking at Figure 5, it is seen that
continuously training a neural network either increases, or keeps the results roughly the same,
whereas even at 10% corruption, training for too long tends to fit the corrupted data resulting in
an immediate decrease in testing accuracy, whereas with the use of early stopping, the network
does not begin to see a large decrease in performance until around 60% corruption.
Figure 5 - Neural Networks trained with label corruption (MNIST)
When comparing the performance of each different kind of model, there is no exact answer for
what is the universally best model to use, as each different model has clear positives and
negatives to them. On one hand, it may seem ideal to use random forests because it has the
advantage of its best performing model working the best on both clean and messy data.
However, in terms of the exact values of accuracy, it can be observed that certain kernels have
better performance in certain conditions. For example, the kernels with higher power kernel
functions have better performance than the forests with very clean data, whereas kernels with
lower power kernel functions outperform the trees at higher levels of corruption. All in all, this
highlights the importance of model selection based on a general understanding of the dataset
being worked with. Also, in the case where it is difficult to tell if the data is messy or not, models
such as the random forest allow for good general use.
3.2 Random Corruption Results
When looking at the performance of the kernel machines (Figure 6), models with a power of 2
(Gaussian) perform best of all implementations tested. In contrast to the performance of kernel
machines trained with label corruption, when trained with random corruption the resistance to
corruption across all powers of kernel functions are relatively the same. The big difference
however is that in this case kernel machines with higher power kernel functions have higher
performance whereas when trained with label corruption the kernels with high power kernel
functions were more prone to overfitting.
Figure 6 - Kernel machines trained with random data corruption (MNIST)
Out of the different k-Nearest Neighbor models that we tested, the model with the highest
number of neighbors performed the worst initially, however ended up being the most resistant to
the effects of random corruption. In contrast, the model with the lowest number of neighbors
performed best on completely clean data however had a more significant drop off in accuracy
with the addition of corruption compared to the models with a higher number of neighbors.
Figure 7 - k-Nearest Neighbors trained with random data corruption (MNIST)
Like the performance of random forests trained with label corruption, random forests trained
with random corruption show that having a large number of trees in the forests is explicitly better
than having fewer numbers of trees. However, it can also be seen that when trained this way,
the random forest model is not as resistant to the effects of corruption as the other types of
models. In comparison to the other models, the random forests have a more significant
decrease in accuracy as corruption is added, similar to the decrease in accuracy seen with
kernels.
Figure 8 - Random forests trained with random data corruption (MNIST)
In contrast to the performance of neural networks trained with label corruption, when trained
with random corruption, the performance of neural networks is generally increased when
continuously training for more epochs (for example at 60% - 70% corruption). However, it can
also be seen that there is a very slight decrease in accuracy at higher levels of corruption,
meaning that early stopping could also be used in this case, however it is not nearly as
necessary to the extent of that for label corruption. This means that as the network is
continuously trained, it does begin to overfit to the training set, however it can also be noted that
such a fit is not detrimental to the performance of the network on the testing set.
Figure 9 - Neural Networks trained with random data corruption (MNIST)
Overall, it can be seen that the effects of fitting randomly corrupted data with clean labels has
less of an effect on model building than doing the reverse. Specifically it can be seen that
overfitting occurs in some variation of each model when trained with label corruption whereas
the only significant case of overfitting with random corruption occurs in the random forest model.
As for which model works the best, there are again no clear winners. In the case of completely
clean data, it can be seen that neural networks and kernel machines generally have the best
performance while k-nearest neighbors appear to have the most resistance to randomly
corrupted data.
4 Conclusion
To sum up, from the insight that models that are overfit on the training data do not actually
perform worse on the testing data when compared to models that leave training error, we added
the factor of corrupted data. To test the effects of corrupted data on the performance of our
models on the testing data, we utilized multiple different types of models and multiple datasets.
From the initial Laplacian and Gaussian kernel machines trained on the MNIST handwriting
image dataset, we further implemented the K-Nearest Neighbor classifier, random forest, and
logistic regression model. (Neural Networks are to be implemented soon). On each model, we
trained it on one dataset for each model while gradually increasing the proportion of the dataset
that was corrupted through label corruption or random corruption.
From the performance results we were able to comprehend that each model had different
strengths and weaknesses. From the kernel machines, we were able to conclude that the power
of the kernel functions were a key factor in deciding its performance in relation to the corruption
level of the dataset. The higher the power, the better its performance was on clean datasets and
less resistant to data corruption— meaning that as the data became corrupted, it rapidly
decreased in accuracy. The lower the power of the kernel function, the more resistant it was to
data corruption— leading to significantly better performance of accuracy than the higher power
kernel functions when trained on the same level of data corruption.
The K-Nearest Neighbors classifier also gave similar results. The higher the number of
neighbors, the more resistant it was to data corruption. The opposite gave result to less
resistance and better accuracy on the initial clean dataset.
However, from the results, we were able to observe that this was not the case for random
forests. The higher the number of trees the better the accuracy was on every level of data
corruption, but at the cost of higher computation cost.
Thus, from the results so far, we were able to learn that since each model has strengths and
weaknesses according to the value of the optimized parameter, there is no one ultimate or ideal
model to every dataset. We further concluded that to output the best results in terms of
performance of accuracy on the testing/unseen data, it is crucial to understand how much the
training data is corrupted, so that the adequate model would be selected.References

ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic that has persisted for more
than two years has been combated
by ef ficient testing strategies that reliably identifies positive individuals to slow the spread of the
pandemic. Opposed to other pooling strategies within the domain, the methods described in this
paper prioritize true negative samples over overall accuracy . In the Monte Carlo simulations,
both nonadaptive and adaptive testing strategies with random pool sampling resulted in high
accuracy approaching at least 95% with varying pooling sizes and population sizes to decrease
the number of tests given. A split tensor rank 2 method attempts to identify all infected samples
within 961 samples, conver ging the number of tests to 99 as the prevalence of infection
conver ges to 1%.

INTRODUCTION
COVID-19 rapid tests have been the primary method
of identifying positive individuals
to slow the spread of the pandemic, but this process is inef ficiently rate-limited by not only the
thousands of tests run each day , but also the resource cost to run these samples individually . Each
rapid test can take up to
6 hours to run in the laboratory[1],
which can quickly be delayed based
on the sheer number of daily tests given each day . Instead of running individual tests, a
group-testing schema, proposed by Robert Dorfman during the Second World War, combined
multiple individual samples to form one cohesive pool that is tested once[2]. If a positive test is
returned, one test is wasted and the group would be retested again, but if a negative test is
returned, several tests are conserved as every member in the pool is labeled as negative.
Although this pooling method conserves tests, researchers are determining a way to
efficiently optimize testing strategies in an ef fort to reduce the number of tests while retaining
high accuracy . Such papers demonstrating algorithms such as Tapestry[3] and 2-Step Adaptive
Pooling [4] demonstrate two prominent pooling strategies: nonadaptive and adaptive pooling
schemes. In a nonadaptive scheme, the entire pooling strategy from start to finish is decided prior
to analyzing the samples, while in an adaptive pooling method, the pooling strategy changes
depending on the results of the prior results.2

In addition, a graphing strategy was tested in this report. Because real COVID data is
limited, how credible is the result of this model on simulated data? If the model is tested on
actual data in the future, how dif ferent will this result be from the existing data result?
The most significant dif ference between simulated and real data is that all simulated test
data are independent: there is no connection between them. In other words, their chances of
being pooled and infected are unrelated. Obviously , in reality , this is untrue. Each person has
their own social circle and social network. When a person is infected, they are most likely to
infect someone within their social network. Unlike the simulated data where everyone is
independent of each other , the reality is that when a person is infected, the probability of
infecting a family member should not be the same as a randomly selected person outside their
social network. Therefore, a social network model of COVID-19 was created for more practical
model testing and training in this report. To combine network information with testing methods,
the network was analyzed to prioritize critical nodes and high-risk nodes for contracting
COVID-19.
In our project, we tried the SEIR infectious disease model (Figure 1)  at first. This model
divides the population into four categories: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infectious (I), and
Recovered (R) groups [6]. To explore this graphing strategy , we use degree centrality to assess
critical nodes, and a degree centrality testing method is used to find out the positives.
[Figure 1: Disease states of
SEIR model
]
To advance our project, we employed the extended-SEIR model which divided the
subpopulation Infectious group (I) into pre-symptomatic (Ipre), asymptomatic (Iasym),
symptomatic (Isym), and hospitalized (H) (Figure 1.1). We prefer extended model because this
takes into account the latent period of the virus and dif ferent transmission rates in dif ferent
symptomatic stages in Covid-19: the symptomatic individual has a dif ferent degree of contagion
3
o f
2 4
than asymptomatic individual, and asymptomatic people, who do not have the symptom, will not
go into the hospitalized stage.
In this model, there are eight states of individuals in the spread of the disease: when a
person is exposed to the virus, they change from the susceptible state (S) to the exposed state (E).
When the virus develops in the body (Ipre) for a while (incubation period), they will be infected
and become a patient. However , the COVID-19 patient may develop symptoms (Isym) or not
(Iasym). Symptomatic patients with severity will be hospitalized (H) and will either recover (R)
or die (D). On the other hand, Mild patients will recover after a while.
[Figure 1.1: Disease states of extended-SEIR model]
Besides the infectious disease model, the community contact and demographic
connection is also considered in this project. The disease model is a good network for simulating
the spreading processes of the disease, but it fails to address the complex social connections
among dif ferent communities. For example, the level of contacts or connections within the
households should be dif ferent from that of out-of-household contacts, as household connections
are more intimate than others. Therefore the success rate of disease transmission should not be
the same in these two places. The success rate of transmission at home should be much higher
than that of other social places, like schools and workspaces.
To address this problem, a demographic model is employed in this project (Figure 1.2).
This model not only includes the community-level connections, but also other realistic
demographic properties like age-stratification and household sizes, calibrated with the US
demographic statistics. Moreover , this demographic model also generates separate layers of
4
o f
2 4
network to mimic out-of-household regular contacts in dif ferent age groups. For example, there
is a separate contacting network for people whose age is between 10 and 19 which represents
secondary school community contacts. With these demographic information, combined with
infectious disease network information, we create a machine learning pooling strategy . The more
detailed explanation is discussed in the method section.
[Figure 1.2: Households and age group layers of the demographic model]
Another strategy explored in this report is a tensor pooling strategy . Tensors
(mathematical objects relaying arrays to the coordinates in space) are used in this method to
compute the pooling matrix of our samples. An example of this is using a tensor of rank 2 (a
matrix) with a sample size of 64. The tensor will be of size
by
) where
n𝑐𝑒𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔(𝑟𝑛)𝑐𝑒𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔(𝑟𝑛
is the number of samples and r is the rank of the tensor , thus creating a tensor with dimensions 8
by 8. By placing samples in order inside our tensor , each sample has a unique row and column
combination. Thus, we can consider each row and column as a pool within our pooling matrix.
III.
METHODS
Pooling Strategies
To simulate COVID testing, a matrix-based analysis
was used as the primary testing
strategy . Given a matrix denoting which samples belong to a pooled test, each row representing a
pooled test would contain either a 0 (the sample is not in the pool) or a 1 (the sample is in the
pool). If at least 1 person in this pool is COVID positive, the output-tested vector would return a
5
o f
2 4
1, indicating the entire pool contains a positive sample. Conversely , a 0 indicated a negative
sample, where all samples in the group were “released” from testing as they are labeled negative
and were not considered positive candidates. In a nonadaptive strategy , this was all done in one
step, where all tests were run at the same time to determine its positive candidates. In an adaptive
strategy , tests were separated in steps, where the pooling strategies in proceeding steps changed
based on the prior result. In our method, an adaptive strategy follows that if a test is negative, all
samples within that row are removed from the tests, while all the remaining positive candidates
are tested once again but under dif ferent parameters given by the remaining sample size.
To ensure that samples were equally tested amongst the simulation, disjoint pools were
adapted into both the nonadaptive and adaptive strategies. Rather than randomly pick the
samples at the start of each test, all samples were shuf fled, then divided according to pool sizes.
Given a pool size
s
, sample size
n
, and starting test
number
t =
n / s
,
this guarantees that in the
first
t
tests, every sample is tested only once and
that there is no overlap between the first
t
tests.
After all samples are run equally in the first
t
tests,
the remaining pool (whether nonadaptive or
adaptive pooling) is reshuf fled and divided once again for the following
t
tests.
In both strategies, infection rate and the number
of tests were varied to determine an
optimal condition for further analysis, while the number of samples and pooling size were kept
constant. Given a lar ge sample size
n
and rate of
infection
r,
the optimal pooling size for both
strategies was equal to
s
= 1/
r
. With this pooling
size, there is a high probability that there is at
least one negative pool
,
allowing for a lar ge portion
of the sample size to be declared negative in
a minimal number of tests.
Although this may seem to optimize our pooling size, in reality complications arise from
these high pooling sizes. Lar ge pools above 32 samples may dilute the samples where positive
COVID samples are not detectable through normal laboratory means[5]. In order for COVID to
be detectable in lar ger pool sizes, the laboratory would require longer lengths to examine, which
is even less optimal. To reflect this reality , pool sizes were limited to a maximum of 32, as
positive COVID samples were detectable at this size, but were less favorable with lar ger sizes[5].
To improve identifying negative samples, least squares regression algorithm was run,
where the pooling problem was represented by the form
where the prediction𝐴𝑥 − 𝑏||||22
x-vector that determined positive and negative tests was minimized.6

Centrality Pooling
With the infectious state of each person given by the SEIR disease model,
we record the
state of each individual at each time stage to understand the spread of the disease in the
population. At the same time, we also randomly created connections in this social network to
mimic relationships within communities: everyone has several friends, where each friend has
their own friends, and so on. This is demonstrated in Figure 2. Thus,
our testing results on this
population will be more realistic and trustworthy , giving us more information about improving
its ef ficiency in the real-world setting.
Figure 2:
8 people social network with random connections
and 2 infectious people (4 and 7)
]
When we have a network model, we think about how
to use the characteristics of the
network to improve our model. One of the ideas is to use the degree centrality data of the model
to help us create pools.
The degree of centrality
assigns each node’ s importance based on the
number of connections to that node. In other words, if this node had a significant number of
connections, this node had a high degree of centrality (Figure 3) [7].
7
o f
2 4
[Figure 3: high degree centrality node example in network]
The basic idea behind the degree centrality pooling is that we pool people based on their
degree centrality instead of pooling people randomly . The idea is to prioritize those with high
degree centrality because their chance of infection is greater , so the result of their group test is
very likely to be positive, allowing us to find many positives in the first few tests. The remaining
people are, therefore, much likely to be negative.
In conclusion, the higher degree centrality the more testing and smaller sampling sizes
are. For example, we even perform many individual tests for people with top 5% of the degree
centrality as their connections are very high in this network, suggesting their higher chance of
infection.
Machine Learning Pooling
To advance our graphing strategy , we use the extended-SEIR
infectious disease network
model and also demographic model to address community level contacts.
A simulation of
COVID-19 spread over time within the communities was performed with the demographic
network. We analyze the state of each individual at each time stage to understand the spread of
the disease in the population. Figure 4 is a sample spread of the COVID-19 in the social network
for fifty days with 15 initially infected people in a 1000 population. By simulating this spread in
8
o f
2 4
the network, our
testing results on this population are more realistic, providing more information
for testing.
[Figure 4:
COVID-19 spread in the social network
for fifty days with 15 initially infected people
in 1000 population
]
With so much information provided by these networks,
we decide to use machine
learning to assist us on testing as it would give our suggestions on whether these people are
positive or negative based on the training. Therefore, w
e first extract two features from the
disease network: degree centrality and eigenvector centrality . The eigenvector centrality , similar
to degree centrality , assigns nodes’  importance based on the eigenvector of the network
adjacency matrix. In other words, the higher the eigenvector centrality is, the more connections
to other high score nodes. We also use household size and age group from demographic
networks. The last feature we use is infected count which is the number of times an individual
appears in a positive group test. Following figure 5  is our sample training data.
9
o f
2 4
[Figure 5:
sample training data for machine learning
model
]
Our trained machine learning model will return predictive
probabilities of positive and
negative for each node. Therefore, by looking at the predictive probabilities, we can estimate
whether this person has a higher chance of being infected. We then sort predictive probabilities,
and as we did in degree centrality pooling, we prioritize people with high predictive probabilities
for positives. Thus, our trained model can help us tar get potential positive people, reducing the
number of testsings.
Tensor  Pooling
When generalizing the tensor method, each tensor
of rank r -1 was considered as a pool
within the pooling matrix. This allowed to accurately identify which samples were infected given
their unique id in
, especially during low
prevalence rates in the population. After the pooling𝑅𝑟
matrix was completed, the samples were pooled together , run through qPCR, and displayed the
output of infected pools. Each sample within an unaf fected pool was labeled as negative for the
virus while all other samples were individually tested or through another method.

RESUL TS
Non Adaptive Pooling
Using the same parameters as Two Step Adaptive Pooling (2-ST AP)[4] with a sample
size of 961 sample size, 52 tests, and 5 infected samples, our nonadaptive pooling algorithm had
an average accuracy of 97.02% for a pool size of 192.
[Figure 4: Accuracy of the algorithm with pool size 192 over 1000 simulations]
Although the accuracies were high, a pool of 192 may be too dilute to detect and may not
reflect conditions within the laboratory . Therefore, we limited the pool size to 64, and the results
yielded an accuracy of 92%. While limiting the pool size, we accounted for the dilute samples by
including a False Negative Rate of 0.1 with a pool size of 64[5].

Furthermore, running our non-adaptive pooling algorithm with 10 and 15 infected and a
pool size of 64, yielding an average accuracy of 91% and 82%, respectively .
Adaptive Pooling
We ran our first adaptive algorithm (running initial tests, ruling out negative indexes, and
pooling from the remaining indexes) with 70 max tests and 10 infected, while varying population
and the simulation showed similar accuracies to the non-adaptive pooling scheme. The adaptive
algorithm performs better at smaller population sizes, but has relatively similar accuracies with
the nonadaptive strategy as the population size increases.
[Figure 6: Adaptive vs Non Adaptive accuracy with 70 tests, 10 infected across varying
Populations]
Disjoint Pooling
Using similar parameters used in the nonadaptive simulations, the results for 5, 10, and
15 infected samples with a maximum pool size of 64 yielded an average accuracy score of 98%,
95% and 90% respectively .

Limited Adaptive Pooling
With a maximum pool size of 16, population size of 500, and 5 infected samples, we
varied the number of adaptive steps to determine an optimal amount of adaptive steps before
running the remaining tests as a nonadaptive scheme. With varied adaptive steps with a
maximum of 40 tests, the accuracy between the steps did not fluctuate significantly , where each
accuracy was similar within 1%.

When the group size is 60, in a population with 1000 people, 20 infected people, the
accuracy is around 80% for 60 tests and the accuracy still increases as group tests increase
(Figure 8).

When the testing number is 65,
in a population with 1000 people, 20 infected people, the
accuracy reaches its peak when there are about 100 people in a pool. The accuracy first increases
and then decreases when pool size increases
(Figure
8.1).
[Figure 8.1: Accuracy vs group size when number of tests is 65 ]
Machine Learning Pooling
To solve the imbalance training dataset problem,
we use a balanced random forest
classifier to train our model. It performs bagging and bootstrapping to make the dataset more
balanced and the sampling strategy is to sample only minority classes. Moreover , the class
weights are applied, meaning it punishes models more harshly if it predicts positive people
wrong.
The classifier returns probabilities for this node being positive and negative. We think
these probabilities can be used to improve our testing accuracy . In the figure 9, it is clear to see
that the dif ference of predictive probabilities for positive and negative people are significantly
different.
1 5
o f
2 4
[Figure 9: ML ’s predictive probabilities results.
Top: for positive people; Bottom: for negative people ]
However , the trained classifier does not apply to other generated networks as dif ferent
randomness is added in every other generated network. The dif ferences of its predictive
probabilities are not significant dif ferences as it did in the last network (Figure 10).
1 6
o f
2 4
[Figure 10: ML ’s predictive probabilities results for new network
Top: for positive people; Bottom: for negative people ]
To overcome this problem, we decided to use a portion of the data to train the network to
ensure the classifier applies to the testing dataset. However , it forms a dilemma: in order to do
that we need to perform a lar ge number of individual tests to get positive status for training at the
beginning. We also need to do many group testing beforehand to get enough infected count
features. These together cost a lot of testing. But if we do not do that, our classifier won’ t be
trained well and will perform poorly for the rest of the population.
Our conclusion is that we do not have enough real world data. If we do, it solves both
problems listed above: we do not have to perform many testings beforehand as trained data is
already provided; the trained classifier definitely would apply to new testing data as they all
come from real world networks.
Tensor  Pooling
We test the dif ference between tensor rank 2 and tensor rank 3 when calculating the
number of tests needed to detect all infected samples. Methods for tensor rank 2 are given by the
above followed by individual testing to detect all infected samples. Methods for tensor rank 3
will be followed by tensor rank 2 testing and then followed by individual testing to detect all
infected samples. We test each method by increasing the size of our sample, placing a 2%
prevalence rate i our population, and running our methods using these parameters. Each method
was run 100 times for each sample size and then averaged to find our mean number of tests.
1 7
o f
2 4
[Figure 10: Number of tests needed to detect all infected samples with increasing sample size
and 2% prevalence rate]
Results show that both tensor rank 2 and tensor rank 3 methods increase in the number of tests
needed to detect all infected samples as the sample size increases. This phenomenon is theorized
to occur because of the increased number of infected samples as the sample size increases.
However , both tensor rank 2 and tensor rank 3 methods perform very similarly in terms of the
number of tests needed.
[Figure 1 1: Dif ference in tensor rank 3 testing vs. tensor rank 2 testing in the number of tests
needed to detect all infected samples with increasing sample size and 2% prevalence rate]
Because the number of tests for each method was determined to be around the same, we
concluded that using the tensor rank 2 method was a more feasible choice. This was because of
1 8
o f
2 4
statements above with complications arising from these high pooling sizes. The number of
samples within each pool increases by
as n increases. Thus, for the following tests(𝑐𝑒𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔(3𝑛))2
(𝑐𝑒𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔(2𝑛))
we consider using the tensor rank 2 methods.
We then consider testing our tensor method as the number of infected samples increases.
We set the sample size to be 40, 60, and 961 respectively , mimicking Tapestry Numbers.
[Figure 12: Number of tests needed to detect all infected samples with sample size of 40 and 60
increasing infected number of samples]
Based on our results, it shows that as the number of infected samples increases, so does
the number of tests. However , as the prevalence of the virus in our population increases to
exceedingly high rates (around 25% of the samples as infected), the tensor method fails to do
better than individual testing. This can also be concluded with our results with a sample size of
60. However , a sample size of 40 and 3 infected samples only uses around 20 samples in order to
detect all samples, competing with Tapestry numbers. Additionally , a sample size of 60 and 4
infected samples only uses around 25 samples, indicating the consistency in competitiveness
with Tapestry .
1 9
o f
2 4
[Figure 13: Number of tests needed to detect all infected samples with sample size of 961 and
increasing infected number of samples]
With an increased sample size of 961, our tensor rank 2 method needs significantly lower
amounts of tests  than individual testing in order to detect all infected samples within the
population for prevalence rates less than 2%. With 9 infected samples, our tensor rank 2 method
needs around 125 tests in order to find all infected samples, competing with Tapestry numbers.
Our last test for the tensor method considers splitting the sample into two groups. The
first stage will involve running the tensor rank 2 algorithm on both groups separately and the
second stage will involve running independent tests on the remaining samples that have not been
correctly identified.

2 4
[Figure 15: Dif ference in tensor rank 2 testing vs. tensor rank 2 split testing in the number of
tests needed to detect all infected samples with increasing sample size and 10% prevalence rate]
Based on the simulations, at all sample sizes with 10% prevalence, splitting the sample
size into two groups will require fewer tests in order to accurately identify all the samples. One
explanation for this is that decreasing the number of infected samples within a group will also
decrease the amount of pools that are infected. For each sample that is infected after the first
within a given group, at least one additional pool will also be considered “infected” within it. As
many as
r
pools can be labelled as infected with the
addition of a new infected sample within a
given group (in the given case as much as 2 pools). Thus, splitting the sample into two dif ferent
groups can decrease the number of pools that will be considered infected. This split method also
has an ef fect at lower prevalence rates. With 961 samples and 1% prevalence rate, the split
method requires around 99 tests in order to find all infected samples compared to the 125 tests
needed in an ordinary rank 2 tensor method without splitting.

DISCUSSION
Non Adaptive Pooling
Both the non adaptive pooling schemes seem to underperform against the 2-ST AP
numbers, which makes sense because the 2ST AP algorithm is an adaptive pooling scheme.
Compared to Tapestry numbers, we slightly underperform, but that is a result of us limiting the
2 1
o f
2 4
max pool size to make our simulation more realistic. Still, we only see an average of 1-3%
decrease in accuracy , even though we limited the pool size to be 64 in our algorithm..
Our non adaptive methods were able to reach accuracies greater than 93% when run with
Tapestry numbers. This is very promising as we were able to decrease the amount of tests from
961(if you were running individual COVID-19 R T-qPCR), to no more than 90 tests. Also, our
methods being non adaptive makes it realistic, as we do not need to ask patients to stay until
initial test results are back.  The biggest shortcomings we see in our non adaptive pooling
algorithms is that it does not accurately model real life situations. For example, people being
infected should not be randomly picked from a uniform distribution, but rather , in real life people
are infected via networks. Also,  COVID-19 R T-qPCR tests spit out percentages rather than
binary outputs of positive or negative.
Going forward, our objective is to not necessarily improve the accuracy by making pool
sizes bigger , but it is to better model real life, by keeping pool sizes at a maximum of 64, while
not sacrificing on accuracy . We plan to model real life issues better by implementing two things
next quarter . Instead of outputting a binary output, we plan to output a percentage chance of
infection, as this is what COVID-19 R T-qPCR tests actually output. Second, we plan to change
our pooling algorithm into something that implements networks, which is described more in
detail in the degree centrality pooling section. Ideally we want our final proposal to be something
that is non-adaptive as this is most realistic for a real life trial.
Adaptive Pooling
Our first initial adaptive pooling algorithm did not do much better than the non-adaptive
pooling algorithm, so we quickly moved on and implemented a recursive pooling algorithm. The
recursive pooling algorithm, reached similar accuracies compared with the 2 ST AP algorithm
mentioned above. It reached accuracies of .99 consistently .
However , we do understand that our recursive adaptive pooling did not use realistic pool
sizes, since at this point in our project, we did not yet introduce the idea of a max pool size of 64.
Because of this, it is hard to conclude that we would see similar results if we actually tried our
recursive algorithm in real life. We understand that saliva could be diluted so much in a lar ge
pool, that makes it nearly impossible to identify the COVID-19 virus even if it is present.
Therefore, we are hopeful, but cautious. Our hope is to move from adaptive to non adaptive2 2
o f
2 4
pooling as holding people in a testing site, and making them wait until initial tests are run is not
ideal for anybody . Also adding the restriction of pool size and noise.
Limited Adaptive Pooling
Our limited adaptive pooling results compete with
2-ST AP measures, but do use quite a
large amount of adaptive cycles. This might cause problems with wait time when it is actually
implemented in real life. If wait time is not an issue, the results of our limited adaptive pooling is
actually quite promising, as we lower tests, while reaching pretty good accuracies. Looking at
our results however , we are only convinced in our results if we run at least 6 adaptive cycles.
Going forward, we want to shift more of our focus on pooling via networks, as this models the
world more accurately .
Degr ee Centrality Pooling
The result of degree centrality pooling is not very promising. In my opinion, the ideal
accuracy for 60 tests in a population of 1000 with around 30 infected people should be at least
85% accuracy , compared to the result of the random pooling algorithm we tried first. I think one
of the limitations is the SEIR model is an oversimplified model which cannot fully represent the
realistic status of the Covid-19 in real world. Also, with this simple model, we can only access a
limited amount of data. For example, we can only access network information like centrality , but
cannot gain connective or demographic information. To advance this testing model, we employ a
more sophisticated disease model which is used in machine learning testing strategy in our
project.
Machine Learning Pooling
With advanced and more complex social network models,
we have access to more
information like household sizes, age-stratification and out-of-household contacts. These
improve our testing method in various ways, for example, we are able to try to find patterns in
the population to tar get high risk people, saving us plenty of tests. However , as we explore this
strategy , we find out we cannot further advance due to the lack of real world data. With real
world data, we can confidently train the mode which definitely applies to new testing
populations as they both come from real world networks; moreover , with the real world data, we2 3
o f
2 4
no longer need to do multiple individual and group tests beforehand. However , we do think
machine learning strategy is a promising strategy as the trained model can give us predictive
probabilities whether this person is positive or negative, providing a lot of information during the
tests. Combining these tests, the testing method can specifically pool and test high risk people,
saving resources and time. Our team reckon if we have real world data, the machine learning
method or even neural network testing method should be considered to carry out.
Tensor  Pooling
Our tensor rank 2 pooling method competes with Tapestry numbers and has a possibility
of further improvement based on more research. The simplicity in the pooling method allows us
to produce results in sometimes less than 2 adaptive steps. Additionally , we find that the pool
size within our tensor method works well for decreasing the dilution of positive samples within
pools. It is not until we have 4097 samples within a tensor rank 2 method that the pool sizes will
exceed 64. However , our method also lacks flexibility as the prevalence rates increase and relies
more and more on individual testing as the number of infected samples within our sample
increases. One theory may explain this inflexibility . As the number of infected samples increases,
more rows and columns of our tensor become labeled as infected (the rows and columns indicate
pools and the results of those pools are infected if only 1 sample in the pool is infected). Because
the creation of the pooling matrix requires each sample to have a unique row and column id,
adding one more infected sample to our sample will always flip at least one of the pools from not
infected to infected. Thus, splitting the sample into two dif ferent groups before running the first
stage will help drastically improve the performance of the algorithm, especially as the number of
infected samples increases within a sample.
Future work with this method can be achieved through more research in encoding and
decoding algorithms. The similarity between this method and many encoding and decoding
algorithms gives us a starting point on what additional tweaks are needed to improve this
method. Additionally , this method can be combined with viral pools in order to accurately detect
infected samples even before individual testing is performed. Pushing this tensor method to
detect samples before individual testing can lead us towards finding a non-adaptive tensor
method that detects infected samples with high accuracy , ensuring faster detection of the
SARS-CoV -2 virus and quicker results for patients.2 4

Abstract
Machine learning tools are increasingly used for decision-making in contexts that have crucial
ramifications. However, a growing body of research has established that machine learning models
are not immune to bias, especially on protected characteristics. This had led to efforts to create
mathematical definitions of fairness that could be used to estimate whether, given a prediction task
and a certain protected attribute, an algorithm is being fair to members of all classes. But just like
how philosophical definitions of fairness can vary widely, mathematical definitions of fairness vary
as well, and fairness conditions can in fact be mutually exclusive. In addition, the choice of model
to use to optimize fairness is also a difficult decision we have little intuition for. Consequently,
our capstone project centers around an empirical analysis for studying the relationships between
machine learning models, datasets, and various fairness metrics. We produce a 3-dimensional
matrix of the performance of a certain machine learning model, for a certain definition of fairness,
for a certain given dataset. Using this matrix on a sample of 8 datasets, 7 classification models,
and 9 fairness metrics, we discover empirical relationships between model type and performance on
specific metrics, in addition to correlations between metric values across different dataset-model
pairs. We also offer a website and command-line interface for users to perform this experimentation
on their own datasets.
1 Introduction
Today, machine learning tools are becoming increasingly prevalent and are being used for decision-
making in contexts that have crucial ramifications. However, the algorithms that are used often are
suspect to many biases that may be obscure and difficult to isolate, especially within complex models,
and it is often hard to determine if they are fair or not in the intuitive sense. Due to this issue,
there have naturally been efforts to create mathematical definitions of fairness that could be used to
estimate whether, given a prediction task and a certain protected attribute, an algorithm is being fair
to members of all classes of the attribute.
However, just like how philosophical definitions of fairness can vary widely, mathematical defini-
tions of fairness are not always agreed upon. Furthermore, different definitions of fairness can often
be mutually exclusive in most real-world data, meaning that anyone trying to judge the fairness of a
model must decide the specific metric that is most relevant to their task – a decision which is not only
difficult, but also laden with the influence of values and politics.
What makes that decision even more difficult is that we know very little of how different fairness
definitions relate to different models. Previous research has shown how some machine learning models
lend themselves better than others in certain data contexts - such as neural networks being especially
appropriate for unstructured data - where there is just as much work involved in discovering features
from the data as there is in optimization. But we lack this same understanding with fairness.
Our capstone project centers around furthering research done in the area of fairness in machine
learning, and how it relates to specific data and models. We have produced a 3-dimensional matrix
displaying the performances of different combinations of models and datasets, evaluated on different
fairness metrics. Upon investigating these results, we aim to answer several potential questions about
the relationships that exist between these 3 dimensions as well as within them.
∗Supervised by Professor David Danks, Professor of Data Science & Philosophy, University of California, San Diego
1For example, we can analyze whether some models are able to perform more fairly for certain
datasets, in the same way some models are more accurate than others for certain data. We can explore
whether certain models, over the range of datasets, tend to be fairer than others using some definitions
of fairness. By looking at correlations between the results for different fairness metrics, we can also find
an empirical grouping of which fairness metrics tend to correlate with each other, and whether these
correlations align with what we might expect given the philosophical definition of fairness underlying
each metric.
Though the analysis done on our end can be insightful and potentially indicative of general
patterns, we understand that our findings are heavily based on the specific data we have chosen to
create our matrix with. Therefore, we have also created a website that allows users to input their own
preprocessed datasets and evaluate them on our chosen models and fairness metrics, so they can apply
the same kind of analysis to data more relevant to their own interests or tasks. Our code will also be
publicly available for those who may want to run the project with their own specifications.
2 Methods
In our implementation of this project, we use 8 datasets, 7 machine learning models, and 9 fairness
metrics, for a total of 504 unique metric values. The specifics are described below.
2.1 Data Acquisition
In order to use datasets that are well-suited for analysis of fairness, as well as relatively clean and well-
formatted, we chose to use previously published datasets from the machine learning fairness literature.
These datasets are usually attached or linked to the papers they come from, and are cited below in
Table 1.
2.2 Data Preparation
Before passing the data into the main pipeline for analysis, we first preprocess the dataset from the
initial form found at the data source into a standardized .csv file. This preprocessing includes one-hot
encoding of categorical columns, conversion of labels to a numerical 0/1 format, imputation of missing
values, and other common dataset preprocessing techniques. In order to encode metadata about the
dataset that cannot be included in the CSV file itself, each preprocessing script also outputs a JSON
config file with information that is manually entered such as the dataset name, the type of prediction,
and most importantly, which columns contain the features, the sensitive groups, and the labels of
interest.
2.3 Analysis Pipeline
Once the datasets have been processed, they are then passed into the main Python file for the analysis
pipeline. Fundamentally, the analysis is a 3-layer nested loop, with every combination of dataset,
model, and metric being run. Firstly, the program collects the dataset CSV file and the config JSON.
Using the information from the config file, it selects the corresponding X, y, and group columns, and
does a 75/25 train-test split to generate train and test partitions for each dataset. For each model,
the script applies the model by training it on the train partitions, and outputs predictions on the test
partitions. Finally, these predictions are passed in along with all previous data into the function for
each metric, where a real-valued output is returned as the metric value. This value is recorded in
a 3-dimensional Python dictionary, which after the full loop is complete, is converted into a Pandas
dataframe for legibility.
The models used in this project are all contained in the scikit-learn package. They are: logistic
regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-
Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes classification. In each model, we used the default hyperparameters
in scikit-learn. These models were chosen because they span a wide range of types of learning, from
regression, to tree-based learning, to a basic neural network; they were also chosen because of their
relative popularity.

Table 1: Table of Current Datasets Chosen
3The metrics used are derived both from the scikit-learn [6] and fairlearn [1] packages. The
first two metrics are overall classification metrics agnostic of protected groups: overall accuracy, and
overall Brier score, which measures calibration. The rest measure balance between classes in certain
classification metrics: false positive rate, F1 score, recall, accuracy, Brier score, demographic parity,
and equalized odds, in most cases taking the range of values over all protected group instances. (e.g.
if the protected class is sex, the false positive rate metric takes the false positive rate of a model for
men, and the rate for women, then finds the absolute difference. Therefore, 0 is ideal, and 1 is the
worst possible result.)
3 Results
3.1 Overview
Our project runs machine learning algorithms over a group of datasets, and evaluates these models’
performance on a group of metrics. We can then slice the resulting matrix in several interesting ways to
study the relationships between models and metrics, between models and datasets, and between met-
rics. Of course, metric values will vary in scale and value between different datasets due to differences
in their underlying structures. Therefore, when aggregating metric values from different datasets, we
use the rank of the model performance on the metric for that dataset. These ranks also adjust for
whether a larger or smaller number is better for the specific metric – for example, a higher overall
accuracy is better, while a lower range of accuracies between groups is ideal. Raw values for the entire
dataset are available on our GitHub repository.
3.2 Analyzing Relative Results
3.2.1 Model Performance per Metric
Figure 1: Mean rank of model across all datasets, for each metric.
4The above chart displays the mean rank of a model on a particular metric across all datasets. For
example, the logistic regression model had on average the third-best Brier score range, meaning that
the quality of calibration of the model varied between protected classes the third-least in the logistic
regression model when compared to other models.
There are certain observations we can make from the above heatmap about the relationship
between models and metrics. The Random Forest model performed the best on both overall metrics,
overall Brier score and overall accuracy, and also was the best at balancing accuracy and Brier score
between classes, as evidenced by its ranks on Brier score range and overall accuracy. Meanwhile, the
Support Vector Machine model does well across a broad spectrum of fairness metrics, indicating that
it might be a model better-suited for fairness than something like a decision tree or logistic regression,
which scored poorly across fairness metrics. We also observe that the models that tend to be the most
accurate tend to do the worst on demographic parity, which makes sense, because demographic parity
is the sole metric that does not take into account whether predictions have been made correctly.
3.2.2 Correlation Between Metrics
Figure 2: Correlation heatmap between raw metric values.
The above figure shows the correlation between (raw, unranked) metric values overall all datasets
and models. First, we notice that demographic parity is negatively correlated with all other group
fairness metrics, likely because, again, demographic parity does not take into account whether pre-
dictions have been made correctly. More interestingly, we also observe that overall accuracy is also
negatively correlated with other metrics of fairness, implying a tradeoff in the accuracy of a model
and how well it performs on fairness metrics. In general, however, we do find a positive correlation
between most fairness metrics based on comparing different subsets of results to the true labels, such
as false positive rate balance, equalized odds, and recall. We also find a very strong negative correla-
tion between accuracy and Brier score (calibration). This may seem counterintuitive as Brier score is
generally viewed as just an alternative way of measuring accuracy, but it may be because Brier score
punishes being too confident in a prediction even when correct, while accuracy incentivizes predicting
the correct class without consideration of exactly how confident it is.
5Finally, we also observe that both the overall accuracy and Brier score are basically uncorrelated
with the ranges of these metrics between groups, indicating that simply maximizing the metric perfor-
mance on the entire dataset does not necessarily mean it will improve the degree to which it is equal
for every demographic group.
3.2.3 Models and Datasets
Figure 3: Mean model rank across all metrics, for each dataset.
This figure displays the mean rank of each model (across every fairness metric) for each dataset.
While we might not be able to immediately ascertain why certain models perform better in different
types of data, we still notice that the relative performance of models are not constant between datasets,
and the best model for one dataset might not necessarily be the best model for another dataset. For
example, we see the Random Forest model performs well across a variety of datasets, which is perhaps
predictable given its reputation as a good “black-box” model that can be universally applied with little
feature engineering.
3.3 User Extensibility
3.3.1 Website
In an effort to make our research more reproducible and replicable, we took further actions to make
sure that we were transparent about our work and allow for others to use it. In addition to performing
our own analysis, we also have created ways for users to perform similar experiments on their own
data. This can be done in two ways.
The first is by going to the static website, where users may be informed about an overview of
the project that features an explanation of the models and metrics for users who might not be familiar
with them. The demo section of the page takes users to the webapp, which allows users to upload
their own CSV file, cleaned to the same specifications as described above and with the last column
6representing the target label. Users are then able to select what models they would like to run on their
data, as well as what metrics. Upon submission, the webapp runs the pythonic code and returns an
HTML table displaying the results.
Figure 4: Screenshot using an example CSV with options inputted in the webapp
Figure 5: Resulting table displayed on the webpage
3.3.2 Github Repository
Although the webapp provides a easily accessible way for a curious user who does not have coding
experience to quickly get results, due to the Python code being hosted on Flask and through Google
Cloud servers, errors may be more obscure and performance may be slow for the user, and they may
want to seek further modifications themselves. Users who want to build upon our work or have more
experience with code have an option to delve deeper by simply cloning our own GitHub repository,
where all users have to do to add datasets to our existing analysis is to place them into the cleaned
dataset folder, with the proper cleaning performed and with the JSON config file filled out correctly.
Then, users may run the main Python script at the top level of the directory to run the analysis.
Instructions for users explaining these steps are located in the README file of the repository. More
enterprising users could also add new models and metrics to our pipeline, which is also quite simple
to do.
4 Conclusion
4.1 Overview
In this project, we have developed a framework for empirically analyzing the relationships between
machine learning models and fairness metrics on a wide variety of datasets. While much more work
7needs to be done to understand the ways in which model and metric choice affect how we determine
whether an application of machine learning is fair, our broad survey of a handful of models, metrics,
and datasets has nevertheless produced some interesting insights. These include which models tend to
perform better on fairness metrics, empirical evidence of fairness-accuracy tradeoffs, and how nominally
aligned metrics can disagree, such as in the example of accuracy and calibration.
Our project also offers opportunities for users to extend our analysis with new data, and if they
are willing to edit our code, they can also add new models and metrics to our analysis. We do this
through both a user-friendly website and a GitHub repository with instructions for new analysis. This
analysis can be useful by offering a way to quickly evaluate how different machine learning models
perform with regards to fairness on new data, and for student learning machine learning, it can be
used to learn more about the models, metrics, and datasets at play. Our methods could also be used to
evaluate new models or metrics when they are developed: if a researcher develops new machine learning
metrics, they could use our analysis pipeline to determine how it correlates with existing metrics, and
which machine learning models optimize it. If a new machine learning model for classification is
developed, our pipeline could be used to determine how it stacks up against popular existing models
across a variety of fairness metrics.
4.2 Limitations
There are some aspects to our project that limit the degree to which we can generalize its results.
For example, we used default parameters when training our models for the sake of generalizing the
pipeline and decreasing computation time. This is not always the best decision in machine learning,
and some of the models might produce slightly different results if parameters were more specifically
tuned. Another limitation of our study, naturally, is the limited number of models, metrics, and
datasets we used, which could have been larger to generalize to more models and contexts of data.
4.3 Concerns
Another possible concern is whether our project might be used for the reverse-engineering of fairness.
As we’ve discussed, machine learning metrics can differ greatly, if not be mutually exclusive, and
therefore, different metrics can present a very different picture of a model’s performance. With an
increased amount of focus on fairness in recent years, it is possible that anyone developing machine
learning algorithms will want to make their models seem more fair than they actually are by cherry-
picking a metric that most aids that argument.
We understand that due to the potential for harm or misuse since our topic is based on fairness
in machine learning and there may be researchers who would like to use the tool for other purposes,
we tried to incorporate a disclaimer as a checkbox to remind users that the form is for educational
purposes only. In making this a necessary disclaimer for the user to check before the program will
run as well as making users choose what metrics they want to focus on before running the program,
we hope that these user design choices will encourage users to approach this from a more educational
point of view. While we will never be able to entirely prevent malicious uses of our project, we can at
least try to ensure that any well-meaning students or researchers do not misinterpret its results.
4.4 Further Directions for Research
The most clear extension of our project would be to continue to add models, metrics, and datasets
to the 3-D matrix, which would theoretically increase how generalizable the results would be to more
machine learning contexts. On top of this, there is a great deal of theoretical research still to be done
in machine learning fairness to grasp the relationships between fairness metrics, such as using real
analysis to study the degree to which different metrics might overlap, which could help to determine
how easy it is to perform something akin to p-hacking for fairness, as mentioned earlier. Another
direction given more time would be to delve deeper into the specific datasets that already are in the
matrix and seek to explain why a certain model works better in terms of metric performance rather
than another. This would most likely involve the nuanced differences within a specific dataset and how
the industry works, where background knowledge pertaining to the specific industry would be most
useful in gleaning explanations.
8There are also plenty of directions to expand when it comes to new types of prediction. Especially
before the last couple of years, most of the work done on machine learning fairness dealt with binary
classification tasks, which do cover a great deal of real-world examples; since the datasets and metrics
we used are drawn from previous research, we also chose to focus on binary predictions. But machine
learning is used in many other contexts, such as regression, multiclass prediction, text translation,
image classification, and much more. Therefore, there exists a need to convey our philosophical under-
standings of fairness into new metrics that can evaluate all of these more complex types of prediction,
and similar experiments to our project could be conducted using these new metrics to understand their
properties and how they relate to other metrics and models.

Introduction
In

we
aim
to
establish
causality
between
various
socioeconomic,
political,
and
sociological
variables,
with
a
fixation
on
quality
of
life,
in
roughly
166

This
report
accompanies
a

which
displays
varying
findings
with

(variables)
in
our
data,
along
with
instructions
on
how
to
utilize
the
data
pipeline,
run
the
model,
and answer questions that were not already explored.Through
this
project,
we
utilized
the
PC
algorithm
and
a
data
pipelining
process
to
create
an
easy
to
use
and
intuitive
interface
that
allows
any
curious
individual,
and
more
specifically ,
a
government
official,
to
ask
questions
about
how
various
political,
economic,
and
socioeconomic
variables
affect
each
other
and
quality
of
life
as
a
whole
within
their
country .
Three
datasets
are
cleaned
and
available
for
use
in
this
project,
however ,
our
pipeline
allows
for
new
data
to
be
easily
added
in
with
minimal
cleaning
and
organization
needed.
In
total,
our
project
includes
166
different
countries,
but
can
be
narrowed
down
or
expanded
to
the
specifications
desired
by
the
user.
Overall,
we
focused
on
three
main
variables
for
our
exemplary
analysis:
Life
Ladder ,
Social
Support,
and
Freedom
to
Make
Life
Choices
(see
Data
section
for
more
information).
The
relations
displayed
showed
that
a
high
life
ladder
in
one
country
meant
that
it
maintained
a
high
life
ladder
in
the
following
years.
Additionally ,
a
higher
perception
of
corruption
was
related
to
a
lower
Life
Ladder
score,
which
is
a
very
interesting
and
telling
result
(see
Figure
1).
In
the
second
variable,
one
of
the
results
stated
that
more
women
in
government
led
to
a
higher
score
in
feeling
of
social
support
from
the
government.
Social
support
also
influenced
other
variables,
such
as
government
changes,
gap
in
ideological
composition
of
a
new
cabinet,
and
more
(see
Figure
2)
.
Lastly ,
the
third
variable,
Freedom
to
Make
Life
Choices,
found
that
countries
with
high
levels
of
freedom
maintained
their
status
over
the
following
years,
and
those
who
did
not
were
typically
in
authoritarian
environments.
It
was
also
found
that
more
women
in
government
caused
a
higher
score
of
freedom
to
make
life
choices.
Due
to
authoritarian
governments
typically not having women in power , this casual relation makes sense.As
seen
above,
several
conclusions
can
be
drawn
and
other
assumptions
can
be
made
and
checked
through
this
algorithm
and
with
additional
research
and
data.
The
goal
is
to
open
the
conversation
between
how
these
variables,
and
other
variables
not
seen,
can
influence
the
perceptions
of
a
country
by
its
population
and
give
a
start
of
guidance
to
a
government
official
to
explore these relations in greater depth to better their own country .

to track progress of various countries. The survey and summaries are released on a yearly basis.
Included
in
the
WHR
is
the
World
Health
Organization’ s
(WHO)
life
expectancy
at

value.
This
prediction
is
concluded
based
on
a
vast
variety
of
indicators,
as
shown
on
the

The
WHO
states
that
life
expectancies
are
actually
getting
longer ,
with
an
eight
percent
increase
in
the
past
twenty
years.

Data
Background
We
combined
several
different
datasets
in
order
to
gather
enough
data
to
properly
examine
our
question
of
choice.
To
begin,
we
utilized
the
World
Happiness
Report
(WHR)
(
https://worldhappiness.report/faq/
)
which
details,
based
on
surveys,
various
factors
thatcontribute
to
a
country’ s
overall
happiness
and
wellbeing.
Below
are
some
examples
of
important variables we examine:
Life Ladder: asks the surveyor to rank their overall
life on a scale of 1 to 10
Log GDP  per Capita: the value of goods and services pr oduced by the nation’ s economy
Healthy Life Expectancy: W orld Health Or ganization’ s life expectancy at birth.
Social
Support:
National
Average
of
Binary
Response
{0,
1}
to
being
asked
if
there
are
friends or r elatives  you can r ely on if you need help.
Freedom
to
Make
Life
Choices:
Are
you
satisfied
or
dissatisfied
with
your
freedom
to
choose?
Gener osity: National  Average of have you donated money to a charity in the past month?
Perceptions
of
Corruption:
National
average
of
response
to
is
corruption
widespr ead
throughout the government or businesses?
If
you
would
like
to
read
in
more
detail
about
these
and
other
variables,
as
well
as
some
summary
statistics,
please

PDF:

.
It
is
important
to
be
transparent
about
the
validity
of
data
and
the
impact
of
our
results.
Because
the
World
Happiness
Report
is
gathered
using
surveys,
and
does
not
survey
the
entire
population,
there
is
room
for
bias
to
make
a
negative
impact
on
the
validity
of
the
data.
The
WHR
states
that,
with
confidence,
they
survey
enough
of
the
population
in
each
country
in
order
to
have
a
reasonable
estimate
of
the
national
average.
Thus,
we
believe
that
the
data
is
still
valid
enough
to
make assumptions, but should be done so with recognition of the possible bias.Our
second
dataset
comes
from
the
Comparative
Political
Data
Set
(CPDS)
which
includes
a
collection
of
political
and
institutional
data
from
1960
to
2019.
Because
the
dataset
is
fairly
large,
we
will
not
go
into
detail
about
each
variable
and
instead
encourage
you
to
visit
https://www .cpds-data.or g/images/Update2021/Codebook_CPDS_1960-2019_Update_2021.pdf
to
read
more
about
the
specific
variables
used.
In
summary ,
the
dataset
includes
detailed
information
on
party
composition,
reshuf fles,
duration,
types
of
government,
and
additional
economic,
socioeconomic,
and
demographic
variables
to
add
to
the
World
Happiness
Report
and
our examination of the connections between these variables and Life Ladder .
Lastly ,
our
project
is
built
as
a
pipeline,
ready
for
any
additional
data
to
be
added
and
utilized
by
the
algorithm.
This
means
that
as
more
reliable
and
detailed
data
is
made
publicly
available,
we
can
easily
update
our
algorithm
and
output
to
accommodate
this
new
knowledge,
and
change
the
conclusions of the report accordingly .
Data Overview
For
our
analysis,
we
had
three
main
sources
of
data
including
World
health
report,
Comparative
Political
Data
Set
or
CPDS,
and
Income
inequality
data
set.
The
World
health
report
was
our
starting
data
set
which
had
variables
such
as
GDP ,
Life
expectancy ,
Life
Ladder ,
a
measure
of
happiness,
and
more.
This
data
set
was
a
good
starting
point
because
it
had
good
measures
of
quality
of
life,
which
would
end
up
being
our
main
variables
of
interest.
These
variables
are
life
expectancy
and
life
ladder
score,
which
is
a
measure
of
happiness.
The
next
dataset
we
added
in
was
the
Comparative
Political
Data
Set,
or
CPDS.
This
data
set
includes
features
such
as
the
amount
of
right
and
left
wing
members
of
government,
government
type,
women
percentage
ingovernment,
and
more
government
related
features.
This
data
set
was
useful
to
us
to
be
able
to
use
our
analysis
to
focus
on
how
governmental
factors
impact
quality
of
life.
Our
last
data
set
that
we
included
was
an
income
inequality
data
set.
This
data
had
features
such
as
Gini
coefficient,
median
income,
and
poverty
rate
which
are
all
measures
of
inequality
and
wealth.
This dataset was useful for us to be able to identify how financial factors af fect quality of life.
Cleaning Data
The
first
step
of
cleaning
the
data
was
converting
all
values
to
be
numerical.
Next
I
got
rid
of
all
columns
that
did
not
have
quantitative
data.
I
then
added
in
code
to
change
some
common
country
name
spellings
to
the
ones
utilized
by
our
data
sets.
To
see
the
naming
conventions
for
all
countries
in
our
dataset,
you
can
refer
to
the
list
here.
My
code
uses
regular
expressions
to
detect
the
index
columns
for
country
and
year
if
it
is
included.
My
code
will
then
remove
all
entries
missing
an
index
value
since
their
data
is
not
usable.
These
cleaning
steps
will
be
repeated
for
all
data
sets
that
are
loaded
in
and
the
datasets
will
be
assigned
into
either
data
with
year
or
data
with
no
year.
All
datasets
with
year
our
then
combined
together .
This
data
will
then
be
reformatted
to
be
indexed
by
country
name
with
values
for
every
feature
for
every
year.
To
remove
all
missing
values,
if
a
country
has
no
data
for
any
feature,
then
that
country
will
be
removed
from
the
reformatted
data.
If
a
country
has
missing
values,
then
they
will
be
predicted
with
linear
regression
based
on
the
other
feature
values
for
that
country .
This
process
results
in
the
reformatted
data
having
no
missing
values.
Once
all
the
data
with
years
is
reformatted,
the
data
with
no
years
will
then
be
added
in.
Whenever
data
sets
are
merged
together ,
to
retain
all
features
with
no
missing
values,
only
countries
present
in
both
data
sets
will
be
kept
in
merged
data.
After
all
the
inputted
data
is
merged
and
reformatted,
it
will
then
be
written
to
a
csv
filename
of
the
user's
choosing
with
the
final_data
folder
in
the
src
folder .
The
outputted
data
of
this
cleaning function will be in the correct format to have the PC algorithm run properly on it.
When
adding
in
your
own
datasets
there
are
a
few
prior
cleaning
steps
that
may
have
to
be
done.
There
must
be
a
column
with
country
names
that
has
""country""
in
the
column
name.
The
country
names
also
must
follow
the
same
naming
conventions
as
other
data
that
you
are
merging
your
data
with.
If
you
wish
to
have
an
included
column
with
years,
then
""year""
must
be
in
the
column's
name.
When
combining
datasets
with
a
year
column,
the
pipeline
will
only
include
years
that
are
in
both
datasets,
so
make
sure
the
years
are
overlapping
in
their
span.

any
other
unexpected
issues
that
you

with
using
our
pipeline,

Algorithm Methods
We
will
be
using
Independence-based
causal
discovery ,
leading
us
to
use
the
popular
PC
algorithm,
created
and
named
after
Spirtes
and
Glymour ,
that
utilizes
the
idea
that
two
statistically
independent
variables
are
not
causally
linked.
We
start
with
nodes
all
connected
by
undirected
edges,
ensuring
there
are
no
set
distributions
in
place.
We
also
use
a
significance
level
of
.05.
The
lower
the
significance
value,
the
smaller
number
of
edges
there
will
be
in
the
graph.
There are three steps the PC algorithm cycles through.
Step 1:In
the
first
step,
the
PC
algorithm
identifies
the
skeleton
by
starting
with
a
complete
undirected
graph.
It
removes
the
edge
X-Y
were
X
|_|
Y
|
Z
for
some
Z.
In
other
words,
edge
X
-
Y
is
deleted if the corresponding variables X and Y are independent.
Step 2:
After step 1, all left connected edges go through conditional independence testing. If there is no
dependence, the variable is a separation set. This continues until there are no tests left to run.
Step 3:
Now for any paths X-Z-Y  in our working graph from the previous step, where
1.
There is no edge between X and Y as determined by Step 1
2.
Z
was
not
in
the
conditioning
set
that
makes
the
variables
X
and
Y
conditionally
independent.
3.
If these are true, then we know X-Z-Y  forms an immortality
Any
edge
Z-Y
part
of
a
partially
directed
path
of
the
form
X→
Z
-
Y
where
there
is
no
edge
connecting X and Y can be oriented as Z -> Y.
Once
these
steps
have
been
cycled
through
and
completed,
and
there
are
no
more
checks
to
run,
the
graph
with
directed
edges
is
complete
and
we
can
start
inferring
information
from
that
graph
and
associated
variables,
and
in
this
case,
causal
dependencies
have
been
oscillation
patterns.
It
is
important
to
note
that
a
downside
of
conditional
independence
testing
is
that
it
is
only
efficient
with infinite data.5.
Conclusions
To
facilitate
better
understanding
of
our
results,
we
decided
to
designate
certain
variables
that
we
wanted
to
analyze
as
“variables
of
interest,”
these
were
the
following:
Life
Ladder ,
Social
Support and Freedom to Make Life Choices.
Our
logic
was
that
these
three
variables
would
allow
us
to
explore
how
certain
governmental
policy
and
leadership
could
influence
how
long
people
live,
as
well
as
how
people’ s
individual
choices could impact other variables as well.
We found the following relationships:
Figure 1: Life Ladder
For
the
first
variable,
Life
Ladder
(see
Figure
1),
the
biggest
connection
that
we
witnessed
was
with
itself,
meaning
there
was
a
causal
relationship
between
countries
with
a
high
life
ladder
and
maintaining
a
high
life
ladder
in
the
future.
The
next
variable
that
influenced
Life
Ladder
was
Perceptions
of
Corruption.
Since
the
algorithm
itself
doesn’ t
specify
whether
the
causality
is
positive
or
negative,
we
plotted
Life
Ladder
against
Perceptions
of
Corruption
to
see
the
nature
of
the
relationship
and
found
that
a
higher
Perception
of
Corruption
was
distinctly
related
to
a
lower
Life
Ladder .
In
other
words,
the
more
corruption
in
a
country ,
the
lower
quality
of
life
and
in that country .
Life
Ladder
was
also
causally
related
towards
two
other
variables.
The
first
of
these
variables
was
Generosity .
This
meant
that
a
higher
quality
of
life
caused
people
to
be
more
generous
towards
others.
Life
Ladder
also
was
causally
related
with
the
Gini
Coef ficient,
which
meant
having
a
higher
quality
of
life
was
causally
related
with
Gini
Coef ficient.
We
also
plotted
Gini
Coef ficient
against
Life
Ladder
to
see
the
nature
of
the
relationship
and
saw
that
the
higher
the
Life
Ladder
score,
the
lower
the
Gini
Coef ficient.
This
meant
that
a
higher
quality
of
life
caused
lower economic inequality .
Figure 2: Social Support
Our
second
variable
of
interest
was
Social
Support
(see
Figure
2).
We
found
that
it
was
causally
influenced
by
four
variables
other
than
itself
(Countries
with
higher
Social
Support
typically
maintained
a
high
Social
Support
year
after
year).
The
first
variable
was
Women
in
Government.
This
makes
sense
considering
that
countries
with
a
larger
percentage
of
women
in
government
probably
have
more
educational
opportunities
for
women
and
are
more
sociologically
advanced.
The
second
and
third
variables
were
changes
in
the
government
and
a
new
majority
power
in
government.
This
essentially
signaled
that
changing
government
and
having
new
people
in
power
leads
to
more
Social
Support.
This
makes
sense,
because
people
typically
campaign
on
promises
to
help
people
and
engage
voters
to
vote
for
them
for
these
reasons.
Finally ,
Freedom
to
Make
Life
Choices
was
causally
related
with
Social
Support
as
well,
meaning
that
if
people
have
more freedom in a country , it generally leads them to be more supportive of others.
Additionally ,
Social
Support
causally
influenced
several
variables.
The
first
of
these
was
a
disparity
in
government
power .
This
means
that
higher
Social
Support
caused
the
power
dynamic
in
government
to
be
more
in
favor
of
one
party .
This
is
likely
due
to
the
fact
that
countries
with
a
higher
level
of
social
support
are
more
likely
to
be
happy
with
those
who
are
in
power
in
government.
The
second
variable
was
a
gap
in
the
ideological
composition
of
the
new
cabinet,
which is similar to what was discussed in the paragraph prior .Figure 3: Freedom to Make Life Choices
Our
third
variable
of
interest
was
Freedom
to
Make
Life
Choices
(see
Figure
3).
We
found
that
it
was
highly
causally
related
with
itself,
meaning
that
countries
that
had
higher
freedoms
were
likely
to
maintain
freedoms,
while
those
who
did
not
typically
stayed
in
a
more
authoritarian
environment.
The
one
variable
we
were
able
to
find
that
causally
influenced
freedom
was
having
more
women
in
government.
On
the
surface,
this
definitely
makes
sense,
as
typically
more
authoritarian
governments
don’t
have
women
in
power ,
and
most
if
not
all
dictators
throughout
history have been men.
Freedom
to
Make
Life
Choices
also
causally
influenced
three
other
variables.
Which
were
Social
Support,
Generosity
and
the
number
of
annual
changes
in
the
government
(i.e.
number
of
elections).
This
meant
that
when
people
were
given
more
freedom
over
their
own
life
choices,
they
typically
chose
to
be
more
generous
and
much
more
supportive
of
the
people
around
them.
It
also
led
them
to
want
to
vote
more
often
so
that
they
could
hold
elected
officials
more
accountable.
Putting
everything
together ,
it
is
apparent
that
certain
pathways
exist
that
can
inform
us
how
different
societal
measures
impact
our
variables
of
interest.
For
instance,
we
can
see
that
Corrupt
governments
will
lead
to
a
much
lower
quality
of
life,
whereas
giving
people
more
power
over
their
own
choices
will
lead
to
higher
levels
of
social
support
and
generosity ,
which
indirectly
leads to a better Life Ladder (quality of life) score.
Thus,
from
our
results,
we
can
deduce
that
the
best
way
to
set
up
a
society
for
a
high
quality
of
life
is
to
have
a
transparent
government
with
frequent
elections
and
for
the
government
to
include
a
representative
body
of
people.
This
will
generally
lead
to
people
voting
for
their
own
self-interest,
which
will
lead
to
a
number
of
positive
outcomes,
such
as
higher
quality
of
life,
more generosity among individuals, more social support, and lower economic inequality .

I. ABSTRACT
The
increase
of
artificial
light
exposure
through
the
increased
prevalence
of
technology
has
an
effect
on
the
sleep
cycle
and
circadian

of
humans.
The
goal
of
this
project
is
to
determine
how
different
colors
and
intensities
of
light
exposure
prior
to
sleep
affect
the
quality
of
sleep
through
the
classification of time series data.
II. INTRODUCTION
A. Background Information
As
the
world
undergoes
technological
advancement
on
an
unprecedented
scale,
artificial
light
from
man-made
sources
is
becoming
ever
more
prevalent.
The
extent
of
this
anthropogenic
increase
in
artificial
light
has
become
a
pollutant,
with
extensive
research
showing
both
ecological
and
medical
consequences
[1].
This
is
due
to
the
importance
of
light
from
the
sun
on
the
survival
and
function
of
the
majority
of
organisms
and
thus
ecosystems
on
earth.
These
organisms
have
developed
day/night
cycles
that
cause
physiological,
behavioral,
and
metabolic
changes
which
optimize
function
and
are
essential
for
survival.
Artificial
light
interferes
with
these
processes
due
to
differences
in
wavelength,
intensity,
and
timing
from
that
of
light
with
origins
from
the
sun.
A
study
of
satellite
images
done
in
2001,
showed
that
artificial
light
at
night
(ALAN) affects 18.7% of global land area
1
, through
1
The actual percentage of global land area affected
by artificial
light is actually smaller due to this data being taken from satellite 
images and the measure of skyglow.
which
roughly
two-thirds
of
the
human
population
and
99%
of
humans
living
in
the
United
States
and
the
European
Union,
“live
in
areas
where
the
night
sky
is
above
the
threshold
set
for
polluted
status.”
[2]
The
rapid
development
of
technology
and
thus
a
rapid
increase
in
artificial
light
within
the
last
two
hundred
years
has
undoubtedly
had
effects
on
the
biological function of organisms around the world.
What
is
most
concerning
for
the
health
of
humans,
however,
is
the
ever-increasing
use
of
devices
with
light-up
displays
such
as
phones,
TVs,
and
computers
for
entertainment,
work,
and
communication.
Currently,
there
are
an
estimated
16
billion
mobile
devices
worldwide
[3]
with
many
individuals
spending
over
five
hours
a
day
looking
at
a
screen.
One
biological
mechanism
that
is
affected
by
this
increased
exposure
to
artificial
light
in
human
beings
is
the
circadian
rhythm,
through
which
the
body
undergoes
changes
during
the
night
in
preparation
for
sleep
and
changes
during
the
day
in
preparation
for
activity.
The
circadian
rhythm
plays
major
roles
in
many
“physiological
processes,
such
as
body
temperature,
blood
pressure,
hormone
secretion,
gene
expression,
and
immune
functions”
[4],
which
all
have
some
reliance
on
diurnal
light
patterns
from
the
sun
and
thus
the
optimized
function
of
these
human
body
processes
are
impacted
by
stimulus
from
artificial
sources
of
light.
When
light
enters
the
eyes
and
is
picked
up
by
photosensitive
ganglion
cells,
this
information
is
then
communicated
to
the
suprachiasmatic
nuclei
of
the
hypothalamus,
and
then
to
other
parts
of
the
brain
and
body
(
fig
1.
).
One
result
is
that
the
brain
experiences
an
increase
inwakefulness
2
and
reduction
in
homeostatic
sleep
pressure
in
the
presence
of
light
[5]
through
the
suppression
of
melatonin,
a
hormone
released
by
the
pineal
gland
which
facilitates
sleep
and
the
circadian
rhythm.
As
a
result
light
exposure
during
unnatural
times
can
detrimentally
affect
sleep,
which
is
necessary
for
human
health
and
function.
Sleep
deprivation
or
impairment
can
lead
to
many
health
issues
such
as
impairment
to
cognition
[6],
metabolism
[7],
and
immune
response
[8].
This
leads
to
the
focus
of
this
project,
which
is
to
determine
the
effects of light exposure on sleep quality.

B. Data
The
data
used
in
this
project
comes
from
the
Sueño
Ancillary
study
done
by
The
Hispanic
Community
Health
Study
/
Study
of
Latinos
(HCHS/SOL).
The
data
is
composed
of
wrist-worn
actimetry
sensor
3
data
taken
over
the
course
of
one
week
for
each
participant
(
n
=2252).
Measurements
are
taken
from
the
sensor
in
thirty-second
intervals
and
consist
of
blue,
green,
red,
and
white
light
intensities,
locomotor
activity,
time,
and
sleep
interval
indicators
[9].
One
notable
feature
that
we
use
is
the
interval
indicator,
which
describes
whether
the
patient
is
asleep,
awake
or
resting
for
a
given
epoch.
This
uses
the
study’s
sleep/wake
detection
algorithm to determine.

Wakefulness here is defined as improved auditory
reaction time,
improved ECG readings indicating alertness, and reduced 
attentional lapses.
III. METHODS
A. Feature Engineering
The
outcome
variable
that
we
used
for
the
data
is
sleep
efficiency
which
is
defined
by
the
ratio
between
the
duration
of
time
the
participant
spent
sleeping
over
the
duration
of
time
spent
in
bed
for
a
given night [10].
The sleep efficiency equation is shown
below:
𝑆𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝𝐸𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 = 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑆𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 𝑖𝑛 𝐵𝑒𝑑
To
calculate
this
quantity,
we
isolated
the
epochs
when
a
subject
switches
from
one
activity
to
another.
Thus,
the
amount
of
sleep
can
be
calculated
by
finding
the
difference
between
the
epochs
when
a
subject
sleeps
and
when
they
get
up
from
the
bed.
Similarly,
the
amount
of
time
spent
in
the
bed
can
be
calculated
by
finding
the
difference
between
the
epochs
when
a
subject
comes
to
bed
and
when
they
get
up
from
the
bed.
For
a
given
sleep
event
x
i
,
sleep
quality is defined as:
{
Good, if
SleepEfficiency(x
i
)
> 0.95
Bad, if
SleepEfficiency(x
i
)
5≤0.9
}
We
created
our
classifier
using
the
sktime
library.
The
classifiers
in
this
library
take
nested
series
as
feature
inputs
for
univariate
classification,
and
nested
series
within
DataFrames
as
feature
input
for
multivariate
classification.
These
nested
series
are
indexed
and
represent
the
value
of
the
observation
that
is
changing
with
time,
which
in
our
case
is
the
light
intensity
for
white,
blue,
green,
and
red
colors.
The
target
is
simply
a
series
of
labels
of
the
corresponding
feature
inputs.
These
labels
are
the
sleep
quality
of
a
sleep
event.
In
order
to
get
the
light
exposure
time
series
corresponding
to
a
certain
sleep
event,
we
isolated
the
light
exposure
until
2
hours
before
a
subject
went
to
sleep.
The
series
for
any
color
of
light
for
different
sleep
events
were
then
placed
within
another
series,
thus
creating
a
nested
series.
This
creates
a
feature
input
and
target
feature
that
can
be
used
for
multivariate
time
series
classification
using
the
sktime
library.
Below
is
an
example
of
how
a
DataFrame
in
this
format
would
be
structured:

The
DataFrame
is
a
matrix
where
n
is𝑛 𝑥 6
the
number
of
complete
active-rest
intervals.
Each
element
L
is
a
series
of
length
(equivalent
to
2240
hours
worth
of
30-second
epochs)
where
the
superscript
represents
the
associated
color
of
light.
SE
and
SQ
represent
the
sleep
efficiency
ratio
and
sleep
quality
rating
respectively.
The
value
of
SQ
for
any
given
SE
is
dependent
on
the
threshold,
which
we
chose
to
be
0.95
because
this
value
represents
a
sleeping
event
where
a
person
spent
about
8
hours
in
the
bed
but
did
not
sleep
until
about
25
minutes
passed
by.
This
choice
is
completely
discretionary
-
other
studies
have
used
a
value
of
0.85
[13]
based
on
their discretion.
B. ROCKET [11]
Usually
time
series
classification
models
are
highly
complex
and
require
long
training
times
even
for
small
quantities
of
data.
Some
methods
focus
on
properties
such
as
frequency
or
shape,
while
others
use
learned
convolutional
kernels
to
perform
classification.
However,
these
methods
are
not
scalable at all.
R
and
O
m
C
onvolutional
K E
rnel
T
ransform
(ROCKET)
involves
creating
features
from
time
series
using
random
convolutional
kernels.
These
kernels
have
random
length,
weights,
biases,
dilation
and
padding.
Due
to
the
randomness
in
the
kernels
and
the
resulting
features,
it
is
virtually
impossible
to
interpret
these
features.
In
fact,
interpretability
remains
a
huge
challenge
in
the
realm
of
time
series
classification.
The
number
of
kernels
is
usually
10,000
but
the
transformations
still
take
place
extremely
fast.
For
k
kernels
and
n
time
series,
where
each
time
series
is
of
length
l,
the
complexity
of
ROCKET is
O(k . n . l).
C. Classifiers with ROCKET
Once
the
random
convolutional
features
are
created,
they
can
be
used
to
train
a
linear
classifier.
In
theory,
ROCKET
can
be
used
with
any
classifier
such
as Logistic Regression or Ridge Regression.
Logistic
Regression:
ROCKET
can
be
used
with
logistic
regression
and
stochastic
gradient
descent.
This
is
particularly
suitable
for
very
large
datasets
because
it
provides
for
fast
training
with
a
memory
cost
fixed
by
the
size
of
each
minibatch.
The
complexity
of
stochastic
gradient
descent
is
proportional
to
the
number
of
features
and
the
number
of
classes
(which
is
2
in
our
case)
but
is
linear in relation to the number of training examples.
Ridge
Regression:
For
our
practical
use
case,
however,
we
use
a
ridge
regression
classifier.
The
ridge
regression
classifier
is
significantly
faster
than
logistic
regression
on
smaller
datasets
because
it
can
make
use
of
so-called
generalized
cross-validation
to
determine
appropriate
regularization.
Regularization
is
critically
important
where
the
number
of
features
is
significantly
greater
than
the
number
of
training
examples,
allowing
for
the
optimization
of
linear
models,
and
preventing
pathological
behavior
in
iterative
optimization,
e.g.,
for
logistic
regression.
The
ridge
regression
classifier
can
exploit
generalized
cross-validation
to
determine
an
appropriate
regularization
parameter
quickly.
In
the
case
of
our
model,
the
number
of
features
is
in
the
order
of
ten
thousand
while
the
number
of
training
examples
is
in
the
order
of
thousands,
so
ridge
regression
is
computationally
efficient
while
maintaining
high
accuracy.
The
non-scalability
of
ridge
classification
to larger datasets did not pose a problem for us.
D. Evaluation metric for ROCKET-Ridge Classifier
After
performing
feature
engineering,
it
turned
out
that
only
about
13%
of
sleep
events
were
of
‘Bad’
sleep
quality.
In
the
case
of
such
imbalanced
data
labels,
the
usual
accuracy
metric
would
not
be
appropriate
because
a
naive
model
that
always
predicts
‘Good’
sleep
quality
would
have
87%
accuracy,
but
it
would
be
practically
useless.
Therefore,
recall
with
respect
to
‘Bad’
sleep
quality
is
a
better
evaluation
metric.
Recall
with
respect
to
‘Bad’
sleep
quality
is
the
ratio
between
the
number
of
correctly
identified
‘Bad’
sleep
quality
events
and
a
total
number
of
actual
‘Bad’
sleep
quality
events.
When
this
ratio
is
high,
it
means
that
the
model
isable
to
correctly
predict
more
of
the
‘Bad’
sleep
quality events.
E. LSTM
Considering
our
data
is
time
series
with
the
frequency
of
1
observation
per
30
seconds
and
we
are
trying
to
predict
the
sleep-awake
status
of
an
individual
based
on
the
series
of
light
he/she
received.
A
recurrent
neural
network
(RNN)
might
be
ideal
to
accomplish
this
goal
as
RNN
will
learn
the
relationship
from
time
step
to
time
step.
It
will
produce
predictions
not
only
from
the
current
light
intensity
but
also
from
the
previous
light
the
individual received.
Long
Short-Term
Memory(LSTM)[12]
is
an
RNN
model
that
fixed
the
problem
of
losing
the
long-term
dependency
of
traditional
RNN
models.
We
are
using
the
many-to-many
architecture
where
x
<t>
is
the
light
intensity
and
y
<t>
be
the
prediction
of
the
sleep-awake
status of t
th
time step.
F. Evaluation metric for LSTM
In
the
model,
we
are
directly
predicting
the
sleep-awake
status
of
every
time
step
and
compute
the
sleep
quality
from
the
predictions.
As
we
are
not
directly
predicting
sleep
quality,
we
are
not
too
concerned
about
the
imbalanced
label
of
sleep
quality.
The
main
metric
to
evaluate
the
LSTM
model
is
still
the
accuracy
of
the
individual
prediction
in
each
time
step.
But
we
will
also
evaluate
the
accuracy
of the calculated sleep quality and recall.
IV. RESULTS
A.Training the  LSTM
Unlike
the
ROCKET
model,
we
trained
the
LSTM
model
with
raw
unbalanced
data,
because
the
sequence
of
data
passed
into
the
model
is
important
for
the
model
to
learn
the
correlation
between
each
time
step.
As
the
dimensionality
of
the
model
is
high
and
they
are
inter-correlated,
we
don’t
want
our
oversampling
on
the
bad
sleep
quality
data
to
generate unnecessary noise to the model.
We
used
the
first
1600
records
of
patients
for
the
training
set
and
the
remaining
part
of
the
dataset
as
a
test
set.
We
used
the
80-20
train-validation
split
on
the
training
set
and
trained
the
model
for
10
epochs.
We
saved
the
model
with
the
lowest
validation
loss
to
avoid
overfitting
the
model and generate the test result from it.
B. LSTM results
After
training
the
LSTM
model
and
getting
the
best
model
from
the
validation
set,
we
tested
it
against
the
test
set.
It
turns
out
that
our
model
performs
pretty
well.
The
accuracy
for
the
prediction
of
sleep-wake
states
in
each
time
step
is
92.94%
and
the
accuracy
is
98.26%
for
classifying
the
good
or
bad
sleep
quality
calculated
from
the
predicted
sleep-wake
states.
The
accuracy
is
high,
but
it
doesn’t
mean
this
is
a
perfect
model.
The
True
negative
rate
of
this
model
is
0.
This
means
that
given
light
intensity
received
by
a
patient
with
bad
sleep
quality,
the
model
never
predicts
the
patient
is
having
bad
sleep
quality.
This
may
be
caused
by
the
imbalanced
data
input
to
the
LSTM
for
training,
as
we
are
concerned
with
the
high
dimensionality
of
inter-correlation
between
time
steps
so
we
didn’t
oversample the bad sleep quality data.
However,
though
this
LSTM
model
is
not
suitable
for
sleep
quality
classification,
it
is
capable
of
sleep
state
classification
based
on
light
intensity
as
it has a cross-entropy loss of 0.82, which is very high.
C. ROCKET-Ridge Models
All
the
attempted
models
in
this
section
are
similar
in
the
sense
that
they
apply
ROCKET
on
the
light
exposure
time
series
upto
two
hours
before
any
sleep
event
to
create
features
and
then
use
Ridge
Classifier
on
those
features
to
predict
the
sleep
quality
of
any
sleep
event.
Given
that
the
data
is
imbalanced,
we
chose
to
filter
the
data
such
that
there
was
a
50/50
ratio
between
‘Good’
and
‘Bad’
quality
sleep
events
in
the
training
dataset.
The
ROCKET-Ridge
classifiers
do
not
need
any
hyperparameter
tuning
because
ROCKET
creates
tens
of
thousands
of
random
features
and
these
features
are
easily
learned
by
the
Ridge
classifier
without
overfitting
due
to
effective
regularization.
Therefore,
we
split
the
data
into
a
75/25
training-test
split with no validation set.
I.  All Lights Model: Baseline
The first baseline model included light
exposure time series for all four colors: red, blue,
green, and white.
‘Bad’ Sleep Quality Recall: 0.64
‘Good’ Sleep Quality Recall: 0.58
II. Red Light Model
This model only included light exposure
time series for the red color.
‘Bad’ Sleep Quality Recall: 0.63
‘Good’ Sleep Quality Recall: 0.60
III. Green Light Model
This model only included light exposure
time series for the green color.
‘Bad’ Sleep Quality Recall: 0.64
‘Good’ Sleep Quality Recall: 0.60
IV. Blue Light Model
This model only included light exposure
time series for the blue color.
‘Bad’ Sleep Quality Recall: 0.59
‘Good’ Sleep Quality Recall: 0.58
V. White Light Model
This model only included light exposure
time series for the white color. This model performs
the best when it comes to models with only a single
light color.
‘Bad’ Sleep Quality Recall: 0.62
‘Good’ Sleep Quality Recall: 0.61
VI. Vote Model: Best
This
model
uses
Red,
Blue,
Green
and
White
Light
Models
individually
to
get
their
predictions.
Then,
for
any
sleep
event,
the
predictions
from
the
four
models
are
put
to
vote
and
the
most
common
outcome
is
selected
as
the
final
prediction.
In
case
of
ties,
the
prediction
of
White
Light
Model
determines
the
outcome
because
it
is
the
best
performing
model
with
only
a
single
color.
This
model turns out to be the best performing model.
‘Bad’ Sleep Quality Recall: 0.63
‘Good’ Sleep Quality Recall: 0.62
D. Observations from ROCKET-Ridge Models
I. Vote Model performance difference based on
activity level
To
assess
the
model
performance
on
different
subsets
of
dataset,
we
first
split
it
into
two
groups:
first
group
included
participants
whose
mean
activity
over
the
week
of
recording
was
less
than
the
overall
median
of
mean
activity
levels
of
all
the
participants
(less
active),
and
the
second
group
included the rest of the participants (more active).
‘Bad’ Sleep Quality Recall (less active): 0.61
‘Good’ Sleep Quality Recall (less active): 0.62
‘Bad’ Sleep Quality Recall (more active): 0.65
‘Good’ Sleep Quality Recall (more active): 0.62
So,
the
Vote
Model
performs
similarly
for
‘Good’
sleep
quality
events,
both
overall
and
across
groups.
However,
the
model
performs
better
for
‘Bad’
sleep
quality
detection
for
more
active
participants
in
comparison
to
less
active
participants.
This
gives
us
an
intuition
that
among
less
active
participants,
the
light
wave
features
are
not
good
enough
at
predicting
‘Bad’
sleep
quality,
as
compared
to
that
in
more
active
participants.
This
means
that
there
must
be
other
confounding
features
among
less
active
participants
that
are
causing
‘Bad’
sleep
quality.
These
confounding
features
among
less
active
individuals
could
be
age,
health
conditions
or
events
happening
outside
the
two-hour
window
before
sleeping
that
are
dictating
the
‘Bad’
sleep
quality
among less active participants.
II. Vote Model performance difference based on sleep
level
Next,
we
split
our
dataset
into
two
groups
based
on
the
amount
of
time
that
participants
spent
sleeping:
first
group
included
participants
whose
total
sleep
duration
over
the
week
of
recording
was
less
than
the
overall
median
of
sleep
duration
of
all
the
participants
(less
sleep),
and
the
second
group
included the rest of the individuals (more sleep).
‘Bad’ Sleep Quality Recall (less sleep): 0.65
‘Good’ Sleep Quality Recall (less sleep): 0.66‘Bad’ Sleep Quality Recall (more sleep): 0.61
‘Good’ Sleep Quality Recall (more sleep): 0.58
So,
the
Vote
Model
performs
better
for
participants
that
sleep
less
and
worse
for
participants
that
sleep
more,
irrespective
of
the
kind
of
sleep
quality.
This
gives
us
an
intuition
that
among
participants
who
sleep
more,
the
light
wave
features
are
not
good
enough
at
predicting
their
sleep
quality
to
be
‘Good’
or
‘Bad’,
as
compared
to
participants
who
sleep
less.
So
there
must
be
other
confounding
features
that
are
dictating
this
classification
among
participants
who
sleep
more.
Again,
these
confounding
features
among
individuals
that
sleep
more
could
be
age,
health
conditions
or
events
happening
outside
the
two-hour
window
before
sleeping
that
are
dictating
the
sleep
quality
classification
among
participants
that
sleep
more.
III. Correlation between different colors of light
exposure levels and its consequences
We
know
that
for
any
average
individual,
the
light
exposure
at
any
instant
is
a
mixture
of
different
colors.
In
fact,
any
color
can
be
decomposed
into
its
red,
blue
and
green
components.
White
light
is
a
mixture
of
all
three
colors
at
their
maximum
intensity
and
typical
sources
include
sunlight
and
usual
artificial
lighting
indoors.
So,
as
per
our
expectations,
the
correlation
value
between
light
exposure
levels
between
any
pair
of
colors
in
the
two-hour
window
before
a
sleep
event
is
very
high.
The
least
median
correlation
occurs
between
red
and
blue
light
(=
0.73)
and
the
highest
median
correlation
occurs between green and blue light (= 0.94).
We
know
that
ROCKET
creates
random
convolutional
features
from
the
time
series
and
those
features
are
then
used
by
the
Ridge
Classifier
for
time
series
classification.
Since
the
time
series
for
different
colors
have
high
correlation,
we
would
expect
that
ROCKET
would
create
similar
wave
features
across
different
light
time
series.
Since
similar
features
are
being
used,
the
recall
for
any
sleep
quality
by
Red,
Blue
and
Green
Light
Model
should
be
the
same;
and
if
that
is
not
the
case,
it
must
be due to the difference in the color of the light.
To
determine
the
difference
in
model
performance
between
the
Red,
Green
and
Blue
Light
Model
on
‘Bad’
sleep
quality
events,
we
perform
bootstrapping
on
the
test
set
and
get
a
distribution
of
recall
values
with
respect
to
‘Bad’
sleep
quality
events
for
each
of
the
three
models.
Then,
we
use
the
Kolmogrov-Smirnov
statistic
(KS-statistic)
to
determine
whether
the
three
distributions
of
recall
values
are
the
same
or
not.
The
mean
recall
values
with respect to ‘Bad’ sleep quality are as follows:
Red Light Model: 0.63
Green Light Model: 0.64
Blue Light Model: 0.59
With a significance level of 1%, we find out
that:
a) The recall values for Red and Green Light Models
come from the same distribution (p-value = 0.91)
b) The recall values for Red and Blue Light Models
come from different distributions (p-value = 0.002)
c) The recall values for Green and Blue Light Models
come from different distributions (p-value = 0.6x10
-4
)
Thus,
the
recall
with
respect
to
‘Bad’
sleep
quality
for
the
Blue
Light
Model
is
clearly
less
than
that
of
the
other
two
models.
The
three
models
are
the
same
in
every
aspect
except
the
color
of
the
light,
which
is
not
a
feature
in
our
ROCKET-Ridge
Models.
This
gives
us
an
intuition
that
the
same
wave
features
that
work
well
in
Red
and
Green
Light
Models
do
not
work
well
enough
in
Blue
Light
Model
to
determine
‘Bad’
sleep
quality.
So,
it
must
be
that
the
reason
why
random
convolutional
features
in
the
Blue
Light
Model
aren’t
enough
to
determine
‘Bad’
sleep
quality
events
is
because
the
color
blue
itself
causes
‘Bad’
sleep
quality
to
some
extent,
and
our
model
is
unable
to
capture
that
because
color
is
not
a
feature.
This
is
in
line
with
the
popular
theory
that
blue
light
negatively
affects
sleep
quality
because
it
suppresses
the
secretion
of
melatonin
-
the
sleep-causing
hormone.
V. CONCLUSION
Due
to
the
nature
of
our
data,
it
was
necessary
to
score
our
models
based
on
recall
rather
than
accuracy
due
to
imbalances
in
the
amount
of
“good” and “bad” classified sleep events.Our
first
model
is
LSTM,
which
is
a
recurrent
neural
network
(RNN)
which
fixed
the
long
term
dependency
lost
problem
of
traditional
RNN.
We
trained
the
model
by
passing
the
light
intensity
with
30-second
epochs
and
try
to
predict
whether
the
patient
is
asleep,
awake
or
in
bed
but
not
asleep.
With
the
predicted
sleep-wake
status,
we
can
calculate
the
sleep
efficiency
and
classify
whether
the
sleep
quality
is
good
or
bad.
The
prediction
accuracy
of
the
sleep-wake
status
is
92%
and
thus
the
classification
accuracy
is
98%.
However,
the
high
accuracy
results
from
the
highly
skewed
data.
Most
of
the
sleep
in
the
data
is
of
good
quality.
With
the
Recall
with
respect
to
bad-quality
sleep
to
be
0,
this
is
not
a
good
model
for
our
prediction
task,
as
we
value
more
of
the
ability to correctly identify the bad quality sleep.
For
the
ROCKET
model
using
a
ridge
regression
classifier,
we
found
that
all
of
our
models
that
involved
using
single
light
colors
performed
similarly,
which
is
something
we
expected
due
to
our
exploratory
data
analysis
showing
that
the
readings
between
the
different
colors
all
displayed
similar
patterns.
The
best
performing
model
however
was
the
best
vote
model,
which
selected
colors
based
on
the
most
common
outcome
and
then
used
that
color
for
the
prediction.
An
interesting
discovery
that
seems
intuitively
accurate
is
that
when
bootstrapping
for
differences
in
patients
with
low
and
high
activity,
our
model
found
greater
performance
difficulty
in
low
activity
patients.
This
would
support
the
idea
that
in
patients
with
overall
lower
physical
activity,
there
is
more
influence
from
confounding
variables
on
their
quality
of
sleep;
one
possibility
is
that
lower
activity
is
an
indication
of
poorer
health.
A
similar
observation
was
found
when
differentiating
patients
who
slept
very
little
and
a
lot,
with
greater
performance
difficulty
on
patients
who
slept
a
lot.
We
can
only
speculate
that
there
are
omitted
variables
at
play
here.
Lastly,
when
bootstrapping
to
differentiate
colors,
we
again
found
that
one
of
the
colors,
blue,
had
worse
performance
and
we
speculate
that
is
due
to
blue
light
playing
a
greater
role
in
the
suppression
of melatonin.

Abstract
Sleep can be classified into four stages: N1, N2, N3, and REM sleep. While sleep stage
classification models do exist, they often do not generalize well to patients with sleep apnea. The
goal of our project is to build a sleep stage classifier specifically for people with sleep apnea and
understand how it dif fers from the normal sleep stage. We then explore whether or not the
inclusion and featurization of ECG data will improve the performance of our model. Without
ECG signals, our model achieves an accuracy rate of 87.14% in the validation set; and
surprisingly , our model’ s accuracy rate decreases to 82.08% in the validation set.
Introduction
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the more common form of sleep apnea, is a sleeping
disorder in which breathing stops and starts intermittently . This is caused when muscles in the
throat get relaxed, narrowing the airway and hampering the breathing for 10 seconds or longer .
This causes blood oxygen concentration to decrease and a buildup of carbon dioxide. Such
sudden drops in oxygen levels cause sudden increases in heart rate and blood pressure, resulting
in repeated, transient strains on the cardiovascular system. OSA  increases the risk of stroke, and
the risk of irregular heart rhythms, or arrhythmias; both stroke and arrhythmias have the potential
to cause sudden death.
Sleeping is not uniform and consists of four stages: N1, N2, N3, and REM sleep. The
analysis of sleep stages is essential for understanding and diagnosing sleep-related diseases, such
as insomnia, narcolepsy , and sleep apnea; however , sleep stage classification often does not
generalize to patients with sleep apnea. The goal of our project is to build a sleep stage classifier
specifically for people with sleep apnea and understand how it dif fers from the normal sleep
stage. We will then explore whether or not the inclusion and featurization of ECG data will
improve the performance of our model. The thought process behind this is that ECG readings can
indicate obstructive events during sleep, which gives information about the patient’ s sleep state.
Previous Work
Currently , sleep stage scoring is still typically done by hand, requiring a human to label
each 30 second epoch based on predefined rules [1]. Because of this, the current method of
scoring is somewhat subjective, with human scorers only agreeing 83% of the time [2]. Even
individual scorers only have about 90% agreement with themselves when presented with the
same signal at dif ferent times [3].Motivation and Goals
There has been previous work on sleep band classification, but those models often do not
generalize well to patients with sleep apnea. In particular we suspect that utilizing ECG data may
improve our model’ s performance; this is because patients with sleep apnea frequently wake
during their sleep cycle. These obstructive events can be identified using ECG data and,
therefore, considered by the model.
Our project aims to further explore the relationship between sleep stages and OSA  by
using polysomnography data made available from previous studies, which includes EEG
(electroencephalogram), ECG (electrocardiogram), EOG (electrooculography), and EMG
(electromyography) signals gathered from a mixture of healthy individuals and individuals with
OSA.
Data
The data we have chosen to work with comes from the
National Sleep Research Resource
(NSRR). Specifically , we used the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) which consists of two visits
and the respective overnight polysomnography data which “records your brain waves, the
oxygen level in your blood, heart rate and breathing, as well as eye and leg movements” [4].
Since the second visit has less participants and was done more recently , to make sure we had a
more reliable and complete dataset, we continued with the second visit (SHHS 2). This visit
consists of 3,295 subjects along with their demographics.
Each individual has a 9-hour recording of EEG, EOG, EMG, and ECG signals in 30
second periods. The image below represents the raw polysomnography recordings and the
following image graphs the signal recordings over time.
Featur e Extraction
A)
ECG, EOG, EMG signals and demographics Featur e Extraction
In order to extract features from EEG, EMG, EOG signals and the demographics of
individuals, we followed the preprocessing and feature extraction process found in the YASA
Github, which is an open source and free Python library . For each night, the models extract a
single central EEG, left EOG, chin EMG, then downsamples these signals to 100 Hz and
band-pass filtered them between 0.40 Hz and 0.30 Hz.
From these signals, features were extracted in two forms: time-domain and
frequency-domain. Time-domain features comprise standard descriptive statistics such as
standard deviation, interquartile range, skewness, and kurtosis of the signal. Frequency-domain
features were extracted from the periodogram of the signal including the relative spectral power
in bands, the absolute power of band signals, and power ratios.
While human experts take consecutive epochs into consideration in the scoring sleep
process, common machine learning algorithms today rely only on each individual epoch. To seek
the contextual temporal information, the YASA  model adopts a smoothing approach using 2
rolling windows: “a 7.5 minutes centered and triangular -weighted rolling average and a rolling
average of the last 2 minutes prior to the current epoch” [7]. This rolling average method
overcomes the previous dilemma by incorporating the past signal information and makes the
feature extraction results more reliable.
ECG signal Featur e Extraction
The library we used to extract ECG features is SleepECG. It provides tools for sleep
stage classification when EEG signals aren't available in the dataset, which is still the most
common way to determine sleep stage. Because this library is half finished and we already have
read the data and done the data cleaning part in the previous part, we mainly just use the feature
extraction from the module to featurize our ECG data.
The ECG feature extraction process is based on the heart rate variability features. The
SleepECG module provides 26 time domain features and 7 frequency domain features. All the
time domain features are derived from the normal to normal (NN) intervals, successive
differences between NN intervals, and Poincare plot. As the figure shows on the right, the
normal to normal interval is the intervals
between normal R-peaks. The dif ference
between the NN interval and RR interval is
subtle; and an abnormal R-peaks can occur
when there is “the presence of recurring
arrhythmic events (also known as cardiac
dysrhythmia or irregular heartbeats), as well as
erroneous beat detection due to low signal
quality” [5]. In a time-series, the Poincare plot
depicts the correlation between two consecutive
data points. In our case, it is
a certain NN
interval on the
x
-axis versus NN(
n
+ 1) (the succeeding
NN  interval) on the
y
-axis. Derived
from the three measures, SleepECG allows us to extract time domain features such as the
average, maximum, minimum of NN intervals. SleepECG also provides a method to extract
frequency domain features by using Welch’ s method to power spectral density [8]. Some
examples of ECG frequency-domain features are the variance of NN intervals over the temporal
segment, power in very low/low/high frequency range etc.
Model
The LGBM algorithm is a fast, distributed, high performance gradient boosted
framework based on decision tree algorithms [6]. It is a relatively new algorithm that is
challenging and outperforming existing algorithms. Most decision tree algorithms grow by
level-wise. That is, they grow horizontally . However , LGBM is unique because it grows
leaf-wise or vertically . It will choose the leaf with the max delta loss to grow which can reduce
more loss. The visual below helps to explain the dif ference in growth:
The advantages of this algorithm is that it has fast training speed, higher ef ficiency , lower
memory usage, better accuracy , support of GPU learning, and handles lar ge-scale data. On the
other hand, the disadvantages are that it is sensitive to overfitting and doesn’ t work well with
small datasets.
Results
Our first model without ECG data featurized had a
total of 151 features while our second
model with ECG data had a total 184 features. Our training and validation accuracy in the table
below shows that the first model without ECG performed better than the model with ECG
features.
Furthermore, a confusion matrix allows us to look
more closely into the accuracies within
each sleep stage. It shows us the accuracy between the predicted sleep stage and the actual sleep
stage. Below , the left matrix represents the first model without ECG signals, and the right matrix
represents the model with ECG signals. The scores show that both models performed fairly well
for N2 and W (Wake) sleep stage classification. However , it is clear that the model with ECG
features performed worse than the model without ECG features particularly in stages N3 and R
(REM). It's also important to note that both models performed poorly when classifying sleep
stage N1. This is a known issue present in previous sleep stage classification models, and could
be a possible future work to discover or improve in the model.
Next,
these graphs show the feature importance for
the models. This first graph below is
for the model without ECG data featurized.
It is clear
that the most important features come from
EOG and EEG signals. It is interesting to note that while time elapsed was an important feature
for the existing YASA  model, it is not nearly as important in our model (ranked 51 in
importance). For normal patients during a night of sleep, the periods of REM sleep towards the
beginning are shorter and periods toward the end are longer . This suggests that how long the
patient has been asleep af fects their current sleep state; hence, its feature importance in the
previous model. Since our models only deal with sleep apnea patients, it is possible that because
their sleep is frequently interrupted, their sleep doesn’ t develop over time in the same way that
healthy sleepers do. This would explain why the total time elapsed lacks importance in our
models.
This next graph is for the model that includes ECG features. Although features extracted
from ECG data are in the top 3 most important here, its importance is relatively low compared to
the first two features which come from EOG and EMG data. Interestingly , the second model
seems to rely heavily on one or two features, which can explain its decrease in performance. This
may have been caused by the fact that we added too many new features, which increased the
search space for our model. As a result, our model only found a very small subset of features to
focus on in order to make predictions.
The last figure below shows the F1-scores by sleep
stage of both models. The F1-score is
the harmonic mean of the precision and recall of a classifier , which allows us to compare the
performance of these models. The left plot is for the model without ECG data and the right plot
is for the model with ECG data. Once again, the figure shows that both models struggle with N1
sleep stage classification. Noticeably , the model with ECG data struggles to classify the N3 sleep
stage much more than the original model without ECG data.
Conclusion
To our surprise, the inclusion of features extracted
from ECG data did not improve the
model's performance. The model with ECG features performed roughly 5-6% worse in training
and validation accuracy compared to the original model without ECG features. This means that
our featurization of ECG data did not help the model classify sleep stages for patients with sleep
apnea. Even though our findings did not match our hypothesis, our work was still important for
future research within the area of sleep analysis or sleep stage classifying. Our findings may help
direct others to exclude ECG signals in their models or dive deeper into the reasoning behind
why ECG signals may not work so well. Furthermore, a potential future research could be
improving N1 sleep stage classification as we mentioned earlier .
Limitations and Discussion
Featur e Extraction:
While YASA  implements a temporal
time window to incorporate
contextual temporal information, the SleepECG which is the library we used to extract the ECG
features does adopt the rolling average method. The feature extraction of ECG still follows an
old-school approach by focusing on what happened in each epoch and treating each epoch
independently . In further studies, the temporal time window and the rolling average can be
applied to extract ECG features, which make them more informative and reliable.
Model Selection:
Different models can be implemented
in further studies. In our project,
we choose to use the LGBM algorithm, which is based on decision trees and supports the
computation of lar ge amounts of input data. Our project provides a baseline for model
comparison, and further models or deep learning algorithms might improve the performance of
classifying sleep stages even more.

Abstr act
Burn severity maps are an important tool for understanding fire damage and managing
forest recovery. We have identified several issues with current mapping methods used by
federal agencies that affect the completeness, consistency, and efficiency of their burn
severity maps. In order to address these issues, we demonstrate the use of machine
learning as an alternative to traditional methods of producing severity maps, which rely
on in-situ data and spectral indices derived from image algebra. We have trained several
supervised classifiers on sample data collected from 17 wildfires across Northern
California and evaluate their performance at mapping fire severity.
1   Introduction
In recent years, wildfires have been growing into a much larger environmental and
public safety threat. Fire seasons are larger, more destructive, and burning longer than
ever before that the US Forest Service has coined the term “fire year”. The exact causes
for this behavior are not known, but scientists point to climate change, increased human
activity from expansion into rural areas, and over-zealous fire prevention policies that
have created environments ripe for wildfires with large buildups of combustible fire
fuels. [
1
] This phenomenon is happening across the
world, but is especially apparent in
Northern California, which has historically been a global hotspot for wildfires. The 2018
fire season, the worst in California’s history, was responsible for an estimated $102.6
billion in damages in California. [13] In addition to extensive economic damage, wildfires
also pose a significant health hazard by exposing millions of people along the West Coast
to harmful aerosol pollutants, such as ash and dust. Our preliminary analysis also
confirms that wildfires are more frequent and destructive. From 1990-2020 there has
been a 267% increase in the number of fires annually and in the past 20 years there has
been a 520% increase in the number of fire seasons that exceed 500,000 burned acres
compared to the 50 years prior.
1.1   What is Burn Severity?
To clarify on the meaning and usage of wildfire jargon, fire intensity is strictly used to
describe the total amount of energy released by a fire, while fire or burn severity
describe the effect of fire on aboveground and belowground biomass. This includes
measures like canopy cover, crown volume, surface litter, and soil hydrophobicity. These
terms are often used interchangeably, but a minor distinction is that in certain
applications burn severity can specifically refer to fire effects on soil. [2] Our analysis
uses remote sensing data to specifically measure the effect of wildfire on above and
belowground biomass, which we refer to interchangeably as fire or burn severity. This
definition is widely used by federal fire mapping groups and past research on wildfires.
Burn severity maps are widely used by federal agencies and forest managers to map fire
damage and extent, prioritize forest recovery efforts, update vegetation and land cover
maps, monitor ecosystem health, and assess the risks of any downstream impacts in the
future. Fire mapping responsibilities are shared by several federal interagency groups,
mainly Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (
MTBS
),
Rapid Assessment of Vegetation
Condition after Wildfire (
RAVG
), and Burned Area Emergency
Response (
BAER
).
Traditional methods of producing these maps are expensive and time-consuming since
they require teams of surveyors and ecologists to gather in-situ data. For many fires, this
is infeasible due to harsh terrain and weather. These methods are still used for certain
fires, but have been largely phased out with the introduction of remotely sensed data
from Earth observing satellites. Fires can be mapped at a much faster and larger scale at
a fraction of the cost relative to field surveys, while still maintaining high accuracy.
Remote sensing data is widely used in many other applications, such as agriculture,
climate change, and natural disasters, since they cover long time spans and are
continuously updated with high resolution, multi-spectral data.
The most widespread spectral index for identifying burned areas and fire severity levels
is the Normalized Burn Ratio,𝑁𝐵𝑅 =(𝑁𝐼𝑅 − 𝑆𝑊𝐼𝑅)(𝑁𝐼𝑅 + 𝑆𝑊𝐼𝑅)=(𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑑 5 − 𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑑 7)(𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑑 5 + 𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑑 7) 
The near-infrared band (
N I R
) is sensitive to chlorophyll
present in live vegetation, while
the short-wave infrared band (
S W I R
) is primarily sensitive
to water content in soil and
vegetation. It has also been shown to be capable of discerning dead wood from burned
soil, ash, and charred wood. As a result, NBR is sensitive to live, photosynthetically active
vegetation, moisture content, and certain post-fire surface conditions. [
3
] To measure the
effect of fire, NBR is computed for pre and post fire images and their results are
differenced (dNBR). A set of thresholds corresponding to different burn severities is then
applied to produce a burn severity map. Federal fire-mapping groups mainly use this
approach, but with slight differences based on their organizational needs.
A weakness of using dNBR is that it tends to underestimate burn severity in regions that
are less vegetated or have mixed land cover types with shrubs and grasslands. For
example in the figure below, forest A has half the pre-fire vegetation of forest B and C.
Forest A and B both experience almost total vegetation loss from a fire and should bothbe classified as experiencing a high severity burn. Forest C also has a fire and loses about
half of its trees and should be classified as a moderate severity burn. However since
Forest A has less pre-fire vegetation than Forest B, its dNBR value is much lower and
about the same as Forest C’s dNBR value. This implies that the burn severity classification
of Forest A and C would be the same, even though Forest A has the same post-fire state as
Forest B.
This leads to an underestimate of burn severity that skews the results of fire severity
maps. A relativized version of dNBR, rdNBR, has been shown to perform better in
regions that are less vegetated and have mixed vegetation types, but it isn’t as commonly
used.[
3
]
1.2   Federal Fire Mapping Groups
The main groups responsible for mapping fires in the US are MTBS, RAVG, and BAER.
MTBS is the largest and most active federal mapping group and in California it maps fires
larger than 5000 acres. RAVG maps fires that occur on at least 1000 acres of National
Forest System (NFS) land and produces results usually within 60 days of fire
containment. It specifically focuses on changes in canopy cover and basal area. BAER is
slightly different since its main goal is to assess soil burn severity and identify and
prescribe treatments for any hazards caused by fire, like water runoff from hydrophobic
soil. Within a week of a fire’s containment it provides satellite imagery and preliminary
burn severity data to field teams, made up of ecologists, soil scientists, and engineers,
that work in the field to stabilize a region. [
7
]
Several issues currently hinder the effectiveness of burn severity maps produced by
these groups. Due to various agency requirements, lack of resources, and the immense
number of wildfires every year, federal agencies are only able to map a fraction of
wildfires. This leads to lacking fire documentation and coverage, which could limit the
work of groups that depend on fire severity maps. In addition there is a lack of
“completeness” in the data used to produce fire severity maps. Only two spectral bands,
N I R
and
S W I R
, are used from Landsat to calculate dNBR
and contextual data, like land
cover or weather aren’t used. This additional data could contain relevant information
that can be uncovered with machine learning.
The second issue relates to the consistency of severity maps. Maps produced by MTBS
rely on analysts to subjectively determine dNBR thresholds to produce severity
classifications. These thresholds are not validated with field data or ecologically
quantified so the consistency of their maps is questionable. [7]
Another source of inconsistency is the use of different pre and post fire images since
these agencies operate separately and on different timelines. Ideally, the selected
pre-post fire images are as close to a fire as possible because using images that are
further apart can influence results. For example, selecting a post fire image from a later
date allows vegetation regrowth from fire or seasonal changes in vegetation to occur. Or
if a fire occurs in November but a pre-fire image from spring is used, this can increase a
fire’s dNBR value since the absolute decrease in vegetation is greater. [
8
] For these
reasons, agencies often come up with conflicting results. Figures 3a-b demonstrate this
issue with the 2013 Rim Fire near Yosemite National Park.
The third issue, which only affects MTBS, is the speed at which severity maps are
produced. They release maps on a two year lag and as of today still have not released any
for fires from the 2020 and 2021 fire seasons. This delay is likely due to the large number
of fires they are responsible for and the amount of human influence required.
1.3   Related Research
Fire severity is a well researched topic and common approaches revolve around in-situ
sampling and spectral indices derived from image algebra, similar to other change
detection applications.[
9
] In recent years machine
learning applications for remote
sensing have been growing in popularity, but are still fairly limited. This has been
attributed to the limited support of machine learning methods in traditional remote
sensing software, confusion on how to apply ML models, contradictory model
performance, and parametric methods still being extremely popular even though they
have been shown to perform worse overall. [
4
][
10
]
Machine learning models perform
well at modeling complex relationships between features and benefits from large,
high-dimensional datasets, which are common with remote sensing datasets.
Given these benefits, we propose the use of machine learning methods with remote
sensing data to map fire severity. This would address the issues highlighted above and
reduce human subjectivity, allow maps to be produced at a faster and larger scale, and
allow us to incorporate additional spectral bands along with contextual data including
weather, land cover, and terrain. We plan to train our models using data sampled from
17 wildfires in Northern California and evaluate their performance on other wildfires in
the region. A study similar in scope to ours was conducted by training a random forest
classifier (RF) over in-situ and remote sensing data from 8 fires in Victoria, Australia.
They found that RF generally produced more accurate burn severity results than a
traditional spectral indexing approach. [
5
]
1.4   Region of Interest
Our study will be focused on Northern California since it is a global hotspot for wildfires
that has affected a majority of students at UCSD. In addition, its infamous wildfires are
well documented by CALFIRE, have been researched significantly in the past, and there
are many remote sensing datasets that cover this region.
A majority of counties in Northern California
are very rural, have sparse populations, and are
mostly undeveloped. Their land covers are
largely dominated by conifer forests, low-lying
shrubland, annual grassland, and mixed
chaparral. These vegetation types are known to
be conducive to wildfires as some chaparral
species release flammable resins that help it
propagate its seeds during wildfires. Conifer
trees also produce lots of surface litter and tree
sap that are easily combustible. These counties
account for a majority of wildfires and related
damages. Counties located in Central California
near Sacramento, like Yolo, Sutter, and San
Joaquin, are more developed and revolve around agriculture and livestock. On average
these counties experience less than 2 wildfires per year, usually under 1000 acres.
Northern California is historically prone to wildfire since it doesn’t experience much
rainfall and has dry, hot summers that lead to large accumulations of combustible fire
fuels in the fall. Environmental factors, like strong downslope winds and lightning
strikes, and human activity are common wildfire ignition sources. [
1
] California is
especially susceptible to long droughts and often experiences consecutive dry years,
which are characteristic of regions with Mediterranean type climates. As the effects of
climate change become more apparent, droughts and wildfires in California will be a
greater environmental and public safety hazard.

Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud-based distributed computing environment that
greatly reduces the technical barriers to entry for large scale geospatial analysis and
hosts a large catalog of data including satellite imagery, climate forecasts, and
geophysical data.[

and run computations on

Data on California wildfire seasons from 1950-2020 is provided by

and includes
information on a fire’s location, geometry, size, and duration.
2.1   Fire and Image Selection
In total, 17 fires were selected from a candidate set of 79 fires. The fires occurred across
Northern California between 2013-2020 because this coincides with the launch of
Landsat 8 (February 2013) and the California wildfire dataset hasn’t been updated to
include any fires past the 2020 fire season. All selected fires are at least 10,000 acres in
size because fires of this size are better documented and have more pixels to sample.
To get optimal pre and post fire images from Landsat 8, we considered all images that
occurred 60 days before and after a fire. Images were selected based on their proximity
to a fire’s start or end and the presence of environmental factors that reduce image
quality, like clouds, smoke, and snow. A majority of pre-fire images are within 14 days of
a fire’s ignition, but some post-fire images occur much later due to poor image quality.2.2   Data Extraction
In addition to surface reflectance data from Landsat 8, we also used land cover,
elevation, and weather data from
NLCD
,
NASA SRTM
,
and
gridMET
respectively. These
images are clipped over each fire’s bounding box and their bands are merged into a
single image in GEE. The selected Landsat 8 images are pre-orthorectified to account for
terrain and we used the standard image differencing method to calculate dNBR.
Using proposed burn severity values from the USGS, which we simplified from seven
classes to five, we classified each pixel as either vegetation growth, unburned, low
severity burn, moderate severity burn, and high severity burn. [
2
] We simplified the land
cover classes used by the NLCD  and remapped  them to six classes: developed, forest,
shrub, grassland, agriculture, and other. Pixels that are marked as bodies of water,
perennial snow, barren rock, or wetlands are reclassified as “other”. This makes our data
easier to interpret and removes redundant land cover classes that aren’t present in
Northern California. Rasters for each fire are extracted from GEE with varying cell size
(30m - 90m) based on fire size. Variable cell sizes serve as a soft regularization technique
to even out the number of data points between larger and smaller fires. Increasing the
cell size for large wildfires was crucial for staying within memory resources. The model
interpretability does not suffer much between fire sizes since the cell size of feature
datasets are larger.
3   Methods
3.1   Feature Selection and Engineering
Feature selection was performed by keeping all features with coefficients greater than
0.02in a fitted Logistic Regression model. The most important features were NDVI,
elevation, Landsat 8 Bands 1-7, land cover, and tree cover percentage. Our simplified
land cover classes are one hot encoded and all the features were standardized to prevent
one feature’s variance from dominating the other features in the dataset.
To train and
validate our models, we randomly split our sampled wildfire data to 80% training data
and 20% testing data.
3.2   Models
Logistic Regression
Our Logistic Regression model had an accuracy of around 80% when tested on our test
data. This model performed the best in predicting unburned areas with an accuracy of
around 84%. On the other hand, this model had the worst accuracy (~58%) in predicting
low burn severity areas. One limitation of this model is that it assumes linearity between
the features and the target classes.
Mutli-Layer Perceptron Classifier
The Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier model has a major advantage in that it can learn
non-linear relationships in data. This model produced an accuracy of around 86%,
slightly better than the Logistic Regression model. This model performed the best in
predicting unburned areas with an accuracy of around 90% while it had the worst
accuracy (66%) in predicting high burn severity areas.
Random Forest Classifier
The Random Forest Classifier consistently has an accuracy of about 85% without any
parameter tuning. This performance is expected since previous studies have shown that
Random Forests perform well without any parameter tuning and do not overfit to
training data as the number of trees and leaves increase.
[
11
] [
12
]
Similar to our Logistic Regression model, our Random Forest Classifier model performed
the best in predicting unburned areas with an accuracy of around 92%. This model has
the worst accuracy in predicting low burn severity and high burn severity areas which
both had an average burn severity of 77%. Overall, this model had the most consistent
accuracy results across all target classes.
Support Vector Classifier
Support Vector machines were a good candidate due to its strength in geospatial
applications and generalization qualities. This model’s performance was especially
sensitive to seasonality
Logit Boost/Adaboost
Boosting methods have been shown to be effective in modeling fire severity. Each model
is a variation of boosted trees with different loss functions. These models were not as
robust as the bagging methods and tended to overpredict the burned perimeter more
often than other methods.
4   ResultsTo evaluate how generalizable our models are to other Northern California wildfires, we
benchmarked their performances on fires of varying sizes, times of year, and land cover
types. These factors can affect fire behavior and produce inaccurate or skewed model
results. We selected 5 fires that represent these different factors to demonstrate the
strength and weaknesses of our models.

We tested our models’ performance on several small wildfires. Most fires in Northern
California are under 10,000 acres in size, but the fires we selected to train our models on
are all above this size. This led to some concerns on if our models would be able to
accurately map these smaller fires. The Slink and Abney Fires are used to demonstrate
how the effects of winter pose a significant challenge to our models and offer directions
for further improvement. We selected the Atlas and Steele Fire to test how our models
perform in mixed and heterogeneous shrubland environments. These land cover types
are known to be difficult to map with linear dNBR thresholding and often require human
subjectivity in setting thresholds. We show that our models are robust to these conditions
and can produce accurate burn severity maps.
In general, our models perform best on fires in non-winter months that have forested or
mixed land cover types. With fires in these ideal conditions, our models are able to
accurately identify the shape of a fire and classify unburned areas with up to 90% recall
and precision. In ecosystems that are mostly shrub and grassland, our models produce
mixed results and are capable of identifying fire scars, but are also prone to underfitting
burn severities. Since our approach only requires post-fire data, our models are more
robust to noise from seasonal vegetation loss and less sensitive to snow in post fire
images. One of the weaknesses of our models is that they can struggle to identify pixels
with vegetation growth and high severity burns. This is likely due to pixels with these
classes not occurring frequently in our training data. Another issue is that our models
tend to misclassify burned pixels as being unburned, which leads to some predicted burn
severity maps being sparse and discontinuous.
4.2   Different Sized Fires
We found that the size of a fire did not affect the performance of our models, despite not
having any training data from fires below 10,000 acres. This possibly suggests that the
behavior of small fires doesn’t vary much from bigger fires and could be a direction for
further research. Other factors related to seasonal changes and land cover type are
found to be very influential in model performance for fires of all sizes.4.3 Season
We found that seasonal changes in vegetation and the presence of snow were a major
roadblock to producing burn severity maps for fires in winter months with either
method. For example we tested our models on the Slink Fire (2020) which burned in the
Sierra Nevadas late into the fire season. As a result, the candidate set of post-fire images
are strongly affected by snow and seasonal vegetation loss.  The fire scar is fairly visible
in Figure 7b, but is partly obscured by snow, which is blue in the false color image, in the
central part of the fire and in the surrounding region.
An issue with the thresholded map in Figure 7c is that there are many pixels classified as
vegetation growth, mostly near regions with snow. In the top right corner of the images
is agricultural land that is unburned by the Slink FIre. However due to crop harvesting
or seasonal changes in winter, this area has less vegetation postfire. As a result, the
linear dNBR threshold picks up on this and misclassifies these pixels as low severity
burns in Figure 7c. These issues contribute a lot of noise to the burn severity map and
can make it more difficult to interpret a fire’s burn severity. As demonstrated with our
MLP classifier in Figure 7d, our models are not as sensitive to these factors and are able
to produce a clear burn severity map that better shows the fires outline.
For fires with heavier snow coverage and seasonal vegetation loss, our models really
broke down and produced inaccurate results. This was very apparent when we tested
our Logistic Classifier on the Abney Fire (2017). In Figure 8b, the fire scar isn’t really
visible and large amounts of snow obscure much of the image.
An issue that stands out with both burn severity maps is that they’re very noisy and don’t
show an identifiable outline of the Abney Fire. This is likely due to winter vegetation loss
being misidentified as burned vegetation. Unlike our other models, the Logistic Classifier
was a lot more sensitive to this noise and also identified snow as a moderate severity
burn.
In general our models perform better than linear thresholds for fires that don’t have
heavy snow coverage or vegetation loss. With the Slink Fire (2020), they correctly
identify pixels with snow as unburned areas and produce a clearer burn severity map.
Our models struggle with fires that have more snow and produce inaccurate results,
which is likely because our training fires are absent of snow and occur mostly in late
summer and fall. Accounting for the issues posed by winter fires could be a direction for
further model tuning and improvement.
4.4 Land Cover
Our model performed well on fires of mixed land covers that occur most frequently in
Napa and Sonoma counties. These fires can be difficult to produce burn severity maps
for because discrete severity thresholds may not accurately represent how fires behave
in different land covers. We tested our models on the Atlas Fire (2017) as it is adjacent to
Napa, CA and has a very mixed land cover composition with lots of agricultural and
urban areas.
Using our MLP classifier we are able to produce a map that accurately identifies burned
and unburned regions and shows the shape of the Atlas Fire. A key difference is that the
map produced by the MLP classifier shows the Atlas Fire as having a significantly more
severe burn compared to the linear threshold method. This is likely a more accurate
assessment of the Atlas Fire as dNBR thresholding is known to underestimate burn
severities in shrub and grassland. [3] A strength of using our models in environments
with mixed land covers is that they are robust to changes in agricultural regions from
crop sowing and harvesting. The linear threshold picks up on these changes and
classifies many pixels on unburned farmland as having a low severity burn or vegetation
growth, which adds a lot more noise.
We also tested our models on the Steele Fire (2017) which occurs in Modoc County, a part
of California that is mostly covered by shrubland.
As mentioned with the Atlas Fire,
dNBR thresholding struggles to produce accurate burn severity classifications for fires in
shrubland and other less vegetated regions. A quick solution around this issue, that is
employed by MTBS, is to have analysts subjectively determine severity thresholds.
However this approach introduces a lot of human influence, produces inconsistent
results, and is time-consuming.
The burn severity map in Figure 10c demonstrates this issue as a large majority of pixels
are classified as unburned. In contrast, the map produced with a Random Forest
classifier in Figure 10d shows that it is much more capable of identifying burned areas
and depicting the fire’s outline. Our training data did not include many fires that
occurred in shrubland dominant ecosystems, so with further model training this result
could likely be improved.
5    Further work
A common issue our models experienced was misidentifying burned pixels as unburned
and this was especially noticeable for fires in shrub and grassland ecosystems. This likely
occurs because our models are trained on burn severity values generated using dNBR
thresholding. Having models trained on burn severity values generated using rdNBR
thresholding instead for fires in these regions could be a workaround solution. Another
solution would be incorporating more training data from a wider set of wildfires in
shrub and grassland environments. This could improve the overall generalizability of
our models in these environments
We decided to use surface reflectance data from Landsat 8 over alternative options, such
as Sentinel-2, because it’s also used by federal fire mapping agencies, has the same
spatial resolution (30m) as our other data, and has been operating for longer, especially if
previous Landsat satellites are considered. However there are several benefits that
Sentinel-2 provides that make it an attractive option to explore.
The first is that since Sentinel-2 is composed of two satellites that orbit in tandem, it has a
much shorter revisit time of 5 days compared to a revisit time of 16 days for Landsat 8.
This means that for a given timespan there is a much larger set of post-fire images to use
and that burn severity maps can be produced faster. Sentinel-2 also provides four bands
that are dedicated to the red edge wavelength range. Reflectance in this part of the
electromagnetic spectrum is highly sensitive to chlorophyll content in vegetation and is
indicative of vegetation health. The addition of these bands is likely helpful for
distinguishing between seasonal vegetation change and burned vegetation. Another
small benefit of using Sentinel-2 is that most of its bands have a spatial resolution of
10-20m, compared to 30m for Landsat 8. This is helpful for working with small fires and
producing more granular burn severity maps.
6   Conclusion
In this paper, we outline several issues with current fire mapping methods used by
federal agencies that lead to inefficient, inconsistent, and incomplete results. Using data
collected from Northern Californian wildfires, we demonstrate how supervised machine
learning classifiers can be a viable alternative to current mapping methods. Our models
work best for fires in non-winter months that occur in forested or mixed land cover
environments and are able to accurately identify unburned areas and map burn
severities. Our work serves as a strong starting point for further research on mapping
and analyzing wildfires with machine learning.References

Abstract
In order to detect issues in network transmission data, we built a
real-time-capable anomaly detection system. This system enables Inter-
net Service Providers (ISP’s) such as Viasat to properly monitor user
network performance and quality in a real time paradigm. We utilize
simulated network traffic data to train a model that predicts the packet
loss rate as well as the latency of an internet connection. The system then
uses these rolling predictions to determine moments of significant network
quality degradation within the simulated data. This approach had a less
than ideal performance on predicting actual values in packet loss rate and
latency, but still captured strong signals of when these measures would
significantly worsen.
1 Introduction
Network degradation occurs in many forms, and our project will focus on two
common factors: packet loss and latency. Packet loss occurs when one or more
data packets transmitted across a computer network fail to reach their destina-
tion. Latency can be defined as a measure of delay for data to transmit across
a network. For internet users, high rates of packet loss and significant latency
can manifest in jitter or lag, which are indicators of overall poor network perfor-
manceasperceivedbytheenduser. Thus, whenissuesariseinthesetwofactors,
it would be beneficial for internet service providers to know exactly when the
user is experiencing problems in real time. In real world scenarios, situations or
1environments such as poor port quality, overloaded ports, network congestion
and more can impact overall network performance. In order to detect some of
these issues in network transmission data, we built an anomaly detection system
that predicts the estimated packet loss and latency of a connection and detects
whether there is a significant degradation of network quality for the duration of
the connection.

2 Data
Using a tool called DANE, we could generate records of simulated network
traffic with varying rates of packet loss and latencies. This helped us create and
capture data of a wide variety of unique network conditions. We then built on
top of this dataset by transforming them in the process of feature engineering
based on investigations made about their distributions.
2.1 Data Generation with DANE
The simulated network data used for our models were generated with a network
emulation tool built by a previous capstone project team. DANE, which stands
for Data Automation and Network Emulation, is a dataset generation tool that
can emulate diverse ranges of network traffic representative of the real world.
TheDANEtoolallowsustocustomconfigurenetworkconditionssuchaslatency
and packet loss and generate network traffic data associated with the configured
conditions. For any anomaly detection system, diversity in conditions is crucial
to adequately cover the variance of real world scenarios. With a feature to
create custom profiles of network traffic scenarios, DANE allows us to properly
2emulate the diversity and variety of network conditions that occur in the real
world.
The data generated by DANE for our project includes various packet loss
and latency scenarios in which packets were dropped randomly from a uniform
distribution. For each scenario, a simulated “anomaly” is configured around
midpoint time by changing the loss and latency values. For example, the set
loss would drop from 20000 to 200, indicating a major shift in loss which would
be the simulated anomaly (we discuss our definition of an anomaly later in the
anomaly classifier section). Empirical loss values are also included from DANE
as a true value measure against the predicted values of our model. This data
was generated manually on our Windows computers.
2.2 Exploring the feature space
Figure 1: Correlations between a combination of temporal and throughput-
based features that were engineered for our model
3In our exploration of the features, we found that the most effective features
that captured network behaviors could be categorized into two distinct cate-
gories: temporal-based and throughput-based. The temporal features used are
as follows:
•number_ms : The number of unique millisecond timestamps between sec-
onds.
•mean_tdelta : The mean of differences between sequential packet trans-
mission timestamps between seconds.
•max_tdelta : Themaximumofdifferencesbetweensequentialpackettrans-
mission time stamps between seconds.
•time_spread : The range between the earliest arriving packet and latest
packet timestamp within a second.
•longest_seq : Thelongestsequenceofconsecutivepackettransmissiontime
stamps that have the same.
Many of these features were our best proxies for a measure determining the
rate at which packets came in, and as a result were useful to our models in
predicting latency. There is likely a moderately strong relationship between a
packet’s timing in being transmitted and its latency.
Figure 2: The median max_tdeltas for different latencies
The throughput features are as follows:
•total_pkts : Total number of packets.
•total_pkt_sizes : the sum of all byte sizes of each packet in a second,
comparable to total_bytes.
•2-1Bytes : The number of packets received in one second from IP address
2 (sender) to address 1 (receiver).
4•byte_ratio : The ratio of bytes being received divided by the number of
bytes being sent back from IP address 1.
•pkt_ratio : The ratio of packets being received divided by the number of
bytes being sent back from IP address 1.
•total_bytes : the sum of all bytes being sent or received within a second.
•2-1Pkts: The number of bytes received in one second from IP address 2
(sender) to address 1 (receiver).
These features on throughput, on the other hand, helped us much more
in determining packet loss rates. Our investigations into how connections are
established helped us understand that the network throttles when a packet loss
eventoccurs, likelytoreducetheburdenontheconnectionpaththatthepackets
are taking. Disregarding phenomena such as rate limiting, packets tend to be
sent as fast as possible through the network.

53 Methods
3.1 Pipeline
Figure 4: The end-to-end pipeline for our project
We first allocate our raw data generated from DANE into train and test sets
for our model. Both sets are cleaned and transformed through the same cleaning
process. The features for the train set are aggregated over a 20 second window
and fed into our regression model for training. After training, we implement
performance tuning and grid search to further improve the baseline model.
In order to properly test our model with unseen data and emulate real-time
prediction, we transform our test data into 20 second rolling window aggrega-
tions that are inputted in intervals into the regression model for evaluation. The
rolling windows simulate a real-time anomaly detection system where a model
would work on a stream of data and would not be able to look ahead beyond
the past and present features.
Ourregressionmodelshouldoutputpredictionsonlossrateandlatencyin20
second rolling window aggregations. These predictions act as the fundamental
metric driving the classification of what we would consider an anomaly. Our
anomaly detection mechanism compares changes in the predictions with a set
threshold that ultimately determines whether an anomaly is flagged or not. A
deeper explanation of the anomaly classifier is detailed later in the anomaly
classifier section. The pipeline was set up locally on our Windows computers as
well as in DSMLP.
63.2 Regression Model
Most of the models we implemented were tree-based regression models. A gen-
eral decision tree was able to manage highly correlated features. This tree based
model considers all possible outcomes of a decision and traces each path to a
conclusion. However, thelackofrandomnessinthismodelcanleadtooverfitting
when dealing with too many variables.
On the other hand, in a randomized decision tree, each tree in the ensemble
is built from a sample drawn with replacement from the training data. The
best split is found either from all input features or a random subset of size
max_features. Overall a randomized decision tree is good for reducing variance.
This is good for overfitting, but may lead to bias.
The model we landed on was the extra trees model. This model is similar
to the randomized decision tree, however instead of taking the best split of
features, a random subset of candidate features is used. For an extra trees
model, thresholds are drawn at random for each candidate feature and the best
of these randomly-generated thresholds is picked as the splitting rule. This
method can reduce more variance than a random forest, but can lead to even
more bias.
Predictingforlossusingfeaturesrelatedtothroughputinformationwasvalu-
able to provide the model with the relevant information. Some of these features
include bytes to packet ratio, packet ratio, total bytes, and the bytes that were
able to travel from the sender to the receiver. The packet loss features used
were:
byte_ratio ,pkt_ratio ,time_spread ,total_bytes ,2-1Pkts.
To predict for latency, features such as the number of unique millisecond
timestamps between seconds and the maximum and means of differences be-
tween sequential packet transmission time stamps between seconds provided
the model with useful information to train on. Interruptions in smooth trans-
mission of data can impact latency, so the addition of features like the longest
sequence of consecutive packet transmission time stamps allows the model to
train on packet travel patterns and when interruptions occur. The final latency
features used were:
total_pkts ,total_pkt_sizes ,2-1Bytes ,number_ms ,mean_tdelta ,max_tdelta ,
time_spread ,longest_seq .
Asbothofthemodelsdealwithfeaturesthatarehighlycorrelated, e.g. mea-
sure byte ratio/transmission and packet/temporal information, applying PCA
found a new set of variables, reducing the dataset dimensionality to four and
retains 99 percent of the variance of the original dataset, retaining its trends
and patterns. This smaller dimension has the benefit of speeding up the model
training process.
73.3 Anomaly Classifier
Figure 5: Detailed overview of anomaly detection system
Finally, we implemented and integrated the anomaly detection mechanism
for the system, which ingested the predictions from our regression model and
identified anomalies in 20 second windows. We narrowed our definition of an
anomaly to any significantly rapid increase in packet loss rate/latency over two
seconds. We then manually tuned for percent change thresholds that worked
well for detecting these events.
3.4 Results
Overall,thepredictivemodelperformancewasmoderatelylow. Usingthemetric
of Mean Absolute Percent Error, we determined that the model’s predictions on
average were off by about 40-70%. Using our other metric of predictions that
fell within a 15% margin, we saw that predictions that fell within our acceptable
error rates made up a measly 10-20% on all test set predictions.
Regardless of the model’s middling performance on prediction, we were still
abletoproduceafunctionalanomalyclassificationsystemontopofthesepredic-
tions. Shifting our focus from model performance on static predictions to shifts
in predictions, we utilized the prediction values in this real-time paradigm to de-
tect significant changes in the output based on percent change between seconds.
With a moderate amount of manual tweaking, we came up with two functional
thresholds for changes in predictions. For finding anomalies in latency, we de-
cided that a 6% shift in predictions over the span of two seconds gave a good
balance of low false positive rate and decent anomaly classification accuracy in
the resulting network configuration record. For packet loss rate, the percentage
shift was 15
8Figure 6: Anomaly detection system applied to packet loss ratio
As seen inthese resultant graphs above, wenote that ourclassificationpower
is relatively decent despite the inaccuracies inherent in the prediction. In our
testing, there was a 1 in 6 failure rate in identifying an anomaly. Our test
set evaluated significant changes on a magnitude of about a tenfold increase in
packet loss, which a 15% manually set threshold was able to capture quite well.
Even so, in the one example where there is failure, we can see that there is a
false positive. Rarely did false positives come up, but often was the case that for
higher loss rates, the behavior is one where the speed ramps down dramatically
at the start.
9Figure 7: Anomaly detection system applied to latency
Following loss is latency. In the graphs above, we note that our classification
power is comparatively but only moderately worse than packet loss rate despite
the inaccuracies inherent in the prediction. In our testing, there was a 1 in 6
failurerateinidentifyingananomaly, whichissurprisinglywellincomparisonto
our predictive power. Our test set evaluated significant changes on a magnitude
of about a five to six fold increase in latency, which a 6% manually set threshold
was able to capture quite well. There are 4 runs that have false positives, this
was due to the reduced predictive power of our latency regression model. Below
are the raw statistics on our test set performance:
4 Conclusions
In general, the performance of our regression model for predicting loss and la-
tency were not as accurate as we would have liked. Tuning our regression model
and attempting to improve its predictions was certainly one of the prominent
challenges of the project.
10Nonetheless, our predictions in the larger scheme followed a similar trend to
the empirical loss values and static loss labels. With these trends and utilizing
the threshold mechanism for classification, we were able to achieve relatively
successful detection of anomalies, with about 80% of the test anomalies accu-
rately identified by our system. Since we are building an anomaly detection
system which is meant to find patterns of increasing loss over a period of time,
we consider the system to be a success in that regard. We found that the hur-
dle of inaccurate predictions did not have an immense impact on the broad
view of classifying anomalies, although the classification accuracy could still be
improved further.
4.1 Research Utility
While our predictions still need improvement, we were to explore the complexity
of predicting loss and latency and come up with some useful potential features
for such a model. Predicting loss and latency in real-time can have many ben-
efits in equipping network providers with more actionable information to drive
improvements in the network experiences of their customers. Predictions that
arereal-timecanbeespeciallyhelpfulinreducingdelaysbetweennetworkdegra-
dation and service provider response. More data and information on the nature
of these anomalies and what leads up to them allows for more thorough and cor-
rect responses to degradation from the service provider. An anomaly detection
system with loss and latency model could have valuable practical use in this
regard given that the model would be able to analyze throughput information
leading up to an anomaly. Furthermore, the anomaly identification mechanism
of our system, if extended to a monitoring or alerting system, can provide a
comprehensive medium for service providers to supervise network performance
in a more continuous and prompt manner.
4.2 Limitations
Our project does come with a few notable limitations. Firstly, due to the com-
plexities in capturing real network traffic data with empirical values, our project
hinged on solely the simulated data generated by DANE. While DANE is de-
signed as an emulator of networks, it is not fully indicative of the entire spec-
trum of problems that a network may encounter in the real world. If deployed
in production, our system would likely experience worse performance as it is
biased to the simulated data of DANE. For the purposes of our project, DANE
provided the most practical and viable approach to data generation. However
it is meaningful to note that this means our system is heavily biased towards
the simulated data which would need to be properly handled in a real world
environment.
Relying on DANE for our data generation process also presents resource
constraint issues that could affect the quality of the data generated for our
project. The data for our project was generated concurrently in multiple runs.
11Especially in low packet scenarios that are demanding the upper limits of com-
putational power, running multiple DANE concurrently can result in inexact
data. This is because the system/CPU cannot provide enough resources at the
time to properly execute the DANE runs together, resulting in delays. These
delays manifest in the data through times that are slightly off or inaccurate.
Another limitation is the fact that we attempted to predict anomalous ac-
tivity using these predictions. While this approach is novel in itself, there was
a natural consequence of having more false positives in our anomaly detection
system due to the increased inaccuracy of the prediction. From an information
standpoint, using predictions instead of a defined feature such as those related
to throughput likely resulted in signal degradation and a decreased power in our
classification results.

Introduction
Viasat Inc. is an American communications company that provides high-speed satellite
broadband services and secure networking systems covering military and commercial markets.
Therefore, ensuring high quality network performance is crucial for their business success and
maintaining customer satisfaction. Fundamental factors that af fect network performance are
packet loss and latency . When accessing the internet or any network, small units of data called
pac
kets are sent and received. Packet loss occurs
when one or more of these packets fails to
reach its intended destination. This results in slow service and network disruptions for the user .
Latency is
the delay between a user ’s action and a
web application’ s
response to that action,
often referred to as the total round trip time it takes for a data packet to travel.
The problem we are trying to explore is: can we detect anomalies within network traf fic,
whether it be an increase in the packet loss rate, lar ger latency or both. Packet loss can be caused
by a number of issues, including: network congestion, problems with network hardware,
software bugs and security threats. On the other hand, main factors that af fect network latency
are: the transmission medium (copper cable-based networks vs. modern optic fibers),
propagation (how far apart the networks are), ef ficiency of routers and storage delays.
Ultimately , all of these can cause some form of network degradation and result in an increase in
packets being dropped and an increase in delay of data being sent from one computer to another .
If we observe a drastic change in packet loss, latency and variables correlated with the two (i.e.
an anomaly), then we would also likely expect to see network degradation causing the deviationfrom normal behavior . The ability to detect anomalies on a data stream would be extremely
useful as a monitoring & alerting system for poor network conditions.
We will be using data generated from DANE (Data Automation and Network Emulation
Tool), a tool that
automatically collects network
traffic datasets in a parallelized manner without
background noise and emulates a diverse range of network conditions that are representative of
the real world. Using DANE, we are able to configure parameters such as latency and the packet
loss ratio ourselves. More importantly , we are able to simulate an anomaly by changing the
configuration settings of the packet loss rate and latency mid run. The data collected is already
aggregated per second with these fields: timestamps, IP  and port addresses of the source and
destination, number of bytes and packets sent for each direction of traf fic, the milliseconds of
when each packet was sent, the size of each packet sent and the sequence of direction of each
packet. By having the ability to change the parameters within DANE, we are able to generate as
much data as we need with varying network conditions which is helpful in producing an accurate
model.
Methods
Prior  Work
Last quarter our objective was to develop a machine
learning model that can predict the
packet loss ratio
∈
(0,1) and latency in milliseconds
given a 10 second snapshot of network
traffic. Through this work, we engineered various useful features that correspond to packet loss,
allowing us to carry them over to our work with anomaly detection. Some findings from each of
our projects last quarter include a handful of useful features, a random forest classifier and a
regressor . Each of these models were highly dependent on the features we created, and also wastrained on data that was much more determinant than that we are using now . Since this quarter ’s
work tries to avoid predicting packet loss and latency to determine an anomalous region, most of
the work salvaged from last quarter was the domain expertise, exploratory data analysis and
familiarity with the data generating tool DANE.
The Data
We ran only two scenarios at once to prevent overloading
our CPU by running too many
DANE scenarios concurrently . Each DANE run is 5 minutes long. Key dif ferences from last
quarter is that we are able to change the configuration settings mid-run and packets are now
dropped randomly , rather than
systematically . The configuration change
happens at the 180 second mark and what
we configure for our packet loss rate
determines the likelihood of each packet
being dropped. This way , we are able to
simulate an anomaly within our data and
are able to simulate packet loss in a more
realistic manner . Our steady state had a
packet loss ratio of 1/5,000 and a latency of
40 ms. We are focused on identifying changes of a factor of 4 and above. In our case a packet
loss ratio of 1/1,250  and a latency of 160 ms or greater or a packet loss ratio of 1/20,000 and
latency of 10 ms. First, we removed the first 20 seconds of each CSV  file to get rid of the lar ge
spikes that occur in the beginning. These lar ge spikes occur because the computer pushes as
much data in the beginning of the DANE run but then the  Internet provider slows it back down
The datasets generated include the following features:

Cleaning:
At first glance of the data, we notice a few duplicate time points with unusual IP
addresses. These rows include an insignificant amount of packets sent relative to the rest of the
data, causing us to believe that these are not anomalies – they are irrelevant data points. For this
reason, we have chosen to drop these points.  We also perceive a lar ge, sharp peak in the
beginning of the DANE runs that eventually begins to find the steady state of packet
transmission. This is due to the network initially overcompensating to understand how much
information it can handle in transmission to where a significant amount of data is not lost.Because of this, we have chosen to exclude this period from our training set, since it does not
describe the steady state transitions that we are attempting to model.
Anomaly Definition
The type of behavior we are looking for is dif ferent
from what a conventional anomaly
would behave like. Typical anomalies are characterized by significantly lar ge spikes or drops in a
feature. The behavior we are looking for is more closely related to anomalous regions where the
degradation in the network continues; these anomalies resemble shifts. As we will show in the
next section spikes in our features that would normally resemble anomalous behavior are
perfectly random and not caused by any change in network quality . These anomalies would be
considered false positives if detected.
EDA  and Featur e Engineering
Figur e 1:
The packets per second sent from machine 1 → 2 with conditions of 50 ms latency and
1/2500 packets expected to be dropped with the conditions shifting to 300 ms latency and 1/1250
expected packet drops at 180 seconds.
Since the data generating process and the context
we are using the features is dif ferent
from last quarter ’s project, the features used to detect anomalies may have changed as well.
Comparing last quarter ’s deterministic packet drops data with this quarter ’s random packet drops
data, we can see that the correlation between packets per second and packet loss is still there.
Since packet loss and latency are our only ways of generating an anomaly , features such as
packets per second and other features correlated with packet loss and latency will be our basis for
determining whether there is an anomaly or not.

In the figure 1 above the green lines at the bottom represent packet drops from the
machine sending data while the yellow lines represent packets dropped from the machine
sending acknowledgements. The spikes that would normally be looked at as anomalies happen
when there is a lack of packet drops for a relatively lar ge number of packets being sent. This can
be roughtly modeled by the bernoulie distribution with the packet loss condition being the
probability of a “failure”. All the machine would see is the ratio of packet being dropped in the
last X amount of packets but not the actual probability that we set the packet loss ratio at. So if
we get a relatively low number of failures withing the last X packets this would signal to themachine that the network could handle more packets sent and generate a spike in packets per
second without actually changing the network quality (probability a packets is dropped). These
unlucky low number of failures could be represented by the left tail in a bernouli distribution. As
we can see in figure 1, spikes occurs at 210s and 260s where there has not been a failure in a
relatively lar ge amount of packets being sent but the probability of a packet drop has not
changed. A shift in packets per second occurs when there is a change in the probability of a
packet being dropped (the distribution of packet drops in a given number of packets changes). As
a result our features or models have to be robust to these kinds of spikes but still have the ability
to detect persistent shifts in the data generated. The change in network conditions happens at 180
seconds and as a result the usual packets per second shifts and stays low unlike a spike where the
packets per second would recover in a fairly short amount of time.
Exploration of Anomaly Detection Methods
I.
Forecasting
Since we are dealing with time series data, we can create an anomaly detection model
through the use of forecasting techniques. The basic concept is that we will pick a feature, in this
case total packets sent per second (volume of traf fic) and build a forecast. If the expected value is
outside of our prediction interval (threshold) we will flag it as an anomaly . We are employing a
multivariate time series forecast because we are using predictors other than the series (a.k.a
exogenous variables).
There are a multitude of dif ferent forecasting models to attempt and in our case, we will
be focusing on building an ARIMA  (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) model. This
model
is actually a class of models that ‘explains’
a given time series based on its own pastvalues, that is, its own lags and the lagged forecast errors, so that equation can be used to
forecast future values. Any “non-seasonal” time series that exhibits patterns and is not a random
white noise can be modeled with ARIMA  models. An ARIMA  model can be characterized by 3
terms: p, d, q. P  is the order of the “AR” term which refers to the number of lags of Y to be used
as predictors. Q is the order of the “MA” term which refers to the number of lagged forecast
errors that should go into the model. D is the number of dif ferencing required to make the time
series stationary which is crucial because the term “AR” means that it is a linear regression
model and works best when the predictors are not correlated and are independent of each other .
To hypertune these parameters of (p,d,q), we performed a grid search method and chose
our model based on the AIC
(Akaike Information Criteria).
The AIC is a widely used measure of
a statistical model. It basically quantifies 1) the goodness of fit, and 2) the simplicity/parsimony ,
of the model into a single statistic. When comparing two models, the one with the lower AIC is
generally a “better -fit model”.
To simulate a live stream of data, we chose to implement window intervals of n seconds
to train our ARIMA  model on. With a focus on a lack of false positives and the perspective that
it’s better to let the occasional false negative occur , we found that window intervals of 20
seconds worked best. Therefore, we aggregated our data into 20 second intervals with the mean
of the total packet sent as our feature. Our training data consisted of eighteen 5 minute DANE
runs for a total of approximately an hour and a half of network traf fic. The first 30 minutes of
data is our steady state with a latency of 40 ms and a packet loss ratio of 1/5000. Afterwards, we
had 5 separate, spaced out instances of simulated anomalies with a return to a steady state in
between each case. Each anomaly in our training data changed the latency to 160 ms and the
packet loss ratio to 1/1250.Our test data consisted of twelve 5 minute DANE runs with half of them being steady
state traf fic and the other half with anomalies simulated. These anomalies had dif ferent
configurations from our training set and had latency configurations of 320 ms and packet loss
ratios of either 1/1250 or 1/500.
To flag anomalous behavior , we calculated a 99% prediction interval around each
forecast. If the actual value falls outside this interval, it is flagged as an anomaly . We tuned our
prediction interval range from 95% - 99% and found that a 99% prediction interval was a wide
enough range to limit the amount of false positives and capture extreme anomalous behavior . In
addition, we also log transformed our data (mean of the total packets sent) to reduce the scale
because the original data range was in the thousands and since our model considers forecast
errors as part of the model, our prediction interval was much too wide. By transforming the data
onto a smaller scale, we are better able to capture anomalies.
II.
Isolation For est
In our pursuit to identify anomalies, we explored
using an Isolation Forest model on
varying windows of our time series data to give an “anomaly score” for each data point. This
model tries to separate each point in the data built on the basis of decision trees. Partitions are
created by randomly selecting a feature, then a random split between the minimum and
maximum value of the selected feature. Since outliers are defined to be less frequent than most
regular observations, and are usually much dif ferent in terms of their values, we expect that this
random partitioning places outliers closer to the root of the tree. In essence, a normal point
requires more partitions to be identified than an abnormal point.
For each point, an anomaly score is calculated as:Where h(x) is the path length of observation, c(n) is the average path length of
unsuccessful search in a Binary Search Tree, and n is the number of external nodes.
To emulate a live stream of data, we chose to implement window intervals of n seconds
to train our models on.  Using this approach would yield multiple anomaly scores for each data
point, as the window moves through the time series.  To get a final anomaly score for a given
data point, we just average each score given by the windows including that point.
III.
DBScan
The motivation behind using DBScan was to detect
abnormal changes in the data. This
was before we had a proper definition of an anomaly . DBScan (density based) is particularly
sensitive to spikes since it uses distance and number of points within that distance. Spikes tend to
change rapidly and not have enough points near its peak to form a cluster . As a result spikes were
flagged as an anomaly because they were not in a cluster . Since we wanted to punish false
positives the most we did not use DBScan in our model
IV.
MAD and Median
This model tries to take advantage of the dif ferences
in the features of spikes and shifts in
a time series. Median and median absolute deviation are transformations to the 1 → 2 packets
per second data using a rolling window . Some properties of this transformation: smoothens out
the data, depending on the window size median and MAD is robust against spikes, is sensitive to
shifts in the data. Median and MAD depend on the assumption that spikes are relatively short
and uncommon, and shifts are persistent. When a spike occurs the median would remain almost
unchanged since the data points outside the spike would make up more than 50% of the window
same applies to deviation from the median, hence why lar ger window sizes tend to do better .
Shifts in the data on the other hand eventually result in a shift in the median since they persist
much longer than 50% of the rolling window size. The model determines if a data point is an
anomaly if a transformation of the median and MAD are above a threshold based on the window
size. Deviation from the median was included in the transformation to limit the ef fect of lar ge
variance in the window . If there is a lot of variance but no shift, the data would be above and
below the median so the sum of the deviations would be low in magnitude but in a shift the data
would be either strictly above or below the median and result in a high magnitude. All of these
transformations that picked at dif ferences between spikes, shifts and data with high variance in a
window would be combined to make the presence of a shift more apparent. The transformation
used was:
𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑤) =𝑀𝐴𝐷(𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑤) *𝐷𝑀(𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑤)𝑚𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛(𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑜𝑤)  
Where MAD is median absolute deviation and DM is the sum of the deviation from the median

Metrics
We chose to use F1 score as our metric but also considered
precision in our metrics. Our
motivation behind choosing F1 score and precision is because anomalous regions cause by
network degradation are assumed to be rare. Since the intended use for this ensemble model is to
alert ISP  employees what connections are degraded if too many false positives are being flaggedthen there would not be much signal for an anomaly in the alarm. Our goal is to have the users
trust that if there is an alarm they can be sure that there is network degradation, hence why
precision is considered. We also do not want our model to always predict negative, making it
trivial so F1 score was included.
II.
Forecasting
We trained our model on the first 75 points of data (1,500 seconds or 25 minutes of
network traf fic).  The two graphs show the results of the ARIMA  model on the training set
mentioned above. We can see that the model was able to detect whenever there was a
configuration change which caused the significant drops and in one instance it detected the
recovery when it jumped back to the steady state. One graph shows the results on the normal
scale and the other graph shows the results on the log scale.Figur e 2:
ARIMA  model anomaly detections using a 99% CI on the training set. The conditions
generating the data: 40ms latency and 1/5000 packets dropped shifting to 320ms latency and
1/1250 packets being dropped. Time is measured in units of 20s since the ARIMA  model trains
on 20s aggregations of packets per second as a single data point.
Figur e 3:

data with a log scale. The conditions
generating the data: 40ms latency and 1/5000 packets dropped shifting to 320ms latency and
1/1250 packets being dropped. The ARIMA  forecasts can be seen in orange.
We then ran the model on our test set concatenated to our train data. We can see in figure
4 that there were 2 instances of false negatives where our model did not flag the configuration
change as an anomaly . There was also a lar ge spike in the middle of our steady state traf fic which
was flagged as anomalous, representing one case of a false positive. This window of traf fic just
so happened to have an extremely lar ge volume of packets sent and was not due to a
configuration change. Once again, the first graph shows the results on a normal scale and the
second graph shows the results on the log scale.
Another observation is that our model never detects an anomaly during a resur gence back to a
steady state or during the timeframe soon after .

generating the data: 40ms latency and 1/5000 packets dropped shifting to 320ms latency and

on 20s aggregations of packets per second as a single data point.

III.
Isolation For est
Because of its good reputation with anomaly detection, we went to great lengths to get
the Isolation Forest model to perform well on our data. However , it continued to perform poorly ,
leading us to depreciate it for our final anomaly detection approach.
Figur e 6:
Isolation forest anomaly predictions.
As described above, the Isolation Forest is based upon the principle that anomalies are far
and few . However , since our data is modeling real world instances of network traf fic, we
experience drops in information that are caused by network degradations. These degradations are
the anomalies we are looking for . The nature of these degradations is that it lasts for more than a
few milliseconds, leading the packet transmission to be af fected for a period of time. This leads
us to have anomalous regions rather than single anomalies, which is why Isolation Forests do not
work well. After a failed attempt at creating many new features, transformations, and smoothing,
we decided to not continue with Isolation Forests any further .
IV.
DBScan
The anomalies we were looking for were shifts which generally had many points within
the eps i.e. distance, close enough and abundant enough to form a cluster . These would not be
flagged as anomalies. These two properties can be seen in the graph below . In order to make use
of DBScan we would have to exclusively use features that created a spike or trough when the
shift (an indicator of a change in latency or packet loss) happened and be robust agains spikes
that are a result of unlucky sequences of packet drops.
Figur e 7:
DBScan anomaly predictions. Conditions used
to generate data: 50 ms latency and
1/2500 packets expected to drop shifting to 300ms latency and 1/1250 packets dropped. The red
line indicated the time the condition shift happened. The ticks at the bottom indicate when a
packt was dropped, green is 1 → 2 yellow is 2 → 1.
V.
MAD and Median
The first graph shows the median transformation of 1 → 2 packets using a rolling
window . The second graph shows the MAD of the same graph. The vertical red line is where the
change in the network conditions happens. As shown in the first plot, the median is unaf fected by
any lar ge spikes in the data but responds to the shift in the data, albeit delayed. The delay is a
50% of the window size. Likewise the MAD is fairly resilient to spikes and creates a spike much
larger than any other as a result of the shift in packets per second. The third graph is a
combination of the first and second graph, showing where the anomaly was detected in the
second graph shifted by 50% of the window size (80s).
Figur e 8:
Median on 1 → 2 packets per second with
window size of 80s. Conditions used to
generate data: 50 ms latency and 1/5000 packets expected to drop shifting to 200ms latency and
1/1500 packets dropped. The red line indicated the time of the condition shift. The yellow line
indicates the median of the 80s before it. The first point in the yellow line would indicate the
median of the 80 data points without the yellow line.
Figur e 9:
Transformation of statistics of a time window
i.e. median. Since the transformation
uses a window the spike as a result of the shift is delayed by a function of the window size.

VI.
Ensemble Model
Our method to combine our ARIMA  and MAD model followed a simple logic. We ran
both models independently and compared the results of each model. We used an AND operator
to see where both models detected an anomaly and labeled it as an anomaly . Otherwise, if the
condition is not met, then we do not label it as an anomaly . First, we look at the result of our
MAD model on the same dataset used earlier in the ARIMA  section. The MAD model utilized a
window size of 80 with a threshold of 100 and ‘total packets’  as our feature.
Figur e 11:
MAD anomaly detection model with window
size 80s. Several dane runs were
stitched together .
Here we can see that the MAD model captured every configuration shift and some of the
timeframes when the network goes back to a steady state. However , there are several instances of
false positives that occurred as well. Since MAD takes one second inputs and our ARIMA  takes
in 20 second windows as inputs, we had to transform our ARIMA  results back into one second
outputs. Our method of doing this was to go back and transform our 20 second window into one
second windows and for each anomaly in our 20 second window , we labeled the entire 20
seconds as an anomaly .
Figur e 12:
ARIMA  anomaly detection model with window
size 80s. Several dane runs were
stitched together .
This graph represents the same results generated in the ARIMA  section but our x-axis now
represents one second windows rather than 20 second windows. Now , using the ensemble logic
described above, our results show that we are able to detect anomalies early on when they occur .
However , we have one false negative where no anomaly appears due to the fact that our ARIMA
model detects the anomalies early on but the MAD model detects the anomalies later , so there is
no overlap for our ensemble logic to agree on an anomaly .
Figur e 13:
Ensemble of the MAD and ARIMA  model. The
two models were combined using the
AND operator with the anomaly prediction from each model as input.
D i s c u s s i o n
A major portion of work that our group was not able to venture into was to generate a
more realistic dataset to test our model on. Our methodology of concatenating multiple runs of
DANE to “simulate” about an hour and a half of network traf fic is not exactly accurate because
we do not know if networks jump back to a steady state as quickly and abruptly as shown in our
dataset. Also, we were only able to train and test our model on one configuration for our steady
state which was a network with a latency of 40 ms and a packet loss ratio of 1/5000. It would
have definitely been interesting to see how our model would perform on a test set with a new
steady state so we can further hypertune our model. For example, the ARIMA  model only uses
“total packets” as its feature and we know from our results from last quarter that dif ferent latency
and packet loss ratios results in dif ferent behavior for total packets sent over the network.
Therefore, the parameters for our ARIMA  model would most likely change if our steady state
changes. As we have it right now , our ARIMA  model is only trained on one configuration so an
addition we would have to make is to continuously or periodically retrain the ARIMA  model to
make sure that it is correctly hypertuned. Moreover , our ensemble logic was very naive and
rough and it would’ve been extremely useful to flush our ensemble model out even further . As
we currently have it, our MAD model is hypertuned to have a window size of 80 seconds while
our ARIMA  model is hypertuned to take in inputs of 20 seconds. The dif ferent inputs of each
model may need the development of dif ferent data pre-processors for each.

Despite advancements in hardware technology, PC users still experience delays when launching applications, which is especially frustrating compared to the near-instantaneous app launches on even low-end smartphones.

The group proposed a solution to preemptively run Windows apps in the background based on user app usage patterns. Their two-step solution involved building telemetry collector modules to gather real-world app usage data from their personal Windows 10 devices and developing neural network models trained on this data to predict app usage times and corresponding launch sequences. They achieved impressive results across different user profiles.

For data collection, they created input libraries in C/C++ using Intel's proprietary XLSDK library and Windows APIs. These libraries included mouse_input.IL, user_wait.IL, foreground_window.IL, and desktop_mapper.IL. They focused on analyzing and forecasting data obtained from the foreground_window input library.

They encountered various challenges throughout the project but were able to successfully collect and verify data after overcoming these obstacles.

For their predictive models, they used Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The HMM was used to identify patterns in app launches based on conditional probabilities of events, while the LSTM was suitable for forecasting problems due to its ability to avoid the vanishing gradient problem.

They achieved high accuracy with their predictive models, indicating that these models could effectively infer daily app usage sequences and durations.

In terms of real-world implications, successfully forecasting app usage behavior means optimizing PC experiences by preemptively launching apps in the background and optimizing system resources like battery and memory—beneficial especially for low-spec Windows machines.

For future plans, they intend to modify their existing foreground window collector for regular time-series logging instead of mouse click burst events. They also plan to tune their desktop mapper collector for more reliable results and enhance their multivariate LSTM with new features for HMMs to make predictions more robust.

To scale up the solution while addressing potential privacy concerns of collecting sensitive information, they propose generating a unique hash for each user's data as a primary key in databases and developing a cloud-based analytics system that streams data to a data lake like S3 using computational resources like EMR and SageMaker for training and inference jobs."

1 ABSTRACT
Our goal for this project was to lower the user wait time when
loading programs by predicting the next used application. In order
to obtain the needed data, we created data collection libraries. Using
this data, we created a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and a Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, but the latter proved to be
better. Using LSTM, we can predict the application use time and
expand this concept to more applications. We created multiple
LSTM models with varying results, but ultimately chose a model
that we think had potential. We decided on using the model that
reported a 90% accuracy.
2 PROBLEM STATEMENT
App wait time is the amount of time an application needs to be
fully loaded. This is depicted as a cursor with a spinning wheel.
The longer this cursor status is present, the longer the user must
wait for the application to be fully loaded and usable. For example,
Google Chrome takes an average of 10 seconds to be fully loaded
up. As a result, user experience may be affected by such wait time.
In an effort to reduce app wait time, we collected data on appli-
cation use and app wait time for a single user over several weeks.
With this data we plan to build a series of models to predict which
application the user will open with an emphasis on when and for
how long. With the series of models, we will evaluate each one and
select the one we think is most fitting.
3 DATA COLLECTION
3.1 Intel Collector
We built upon Intel ®System Usage Report (SUR), which is a frame-
work that will be used to collect our own data for this project. This
was designed to track and manage system usage in an accurate and
efficient way. Intel SUR can be used to run custom input libraries
(IL) to record data as needed. We will be writing custom ILs in order
to collect the data that is needed for our task.
Once started, Intel ®Energy Checker Energy Server (ESRV) will
execute all IL and collect samples every second. If needed, a signal
can be sent to collect samples so that data is only recorded as needed.
Once terminated, the ESRV will stop running and write all of the
data (as specified in the ILs) into a database file. For every instance
that the collector is started, a new database file will be created.
3.2 Foreground Window
Many windows can be layered on top of each other, but only one
window will accept input. This window is known as the Fore-
ground Window , which was the main focus for the IL that we
created. As stated above, it is important to note that the ESRV
will collect samples every second, but a signal can be used instead.
.Knowing this, we decided to collect samples via a foreground win-
dow change. We came to this reasoning because we would end up
with repeating values if the user remains on the same foreground
window; this would be inefficient from a memory perspective and
would make it more difficult to eventually calculate the time spent
on the window. We would also lose data if the user switches fore-
ground windows in less than a second.
We start by obtaining the handle to the foreground window and
checking that the handle is valid. After obtaining the handle, we
obtain the identifier of the thread that created the specified window.
We then enumerate the handle in the case where we are in a child
window and want to obtain the parent window. We must do so
because child windows might return an executable name that does
not match the true executable name. Examples of this are built-
in windows applications (calculator, calendar, weather). Without
enumerating, we get a return of “ApplicationFrameHost” which
does not tell us anything about the executable name. Because of
this, enumerating through the child windows allows us to obtain
the true executable name.
Now that we have the handle to the parent’s window and its
identifier, we use these as parameters to obtain a handle to open this
process. If we have access to this process, we can extract information
from it, such as its file directory. Note that we are not opening this
process with limited access, such that we will not be able to open
processes that demand higher access. We are using limited access
because we do not want to access sensitive information. If we are
in a situation where we do not have access to open a process, we
do not proceed and will simply log the output as “Admin App.”
Now that we have the file directory, we must extract only the
executable name. We want to do this because we do not want to
output the user’s directory, as that can obtain sensitive information.
It’s important to note here that this is simply the directory for the
executable. The executable will always follow this format, followed
by a forward slash and then the actual executable name. In this
case, the full directory will be C:.exe. In C, we can not simply split
by a forward slash and extract the last value. Instead, we must
obtain values (called tokens) for every instance of the forward slash.
We continue to loop through every token until the next token is
NULL. This signifies that there are no more tokens, so we simply
record the last token before the NULL value. This will guarantee
that we obtain the executable name and discard the previous and/or
sensitive information.
As noted above, we record only when a foreground window has
changed. As such, we have a variable that holds the previous exe-
cutable name. Before collecting the value as a sample, we compare
the previous executable name to the current one. This is because
an application can have the same name, but have different process
identifiers and are distinct. This can happen when an application
has the ability to open up different and smaller windows, but are
still connected to the main framework. The executable ‘steam.exe’, , Scott, Do, Tran
is an example because steam has smaller windows implemented,
such as friends, community, trading, etc. These all will have the
same parent window (steam) but will have different process identi-
fiers. Since it has different identifiers, the ESRV will collect and log
‘steam.exe’ multiple times in a rapid succession. We want to avoid
this situation because it can lead to a skewed dataset which means
that our machine learning model will be less accurate. However,
the use of comparing the previous executable name and the current
executable name ensures that we will not run into this issue and
will always log distinct values.
4 DATASET
4.1 Data Overview
Using the data collector and input library we developed, we gath-
ered just about 2 months worth of data from our group’s Windows
10 laptop from December 1st 2021 to January 30th 2022 over 63
collection periods. We collected foreground windows as ‘VALUE’
and recording time as ‘MEASUREMENT_TIME’. In total 68 unique
applications were recorded with the most used app being Chrome.
Figure 1: A bar chart showing the most used apps in hours.
This gave us 2469 rows or foreground windows collected. This
totals to about 66 hours of total active use time.
4.2 Data Cleaning
The data collector stores everything it collects into databases and
separates the data into tables by data types.To extract the fore-
ground window information we wrote a simple SQL query to get
all the rows for the string table. This was then converted into a
Pandas DataFrame and each column was changed into the correct
data type as this information could be lost during conversion. Each
collection session has its own database, so we did this for every
session. After every DataFrame was checked for errors, they were
merged into a larger database we would use going forward.
‘MEASUREMENT_TIME’ values were recorded in military time
so we initially didn’t notice errors with this metric. However after
beginning to see strange late night activity, we looked at the data-
base files and found an inconsistency with the time the database
was created and the last recording time, values that should differ
by only milliseconds. Instead of using PST, our collector was using
UTC and we subsequently had incorrect values. This was fixed by
Figure 2: A line chart plotting active use over the entire data
collection period.
querying the metadata table in each database to see the actual col-
lection start time in both time zones. The difference was calculated
and added subtracted from ‘MEASUREMENT_TIME’ values in the
related data.
Outliers were found after looking at the amount of time various
apps were used and the unique lists of apps. Using the difference
in time recorded between apps we calculated the use time for each
foreground window in our dataset. Very quickly, apps we were not
expecting had a total use time much higher than expected. Both File
Explorer and Microsoft Edge had instances where they were open
for an unreasonable amount of time, which was likely the machine
being left on unattended. While we do believe that these instances
were not due to collector malfunction, they were removed given that
their inclusion in a model could lead to unrealistic predictions based
on their massive scale. We also found that in some cases the same
app would have multiple names. We found both ‘Steam.exe’ and
‘steam.exe’ in our dataset and converted all app names to lowercase
so future models would interpret them as the same.
5 MODELS
5.1 HMM
The first approach we tried was predicting a sequence of apps
given a starting app. This would enable an underlying program
to launch the predicted app in the background and decrease the
wait of opening it for the user. A Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
was developed for this prediction task. HMMs are statistical models
that predict sequences using conditional probability, that being the
odds that one event will occur given prior knowledge of another.
This means that HMMs require a clear and consistent start from
which all sequences start at. The HMM can visually be displayed
as a decision tree, where each branch is selected based on which
has the highest probability.
For our problem we built a first order HMM, the order here refers
to how much recent history is used to make individual predictions.Predicting Application Use to Reduce User Wait Time
Figure 3: Transition Diagram for the HMM using 5 common
apps.
In a first order HMM, while conditional probabilities are calculated
using all the training data, it’s the conditional probability based
on 1 previous event. In our case that means the model knows the
probability of opening Chrome given Zoom was just opened but
not Chrome given two or more previous apps. While this gives
the model less data, it’s much more resource efficient which is
important for the eventual application. First we added a ‘s0’ app
to start off each data collection period so our model could see the
probability of opening each app first. The data was then split into
training and test sets with 80% of observed app pairs being used for
training and 20% for testing. Training consisted of creating a (n x
n) transition matrix where n is the number of apps in the training
set. For a position of the matrix (A, B) it contains the conditional
probability of opening app A given app B calculated by:
𝑃(𝐴|𝐵)=𝑃(𝐴∩𝐵)/𝑃(𝐵) (1)
These probabilities were further verified by making sure the
rows of the transition matrix summed to 1 as that would represent
all possibilities of A.
Using this matrix the model would predict a sequence of apps
given a desired sequence length and starting app which defaulted
to ‘s0’. Ultimately when predicting just the following app, so a
sequence of 2, the model had an accuracy of only 17%. This is due
to several factors. Firstly, the data was unbalanced. The user spent
a disproportionate amount of time using a small sample of apps, so
those used most would be predicted much more than they actually
appeared in the data. There also was low dimensionality so the
model had less history to work with and was essentially forgetful,
therefore it needed to have more past data to accurately predict for
our dataset. Lastly, for this approach we had too many apps. With
over 50 apps there aren’t a lot of possible predictions with unequal
amounts of data. This made us consider lowering our scope to one
app at a time.
5.2 LSTM
Understanding we would likely need to narrow our focus and in-
crease memory retention in our model to improve results, we moved
on to our second approach. This time we predicted the use time of
a single app within a given hour. This would allow a user to haveapps preloaded as well but would require more models (one for
each app) at the benefit of more accurate predictions. A Long Short
Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM RNN) was used
in this problem. The LSTM in the name refers to a cell type in the
network that improves accuracy by strengthening long-term and
working memory. This type of model is a great predictor for time
series problems because of how it learns from the entire training
series, rather than pairs, for predictions.
Before creating our LSTM, we first had to encode our data in
such a way that the model can use it as inputs. Our initial approach
was to bin the use time by hour in each row, and to measure the
seconds in each hour Google Chrome was used. We chose to analyze
Google Chrome because this was our most used app, thus having
the most data. This means that we will get a larger dataset if we
were to filter the dataset with only one application. Our other apps
did not have sufficient data to be used in this model. Our Google
Chrome dataset had 2 features, with the columns being USE_TIME,
the use time for Google Chrome in seconds during the hour, and
on break, a feature that denotes whether the user was using the
machine during a time that school was not in session. The rows
in this dataset were split by the hour, ranging from the first hour
when data was successfully recorded to the last hour that the ESRV
was running.

A high accuracy was achieved with our LSTM (specifically 96%)
but after further investigation, this was because of the model pre-
dicting only one value. Since most of the use times within our data
were 0s, it made sense on why the model only predicted one value.
The LSTM did not capture the peaks and we were not sure why
this was happening. We wanted to build upon this prototype, and
make it as best as we can.
Before making any major changes to our model, specifically the
encoding of our data, we opted to look at our accuracy metric and
adjust the hyperparameters of our model. After looking into how
our model dealt with accuracy, we discovered that our model was
overestimating in order to achieve a high score in that category. This
was not what we wanted as an indicator as to how good our model
was doing, as estimating an exact use time in our use case would
be extremely hard. Instead, we opted to create our own accuracy
metric, which instead would use a range instead of an exact value.
True would only be returned, given that the predicted value landed
in a range relative to the actual value. The default range was ±.5 *
the actual value, but this was easily adjustable from the parameters
of the function. We also noticed that some models would predict
very small values for 0 that would vary every time the model was
re-trained. From a human eye it was clear these functioned as 0’s as, , Scott, Do, Tran
Figure 5: Base model performance
they would be consistent with the zeroes in our data. To make sure
our accuracy metric captured this, the outputs would be subtracted
by that model’s zero value.
Next, we looked into the hyperparameters of the model and
tinkered with them until we got a result that we were satisfied with.
One hyperparameter was focused at a time, with each one being
manually changed to achieve best performance. We adjusted one
hyperparameter until it could not get any better, then moved on
to the next one. Our edited hyperparameters were with 5 layers, a
batch size of 2, and a lookback value of 3. We then incorporated a
new method when dealing with the last two hyperparameters, the
loss function and optimizer. Since these two hyperparameters had
a finite amount of choices, we ran them in a nested for loop to see
which combination of the two gave us the best choice. 56 models
were run, and the results of 5 are listed in the table below.
Figure 6: Example of 5 results
As you can see, the results varied a lot and we couldn’t tell which
of the models did the best. We first took a look at the combinations
with a 96% or higher accuracy calculated using the model’s function.
Despite their accuracy being good, we were still skeptical of the
high values and started looking at them through our own accuracy
metric. Even with this new perspective, results still varied and
there was still a lot of overestimation. Our next step was to review
these models visually, and the best one to us was the one with the
logcosh loss function and the NAdam optimizer. Not only did it
boast a 90% accuracy with our own function, this model actually
tried to capture some of the peaks within our dataset, and did not
fall back to overestimating the predictions. This was our best model
yet, and it resembled the dataset even more than the previous one
did. We still wanted to further optimize this model, and turned to
changing the encoding of our dataset.
Figure 7: Performance of logcosh and NAdam model
Since the previous LSTM only had 2 input columns with our
dataset, our next goal was to add more features for the model to
use. Instead of having just 2 features, we revised it to have 24,
which represented the seconds used in an hour of the day. We had
an additional 25th label column which showed the total seconds
Google Chrome was used in a 24 hour instance. For our rows, each
one represented a day in which data was recorded. In total, we had
61 rows worth of data, and 24 columns as inputs.
Figure 8: New encoding
With our new encoding, we were ready to run the model and see
our results. Unfortunately, we had to change much of our previous
code on how we ran the model and graphed it, as it was catered
to our 2 feature dataset. This took more time than expected, so
most default hyperparameters were used, with the loss function
being mean squared error and the optimizer being Adam. The only
change we made to the hyperparameters was changing epochs to
400, as this model took longer for the loss to converge.
As you can see here, our new inputs did not perform as we
wanted it to, and actually resulted in a worse accuracy than our
previous model. This one ended with an accuracy of 33%, which was
67% lower than our previous model. Despite our best attempts, this
was the end result of our last modification given our allotted time.
However, we were not discouraged by this result, as visually, you
can see how this model tried harder to capture peaks and prevent
overestimating. Many more ideas were thought of to improve our
model and finally reach our end goal in the near future.Predicting Application Use to Reduce User Wait Time

6 DISCUSSION
6.1 Limitations
During the initial state of data collection, we ran into multiple
obstacles that we had to overcome. First of all, we did not perfect
our other input library (Desktop Mapper) for it to collect other
metrics in relation to the foreground window. Before starting the
data collection period, we only ended up with just using one input
library to record the foreground window executable and its use
time. To make matters worse, we only had one laptop to record
data off of, which required the user to be constantly be using this
machine, thus hindering the amount of data we have. Instead of
crippling ourselves and using only those metrics for our model,
we expanded upon it and added more features for the model to be
trained on. ON_BREAK is an example of a feature we added that
was not part of the data collection process. We insisted on adding
this to explain the big spikes in our data, in which it definitely
improved our results. We also tried modifying the dataset in a way
that resulted in multiple features, as seen in our last optimization
which included 25 columns instead of the original 2.
Our biggest struggle was with coding in the language of C. Our
group was not comfortable coding in C, as all of us were only
accustomed to mainly doing things in Python. However, we took a
different perspective on this, and saw it as a challenge we had to
overcome. We saw this as an opportunity to get better at coding in
C, and to also learn the intricacies of the language since this was
opted over Python. C had to be utilized in such a way that while
collecting data, the user was unobstructed and that their privacy
was not at risk. Because of these two factors, we were limited on
how much of the user’s data we could access. Using resources such
as SUR and ESRV documentation, we managed to create a data
collector with the use of C and Intel libraries, while keeping in
mind the memory usage and privacy.
6.2 Future Plans
Despite so much progress on this project, there is actually much
more that we can do to finally reach our end goal of predicting a
user’s next open app and preloading it in the background. First ofall, we can add more features to our data collector by creating and
finishing up more input libraries. With this new information, we
can feed more information to our model, thus resulting in more
features and potentially better predictions. Once we get the model
to a point we are comfortable with, the LSTM can be expanded
upon just predicting just one app, and predict use time for multiple
apps in the same timeframe. This can lead us into also predicting
the next app opened, which is essential to what our original goal
is, to preload apps. And finally, we can get to the point where we
actually preload the app and improve the user’s experience on their
machine.
6.3 Conclusion
To conclude, we were able to construct a data collector using the
Intel®System Usage Report and our own input libraries to collect
the foreground data of a user’s machine without slowdown. With
this data, a LSTM model was created and used to predict the use
time of the app Google Chrome with moderate accuracy. Our goal of
predicting the next application that would be used was not reached,
but upon expanding on this model and its features, this could be
worked up to.","The goal of this project was to reduce user wait time when loading programs by predicting the next used application. The researchers created data collection libraries and used the data to create a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The LSTM model proved to be better and achieved 90% accuracy. The researchers collected data on application use and wait time for a single user over several weeks. They built multiple LSTM models with varying results and ultimately chose a model with potential. The dataset consisted of 68 unique applications and 2469 rows of foreground windows collected. The researchers cleaned the data by converting it into a Pandas DataFrame and merged it into a larger database. They also found outliers in the data and removed them. The HMM approach predicted sequences of apps given a starting app but had low accuracy due to unbalanced data and low dimensionality. The LSTM approach predicted the use time of a single app within an hour and achieved 96% accuracy, but overestimated values. The researchers adjusted hyperparameters and created their own accuracy metric to improve the model's performance. They also tried different encoding methods for the dataset but did not achieve better results. Despite the limitations, such as limited access to user data, coding challenges, and unobstructed user experience, the researchers have future plans to add more features, expand the LSTM model, predict multiple apps in the same timeframe, preload apps, and improve user experience on their machines."

.technology, computer users are often faced with the dreaded
spinning icon waiting for an application to load. Building
upon our previous work developing data collectors with the
Intel System Usage Reporting (SUR) SDK, we introduce IN-
TELli next, a comprehensive solution for next-app prediction
for application preload to improve perceived system fluidity.
We develop a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for prediction
of the k most likely next apps, achieving an accuracy of 70%
when k = 3. We then implement a long short-term memory
(LSTM) model to predict the total duration that applications
will be used. After hyperparameter optimization leading to
an optimal lookback value of 5 previous applications, we are
able to predict the usage time of a given application with a
mean absolute error of 45 seconds. Our work constitutes a
promising comprehensive application preload solution with
data collection based on the Intel SUR SDK and prediction
with machine learning.HDSI Intel Capstone ’21, Jan 3–March 19, 2022, San Diego, CA Gorlla et al.
2 Introduction
Users often face a myriad of minuscule slow-downs when
navigating a computer. These slow-downs largely take the
form of application loading times and we aimed to first collect
user data by building custom data collectors in our previ-
ous work. The collected data can then be used to study user
patterns and to extract insights via machine learning prac-
tices and models such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Models. By leveraging
these models, the inconvenience of accumulated application
start-up times can be greatly reduced.
Despite computer processor speeds increasing year after
year, there are still high usage programs and processes that
interrupt workflows in our daily lives. Whether that inter-
ruption be lag when opening Zoom to join a meeting, or
waiting for Google Chrome to open a link embedded in a
Word document, these micro (or in some cases, major) stut-
ters can cause a process meant to be relatively smooth to
be a large source of frustration in the daily lives of an end
user. One key point, however, is that these processes are
actually often “scheduled” in a sense. That is, most people
often repeat the same or similar tasks every day, and have
a set routine. One example could be an office worker who
opens Microsoft Excel almost every time they turns on their
laptop at the office. These sorts of patterns can be studied,
and by using machine learning, we can create predetermined
schedules for users, allowing us to preload apps, or have pro-
cesses ready before the user needs them. In other words, by
analyzing user behavior, we can load an application the user
would likely use next in advance, reducing wait and loading
times.
By using Intel’s System Usage Reporting library and the
accompanying XLSDK, we created “monitors” of user and
computer activity, known as collectors or Input Libraries,
and create activity logs which we can then analyze to provide
preloading solutions for the user. In our previous work, we
have covered the development of these Input Libraries. We
now briefly restate their descriptions.
In order for us to create our own Input Libraries, the
XLSDK provides a wide range of examples which can be
used either as references or templates. Throughout the first
ten weeks of working with Intel, we developed four dif-
ferent Input Libraries, each using a different template and
measuring different categories of inputs from the user and
computer. The first, the mouse_input Input Library, keeps a
log of the cursor coordinates as the user moves the mouse
around. Second, the user_waiting Input Library, keeps a
timer based log of the cursor icon as the user uses the com-
puter. The third, a foreground_window Input Library, cre-
ates a log entry whenever the foreground window (the win-
dow in front of all other windows) changes whether it be
automatically (such as a notification pop up) or by user input
(clicking the taskbar). Finally, the fourth Input Library is thedesktop_mapper , which, when triggered by a change in the
foreground window, maps all the windows on the desktop in
z-order and stores pertinent information about each window
e.g. position and size. Each of these Input Libraries are coded
differently in fundamental ways, and measure changes in dif-
ferent ways as well. By using the data provided by Libraries
like these, we can determine preloading schedules for the
individual user.
3 Methods
3.1 Data Collection & Preliminary Analysis
With our Input Libraries fully functional, they were continu-
ously run on two computers (identified by the IDs LAPTOP
and DESKTOP ) over the course of three months, from No-
vember 2021 to February 2022. The users were advised to
continue operating the machine according to their regular
schedules to ensure that the following analysis would best
generate insights on naturally occurring user patterns. In
total, the Input Libraries collected over 160,000 rows of raw
data in 76 database ( .db) files from the two machines. Thanks
to our extensive data validation process we built in the first
half of the project, the data cleanup needed was minimal.
These processes include functions to check for appropriate
data types, improbable values (such as negative mouse X
and Y coordinates), and null values. As a result, the manual
work required mainly consisted of column renaming and
other simple DataFrame manipulations. After extracting just
the foreground process information, we were left with two
datasets with 5,241 and 10,113 rows respectively.
We found that each computer had separate periods of high
and low usage, with general boundaries around Fall Quarter
2021, Winter Break 2021/2022, and Winter Quarter 2022.
Because of the higher consistency of data of some periods
depending on the machine, we used data before December
10, 2021 for the laptop and we used data after January 7, 2022
for the desktop.
Some trends in the data can be seen in the exploratory
plots below. For instance, Chrome was the most common
application in the dataset followed by Windows Explorer
for both datasets, but the trends differ after those. We found
that each computer had separate periods of high and low
usage, with general boundaries around Fall Quarter 2021,
Winter Break 2021/2022, and Winter Quarter 2022. Because

We addressed two predictive tasks using the data collected.
For our first task, we built models to predict the next applica-
tion used based on previous user activity. For our second task,
we built a model to predict the duration the next application
would be used based on previous user activity.
3.2.1 Task 1. Approach 1. Next-App Prediction: Hidden
Markov Model
The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a particular machine
learning approach that ingests sequences of time-related
events in order to predict future events. For our purposes,
we manually implemented a First Order HMM (adopting a
similar model class as the package, scikit-learn) which looks
at a single previous application in order to predict the single
next application. A HMM’s “order” refers to the amount of
previous applications, or “look-back”, the HMM will use in
order to generate a single next prediction, and therefore, our
First Order HMM will use a single previous event to predict
a single next event. This is equivalent to simply computing
conditional probabilities of each unique 2 sequence event; for
a given previous event A, the probability of the next event B
is determined by:
𝑃(𝐵|𝐴)=𝑃(𝐵∩𝐴)
𝑃(𝐴)(1)
These probabilistic values are calculated upon model train-
ing and stored into a posterior matrix instance variable.
These probabilities are then recalled upon prediction.
Given an input foreground of notepad++.exe , for exam-
ple, the probability of explorer.exe being the next fore-
ground is approximately 43% as shown in Figure 4. One
special implementation of our First Order HMM is the cus-
tom predict function which has an optional parameter of
n_foregrounds which specifies the number of foregrounds
to return for a single input, based on the foregrounds with the
highest probabilities. When viewing Figure 4 yet again, a pre-
dict with n_foregrounds = 3 will return the list [‘explorer.exe’,
‘mmc.exe’, ‘chrome.exe’] . Accuracy for a single obser-
vation is therefore calculated by determining whether or not
the true foreground application exists within the list of pre-
dicted foreground applications. Using n_foregrounds = 3
for our testing dataset, we achieve a final accuracy of 70.05%.
3.2.2 Task 1. Approach 2. Next-App Prediction: Long
Short-Term Memory
Though our Hidden Markov Model implementation was
fairly successful, we wanted to approach the task from a
different angle, so we built a Long Short-Term Memory Re-
current Neural Network (LSTM RNN) model as well. Because
of the higher complexity of LSTMs compared to HMMs, we
developed our model using Keras, a deep learning API built
on Python that allows for a streamlined pipeline of modelHDSI Intel Capstone ’21, Jan 3–March 19, 2022, San Diego, CA Gorlla et al.
creation. By using Keras, we could manipulate various val-
ues quickly and easily, allowing us to test many variations
of the models in a short period of time, without having to
rewrite any significant part of the code. Keras also contains
many preprocessing and testing functions that allow us to
prepare our data and test the model accuracy easily. We de-
cided on a RNN model because RNNs are a type of neural
network that uses previous inputs to make new predictions.
This was perfect for our case, as our data is time based, and
we were trying to make future predictions based on past
actions. Furthermore, out of the many implementations of
RNNs, we decided it was best to use a Long Short-Term Mem-
ory (LSTM) model. This is because LSTM models are more
tailored to situations where the durations between events
vary. In our case, the durations between each foreground ap-
plication switch were different, meaning that the timestamps
of each point of data were spread unevenly.
Figure 5. LSTM cell (Source: Christopher Olah)
In order to use our data to create the model, we first needed
to process it into the correct format so Keras could read it in.
First, we needed to select the features to use for our model. In
other words, the model would use these properties to make
the prediction. We used the time of foreground change, the
previous application used, and the time the user spent on
the previous application right before the foreground window
change. Even with the features selected, however, we had to
do further preprocessing to make the data usable. First, we
extracted just the hour out of the timestamp. This is because
we wanted to see if app usage depended on time of day, and
removing non-repeating elements (such as month and day)
and removing elements too minute (such as minutes and
seconds) seemed appropriate. Second, we one-hot encoded
the previous application used. As we found that some of
the applications found in the dataset only appeared once or
twice (installers, for example), we found the top ten most
used applications, and renamed the rest to “Other”. Though
initially we did not do this, after multiple rounds of testing
we found that removing the lower outliers improved our
model accuracy tremendously. Finally, we created the outputcolumn by shifting the application name column by one.
After preprocessing, we split the data into a 70:30 ratio, in
which 70% of the data was used for training, and 30% was
used for testing. The training dataset was used to create
the LSTM model in Keras. Our final model consisted of four
layers; an LSTM layer, a dropout layer, another LSTM layer,
and a dense layer with a softmax activation function. Thanks
to the flexibility and ease of use of Keras layers, we were able
to experiment with various configurations, and we found that
using the ADAM optimizer, the categorical cross-entropy
loss function, and 100 epochs created a fairly accurate model
of our training set.

our LSTM returned a list of the top four most likely applica-
tions to follow the current foreground application, ordered in
levels of confidence. Accuracy was calculated with the same
function (where a single observation was labeled accurate if
the true future foreground application appeared in the list of
predictions). Our LSTM model had a test accuracy of 68.60%,
a value similar to our HMM accuracy.LSTM and HMMs for Next-App Prediction HDSI Intel Capstone ’21, Jan 3–March 19, 2022, San Diego, CA
3.2.3 Task 2. Next-App Duration Prediction: Long Short-
Term Memory
Figure 6. LSTM duration prediction modelBecause of the flexibility of the LSTM model, we decided
to focus on a LSTM solution for task 2, predicting next-
application durations, as well. Our task 1 LSTM model used
a “look-back” value of one previous foreground application
in order to predict one future foreground application, where
a “look-back” is defined as the number of previous events a
single input will use in order to generate the next output. In
order to raise accuracy, our task 2 LSTM used a look-back
value of five. In other words, the model uses the previous five
data points to predict the next. The task 2 model architecture
is similar to our task 1 model, with the four layers in the
same order. However, we used a MAE loss function, ReLU
activation function, and 25 epochs instead. After training,
our model made predictions with a mean absolute error of
0.74 minutes. With our testing dataset’s mean foreground
duration of 1.73 minutes, on average our model predicted
foreground durations accurate within approximately 44 sec-
onds.

4 Results
Our project addressed two predictive tasks: (1) next-app pre-
diction and (2) next-app duration prediction. Task 1 was
explored via two machine learning models with our First
Order Hidden Markov Model yielding an accuracy of 70.05%
using a prediction list of three and our Long Short-Term
Memory Model yielding an accuracy of 68.60% using a pre-
diction list of four. Task 2 was explored through a single
Long Short-Term Memory Model with an average error rate
of 42.77%, or 44.4 seconds.
5 Conclusion
Developing a data science project from start to finish has
certainly been a great challenge and learning experience. By
leveraging C programming to custom code data collectors,HDSI Intel Capstone ’21, Jan 3–March 19, 2022, San Diego, CA Gorlla et al.
we were able to efficiently collect user data while minimizing
extraneous information gathering. Additionally, we have
grown to accept primary data sourcing as an essential aspect
of machine learning practices; striving towards becoming
a full-stack data scientist will reap benefits by giving one a
greater, holistic view of all stages of a data science pipeline.
Although we have successfully solved our two project
tasks of (1) next-app prediction and (2) next-app duration
prediction, there exists improvements in several realms. Our
original HMM was based on a First Order HMM, and there-
fore, only used single, previous applications to predict future
applications. By spending more time working towards a Sec-
ond, Third, or higher Order HMM, we can hope to achieve
greater model performance. Additionally during our data
collection phase, there was heavy overlap of distinct timeperiods, such as Fall Quarter 2021, Winter Break, and Win-
ter Quarter 2022 (based on a college quarter system). In
the future, we may aim to clearly demarcate data collec-
tion boundaries to ensure quality data that is independent
from each distinct time period. Our project work does not
stop here: with the aforementioned model performances
for our (classification-based) next-app prediction task and
(regression-based) next-app duration prediction task, we
hope to implement our data science work for other relevant
applications. These other applications include mobile device
machine learning, cloud machine learning, and repurposing
of obsolete hardware.

Abstract
The online marketplace and escrow system show great potential to be incorporated with and
benefit tremendously from emerging blockchain technology. Our project focus on creating a
decentralized, blockchain-based online marketplace that provides similar online transaction and shopping
experiences for users while guaranteeing high degrees of user anonymity and autonomy. Building upon
the smart contract for the peer-to-peer transactions we created in Quarter 1, we established a
ready-to-launch website as the frontend client to deliver to users and added more comprehensive
functionalities to the contract, together creating a marketing system that enables automated transactions
between multiple users. The system will have advantages such as high user anonymity, reliable
transaction without third-party interventions, accessible transaction histories, and a usable interface that
accommodates different actions. We divided our task into parallel groups to design and collectively
develop the website. The frontends’ focus was the webpage design, which should transform our contract
into an actual usable product. We created UI and visual elements to facilitate navigation experiences and
build the connection between the website, the underlying smart contract, and all external resources
necessary for blockchain transactions. The backends’ primary goal was to create the advanced
functionalities of the transaction system and multiple utility functionalities for the website. We developed
the smart contracts through Remix IDE and deployed the contracts on the Goerli Ethereum testnet to
eventually run as a holistic system.Introduction
Blockchain technologies have undergone rapid expansion in years with the potential to be
incorporated into many current applications and frameworks of the IT industry. Conventional software
and website services are facing challenges as Blockchain-based systems provide an unparalleled degree of
information reliability and integrity, and allow services to be made available without a trusted third-party
provider. One of these industries in which blockchain technology has shown immense potential to reform
is the online marketplace and escrow system. Currently, online marketplace services, such as Amazon and
eBay, are predominantly offered by third-party corporations that gain profits from high service fees and
are vulnerable to user data breaches.
A decentralized, Ethereum-based escrow system on the other hand requires negligible operational
fees (i.e. gas fees) instead of a substantial portion of the seller’s profits. Trusted third-party firms such as
eBay were critical prior to blockchain technology since they address the issue of trust between unknown
buyers and sellers as a mediator in a digital marketplace. However, with the open-sourced smart contracts
of blockchains, new escrow systems can effectively displace third-party administrators and proceed with
transactions based on transparent, mutually agreed protocols.
To explore alternative escrow system approaches, we aim to establish a decentralized,
Ethereum-based escrow marketplace by creating a smart contract that adapts online transactions with
Blockchain technology and building a full-stack escrow system. Eventually, the escrow system is
expected to prompt the users to connect to Ethereum, interact with the smart contract, and accomplish
automated, peer-to-peer transactions with other users (e.g. buyers and sellers). We design our smart
contracts to allow buyers and sellers to interact through actions such as posting products to sell, buying
products, canceling transactions, and sending confirmations at each step. Our smart contract will securely
hold funds until the item is received by the buyer and all conditions of the smart contract are met. All
steps will be automated to eliminate external mediators. Thereafter, we will design the front end to build
connections between the smart contract, the cryptocurrency wallets (e.g. MetaMask), and the
user-learnable, actionable interface.Specifically, we divided our task into two parallel portions, the front-end escrow client building,
and the back-end smart contract development. The front end will focus on creating UI and visual elements
to facilitate navigation experiences. We host our escrow system through an online website, where users
will be prompted to connect to their MetaMask wallets and interact with the smart contract to join,
confirm, and cancel transactions. The content of the backend is based on the smart contract from the
previous quarter, in which the team worked to create the additional functionalities of the website to
replicate the user actions available on conventional online marketplace websites nowadays and make our
prototype competitive. The team also devoted time to testing edge cases and compatibility between the
contract and the front-end website.Methods
General Overview
Our objective is to establish an e-commerce platform that is powered by blockchain technology,
specifically Ethereum, to enable completely decentralized buying and selling of products between sellers
and buyers. To ensure that the sale of a product is successful, we require both parties to have the incentive
to complete the purchase. As a decentralized platform, we lack a mediator to establish trust between
unknown buyers and sellers in a digital marketplace. Therefore, to guarantee the effectiveness of a
product purchase, both the seller and the buyer will have to deposit the value of the product price as
escrow in the smart contract. This deposit will not be accessible to either party until the transaction is
completed or one of the parties cancels the operation.
Consequently, when a seller sells a product, they will need to deposit the price of the product for
sale, regardless of the quantity sold. On the other hand, the buyer will have to deposit twice the price of
the product value, where one-half will be used as escrow, and the other half will be transferred to the
seller as a payment method at the end of the operation. After the transaction is complete, the seller will
receive twice the price of the product (their escrow and the buyer’s payment), while the buyer will receive
their escrow back and the product.
Furthermore, our development includes additional functionalities to provide both sellers and
buyers with more freedom when making purchases, similar to those found on platforms like eBay. These
functionalities include the ability for sellers and buyers to cancel transactions, either by rejecting the
buyer or canceling the purchase, as well as the ability for sellers to retrieve a product from the platform.
Additionally, we have added the capability for buyers to add reviews once the transaction has been
completed.
To develop a decentralized platform, the logic of the code is the governing entity that establishes
the rules for the platform. For this reason, certain functions can only be applied under specific conditions.
Furthermore, the timeline for a purchase follows a strict structure to prevent fraudulent transactions. Thisstructure is illustrated in the following flowchart (see Figure 1), which shows the logic behind our
platform and the conditions under which certain operations can be carried out.

Backend
The objective of the backend of our project is to provide advanced functionalities for the
transaction system and multiple utility features for the website. This was achieved by developing a smart
contract using Solidity and the Remix IDE, which was later deployed on the Goerli Ethereum testnet
using ThirdWeb. It is designed to enable buyers and sellers to interact through different actions such as
posting products for
Initially, we started developing a contract that created a sub-contract for every transaction
between seller and buyer, however, this was deemed ineffective due to high gas fees for each transaction.
To solve this issue, we adapted the contract to allow multiple sellers and buyers to transact under the same
single contract. We achieved this by utilizing mapping, arrays, and structs to keep track of all current and
past transactions and states in our smart contract.
The smart contract includes several functions that can be divided into two categories: 'public'
functions and 'public view' functions. Although both functions can be called both inside and outside the
smart contract, the first type allows modifying the state of the contract, while the second type only allows
reading the state of the contract. We use the first type of functions to ensure the proper functioning of our
e-commerce platform, such as createProduct (seller), buyProduct (buyer), approvePurchase (seller),
rejectPurchase (seller), approveReceipt (buyer), cancelBuy (buyer), stopProduct (seller), addRating
(buyer). These functions are visible in the flowchart in Figure 1.
To ensure that both buyers and sellers can see the products for sale on our platform and confirm
each step of the purchase process, we need view functions that allow access to the information of the
contract, without any cost to the user (zero gas fees). These functions are: getAllProducts, getStatus,
observeBuyers, getDeliveryAddress, and their names indicate the function they perform.
Finally, we have integrated the correct functioning of IFPS into our smart contract to be able to
visualize the images of each product uploaded by the seller. We have made certain modifications to our
contract to be able to store the content-addressed hash and ensure that all images are stored in a
decentralized manner.Frontend
The frontend of our project focuses on creating a webpage to display to users and allow users to
connect to and interact with the underlying smart contract and escrow system through simple,
discoverable interfaces. The website serves as a central hub that facilitates communication between the
users and provides an easy way for users to connect to the various tools and applications (e.g. MetaMask,
Etherscan, etc) essential for blockchain operations. To provide a fluent, comfortable navigation
experience for the users, the frontend website design is mainly concerned with two demands: the stable,
efficient connection to the contract and external tools, and the discoverability and aesthetic of the visual
elements.
We started the design process of the wireframe by creating a wireframe using Figma, in which we
build the general layout of the various pages and preserved dummy buttons to add functionalities in the
future. We used wireframes mainly to test out the placement of the website logo, buttons, and the visual
representation of text and products. The wireframe provided a framework for the actual website
development.
The frontend web page is built upon Javascript with relevant libraries and tools (e.g. React and
Vite). We also added elements with Tailwind CSS to achieve better visuality and interactivity of the
website. Furthermore, we also utilized certain blockchain specific applications to enhance usability and
data retrieval efficiency, such as Thirdweb SDK and IPFS. The frontend code is hosted on Hostinger, and
we have used a paid dedicated gateway to accelerate the necessary IPFS functionalities. Version control
for the frontend code is managed on GitHub.
The frontend website requires users to sign in to their MetaMask as login, for which buttons are
provided as the utility navigation to guide the users to their browser extensions and sign in to the
cryptocurrency wallet. The main navigation of the website after signing in comprises connection status to
the wallet, a display of currently available products (like typical online shopping websites), and actionable
buttons for current transactions.Results

With the development of this platform, we have observed how to develop a dApp from start to
finish. Likewise, we have seen how blockchain technology offers considerable benefits that position
Escryptow as a possible alternative to more common platforms such as Ebay. However, with this project,
we have also observed that an e-commerce dApp also has certain disadvantages compared to centralized
platforms.
The main benefits of our platform, Escryptow, are the elimination of intermediaries and third
parties for the buying and selling of products. Thanks to the logic of our smart contract and the interface
created around it, both buyers and sellers can buy and sell products without any companies or banks in
between. It is a particularly attractive alternative if certain institutions require high transaction fees for the
sale of products. With Escryptow, the user only has to worry about gas fees.In addition, our platform also
offers more security when processing payments. Finally, the fact that all transactions are accessible and
recorded in the blockchain offers more transparency and accountability for the parties involved. As we
can see, Escryptow offers numerous benefits compared to centralized platforms.
However, it is also important to mention certain disadvantages that would need to be addressed
for Escryptow (or a similar platform) to compete against Ebay. Firstly, the scalability of the platform
could be a problem if the number of users were to grow significantly. If this were the case, the smart
contract may struggle with large volumes of data that would hinder the platform's operation. However,
thanks to the fact that we have decided to use IFPS, this problem is also of lesser importance. Similarly,
another problem to investigate and solve is the fact of paying gas fees during each operation necessary
during the purchase (even during the cancellation of products). Users who cancel or are rejected will have
paid gas fees without being able to successfully complete the purchase. However, it is important to note
that gas fees are minimal and lower than transaction fees on centralized platforms. Finally, the last
problem with Escryptow is data privacy. We must keep in mind that our platform is used to sell physical
products, so the security and protection of delivery addresses must be guaranteed. Although it is true thatEscryptow does not protect this information, there are different existing ways to make it possible and
maintain end-to-end encryption of sensitive information.
Escrytow is a promising platform and project for the emergence of decentralized commerce
platforms that can handle a large number of users. However, it is important to note that certain tasks still
need to be addressed for it to become a reality. The process of creating a dApp from scratch has been a
rewarding one, and we hope it will open the door to future innovations in the field of decentralized
applications.Appendix

1   Abstract
The online marketplace and escrow system stand to
benefit tremendously from
blockchain technology and decentralization. Such systems save transactors money , minimize
privacy risks, and give users control over their transactions, rather than relying on often
unreliable, restrictive, and expensive third-party platforms. For these reasons, we implement a
decentralized, Ethereum-based escrow marketplace that provides a setting for untrusted parties to
initiate transactions without authority-bearing third-party arbiters in order to maintain anonymity ,
transaction integrity , and transparency . With blockchain technology , we are able to leverage
smart contracts and use Ether to ensure that both parties remain compliant with their agreement,
while also minimizing many of the aforementioned risks and costs of traditional third-party
platforms. By implementing smart contracts through the Remix IDE and deploying them to an
Ethereum network, and with the use of cryptocurrency wallets such as MetaMask, we are able to
run transactions anonymously and securely store them on the Ethereum blockchain. This
protocol creates a strong monetary incentive for both parties to go ahead with their transaction,
while also keeping their transaction private and secure. More specifically , our smart contract
allows one seller to sell items to any quantity of buyers at once. Moreover , using Javascript,
HTML, and CSS, we designed and built a website that serves as the front end of our smart
contract, so that users don’ t have to interact on Etherscan, which requires some knowledge of the
programming language Solidity . Simply put, we are providing a layer of abstraction for all
1parties while also simplifying the process for them. Thus, the website can serve as a
decentralized e-commerce application, where sellers and buyers can use their Metamask wallets
to perform secure and ef ficient commerce.
2   Introduction
The emer gence of  Web3.0, a new concept of the World
Wide Web, introduces the
newfound ideas of decentralization and blockchain technologies which display the potential to
improve safety , costs, and privacy in various industries, such as the online marketplace and
escrow system. Currently , online marketplace exchanges like Amazon require the private
information of users, a cut of the seller ’s profits ranging from 6%-45% of the total amount of the
sale,
6
and are not very resistant to online faults
and attacks. All of these pose risks to buyers and
sellers while also costing sellers and buyers more money . However , a Web 3.0-influenced,
decentralized, Ethereum-based escrow system would only require one’ s public wallet address
and negligible gas fees instead of a substantial portion of the seller ’s profits. Trusted third-party
firms such as Amazon and eBay were critical prior to blockchain technology and smart contracts
since they address the issue of trust between unknown buyers and sellers in a digital marketplace.
These third parties would establish trust between the buyer and seller by acting as a mediator that
ensures that the buyer will pay and the seller will deliver . However , with smart contracts, the
open source code may replace such firms as mediators, while also eliminating the need for trust
between transactors, but without the aforementioned drawbacks of centralized third parties.
Additionally , decentralized platforms are more tolerant of faults and more resistant to
attacks, making them a better alternative than traditional online marketplace and escrow
platforms.
1
For example, attacks such as DDOS are
more dif ficult to execute against
decentralized networks because nodes are spread all across the world, making DDOS attacks
2very expensive to conduct.
4
Since blockchains are distributed on multiple nodes, there is no
central entity managing the chain, but rather a decentralized peer -to-peer network that prevents
single points of failure, which third parties are often vulnerable to. A decentralized peer -to-peer
network allows for each node to verify blocks or reject blocks that are tampered with and come
to a consensus with the rest of the network before the block is added throughout the network.
This idea makes blockchain much more secure and reliable than third parties, since dishonesty or
attacks would be less feasible, as they would require tampering with all the blocks on the chain
and getting the network’ s consensus, in turn eliminating single points of failure. Furthermore,
data leaks are a growing concern, since third-party firms often store their users’  personal
information, which makes them a common tar get for hackers and security breaches, greatly
jeopardizing the privacy of their users. However , since cryptocurrency wallets have no links to
personal information, blockchain significantly reduces data privacy concerns since only the
transactors’  wallet addresses and transaction details are stored on the blockchain.
A decentralized escrow smart contract would greatly reduce the need for human
interaction and minimize the risk of litigation, in turn reducing costs as well. Via smart contract
code, users may have more trust and a greater sense of reliability , as smart contracts are open
source and transparent, unlike third-party firms that subject their users to rely on often obscure
and undisclosed methods. Thus, by deploying a smart contract through the Ethereum network
(Goerli test Ethereum network) using blockchain technology , buyers and sellers may interact
with the contract through actions such as making deposits to initiate a transaction, canceling
transactions, confirming transactions, and sending receipts. Ultimately , we propose that smart
contracts are a more viable option than third-party arbiters for a trustless marketplace exchange
since our smart contract will securely hold funds until the item is received by the buyer and all
3conditions of the smart contract are met. Using an escrow mechanism that requires buyers and
sellers to make double deposits, which creates a trustless system since the extra deposit locked in
the contract acts as collateral, giving the transactors a strong incentive to complete the
transaction. For example, the seller will be incentivized to ship the item of desire in time,
whereas the buyer will be incentivized to confirm the purchase because they both want to have
their escrow deposit back.
In coordination with our smart contract, our application will include a user -friendly front
end that will make it easy for buyers and sellers to complete transactions. The process of running
our smart contract through Remix Ethereum is not a straightforward process, especially for those
who do not have the technical expertise. This can be a serious roadblock in marketing our
application to the public. Thus, we decided that it would be best to simplify the process while
adding a level of abstraction, via our front-end web application. Furthermore, in the
implementation of our front-end, we incorporated a database to store all relevant information
such as buyers’  shipping address (only visible to the seller)  and the active contracts associated
with the user .
The smart contract process combined with our user friendly front-end web application
will provide users with all of the aforementioned benefits of blockchain technology in an
efficient and convenient manner .
3   Overview
According to the Ethereum website, Ethereum is the
“foundation for building apps and
organizations in a decentralized, permissionless, censorship-resistant way .” The EVM (Ethereum
Virtual Machine) is a computer that the network works with, and anyone on the network may
request computations from the computer . These computations are verified by nodes, or others on
4the network and committed to the updated “state” of the Ethereum network. These EVM state
updates come with a cost of Ether , the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum, some of which is
rewarded to nodes that verify these updates to keep the network secure. All of this data is stored
within blocks that are then stored on the blockchain, where a user can track all of their previous
transactions. This makes the blockchain “traceable” and prevents issues such as
“double-spending” where the same currency is used twice.
Smart contracts are one of the main benefits of the Ethereum blockchain.
They are
Ethereum accounts, just like Ethereum wallet addresses’  that can send and receive transactions,
but instead of being controlled by a user , “they are deployed to the network and run as
programmed.”
3
Simply put, smart contracts use a snippet
of code to enforce the conditions that
are previously defined on them. In the case of our project, smart contracts would run the
transaction between the two parties who use our service. For example, if user A would like to
sell an item to user B, they would note the transfer in the smart contract along with the transfer of
Ether (the currency that our system will use). Upon completion of the condition in the smart
contract, user A will receive the Ether and user B will receive the item that they desired from
user A.
This is a basic summary of the smart contract, but when implemented, there will be other
aspects as well such as an Ether amount working as collateral, to ensure both parties stay honest
and do not cheat each other of the item or Ether . Upon completion of a smart contract, the
transaction will be stored on the Ethereum blockchain and can always be verified by the involved
parties. The whole process will be orchestrated through the front end of our decentralized
application where the users begin by connecting to their Metamask account. After connecting,
users can deploy and search for smart contracts which will begin the process of the decentralized
5arrangement. From there, users fill the necessary fields and have access to the functions they
need to complete their transaction. This data, and all other relevant data is stored in a database in
order to facilitate the product searching process and other core functionalities of our app that
require the active smart contract addresses associated with accounts.
4   Literature Review
Several decentralized crypto-currency-based trading
systems similar to our model have
been deployed. These platforms have been developed for the aforementioned advantages of
removing the mediating third party from commodity exchanges, which eliminates any potential
high transaction fees, restrictions, or censorship while also ensuring the anonymity and data
security of the transactors.
5
For example, in N. I. Schwartzbach’ s (2020) paper , it is indicated that smart contracts can
work as the arbiter and only invoke if disputes arise.
8
Normally , the buyer will transfer the value
of goods in cryptocurrency as escrow and notify the contract when receiving the goods. The
money as escrow will then be transferred to the seller , which terminates the contract. However , if
disputes occur during the transaction, one party will place money of arbitrary value as a wager .
The other party will also place the same amount of money as a wager to counter this dispute.
This paper develops an arbiter based on mathematical deduction. According to the paper , the
arbiter will judge in favor of the honest party based on evidence. The winner of the dispute will
gain back the cost of the goods plus the wager , while the loser gains nothing. However , errors in
judgment will always happen because the judgment is based on probability , thus a smart contract
working as an arbiter in this case isn’ t the best approach as the stakes for errors may be high.
This dif fers from our smart contract protocol for a decentralized exchange because, in our
protocol, both buyers and sellers will need to put twice the amount of the transaction as escrow ,
6which incentivizes the completion of the transaction and reduces the chance of arbitration.
Moreover , if disputes happen, both parties are incentivized to resolve the dispute because only
when the dispute is resolved can both parties get their escrow back.
Furthermore, Zimbeck’ s (2014) paper established a trustless escrow system that relies on
the concept of two-party double deposits and the world’ s first decentralized smart contract
protocol, BitHalo.
8
BitHalo was developed to address
the issues of early smart contract
protocols, which lacked a feasible mechanism for trustless transactions. Additionally
,
transactions on early smart contract protocols like the one in Schwartzbach’ s paper were often
vulnerable to transaction malleability , where raw transaction data may be changed or exchanged
before broadcasting, ultimately invalidating the transaction. Such vulnerabilities allowed for
extortion and attacks such as double-spend attacks.
8
As a result, BitHalo introduced a two-party
double deposit protocol that not only addressed these vulnerabilities mentioned above but also
introduced a mechanism for trustless online marketplaces that rely on code rather than a
mediating entity .
BitHalo's smart contract protocol for a decentralized exchange is similar to ours, since
twice the amount of the transaction is held as escrow to incentivize honest behavior and the
completion of the terms of the smart contract. According to BitHalo’ s design principles, if any of
the parties break the commitment, or do not finish the transaction in a timely manner , the escrow
will time out and destroy itself; thus, both parties lose money . This leads BitHalo to be
considered the “mother of unbreakable contracts.”
However , one fundamental dif ference is that our smart contract protocol will run on the
Ethereum blockchain whereas BitHalo is software-based and uses Bitcoin as currency . However ,
the contract is not on the Bitcoin blockchain (i.e., a record of contracts not stored on
7blockchain).
2
It is important to consider that BitHalo’ s off-blockchain decentralized smart
contract protocol has the advantage of not bloating the blockchain and allowing for greater
complexity contracts, whereas Ethereum smart contracts have a max size of 25 KB due to gas
limitations.
3, 2
On the other hand, the benefits to
our protocol via Ethereum smart contracts is that
they are able to execute on blockchain and stored in a distributed manner along with
cryptographic mechanisms for a greater degree of security in terms of being tamper -proof and
immutable. Moreover , our protocol also has the benefit of running on the Ethereum blockchain,
which is proof-of-stake, resulting in lower overhead and a significantly lower carbon footprint
than other blockchains that often run on proof-of-work.
5     Infrastructure
5.1   High-Level Infrastructure
●
Remix-Ether eum
: Remix-Ethereum is where we write our
smart contract code. From
Remix-Ethereum, we are able to deploy our smart contract. Any changes in code must be
updated here and redeployed.
●
MetaMask W allet
: The buyer/seller must connect to
their MetaMask wallet, in order to
utilize the smart contract, as the currency (Ether) is contained in the MetaMask wallet.
The MetaMask wallet is also used for its unique ID (public key) to recognize an account
(unique identifier for security purposes such as verifying suf ficient funds).
●
Goerli T est Networ
k: This is the network where our
smart contracts run until our protocol
is ready for production. It is a test Ethereum network that replicates the Ethereum
Network (EVM - Ethereum Virtual Machine) and uses the test currency we are using,
Goerli Test Ether . We use a test network and test Ethereum due to the expense of using
8actual Ethereum for contract deployment and testing. Despite developing our Dapp using
the Goerli Test Network, for the sake of our demo, we used the Polygon Mumbai Test
Network because the Goerli Test Network was under heavy traf fic at the time due to the
upcoming Ethereum update.
●
Etherscan.io
: We now use etherscan.io as a dashboard
to monitor active contracts.
Previously , prior to the development of our website, this was also where we ran, verified,
(ensuring the bytecode for contract execution is the same as when it was deployed),
published, read from, wrote to, and monitored smart contracts. However , we can now do
all the core functionalities through our website and leave Etherscan.io just for monitoring.
●
Javascript: JavaScript helped us set up and connect our smart contract to our website, or
front end, essentially working as the bridge for our decentralized application. In
particular , the Node.js and Express.js packages were used for connecting with MetaMask,
our database, and our smart contract code.
●
Parse Server: Parse is a back end that we used in conjunction with Node.js to set up our
database and store all relevant data. We are using a NoSQL  database via Parse using
MongoDB that contains entries for each user . It’s used to record user information
necessary to complete a transaction such as buyer wallet address, item contract address,
quantity to purchase, etc. One thing to note is that there is no private information stored
except for the buyer's shipping address which is only visible to respective sellers while
the buyer has an active transaction.
95.2    Smart Contract Design Principles
In order to ensure that both parties are incentivized to complete the transaction, the buyer
and the seller will each deposit twice the amount of ETH into the contract as escrow . The ETH
payment will remain locked inside the contract until the buyer confirms receipt of the promised
item.  After the buyer confirms receiving the item, the buyer will be sent their deposit back
minus the cost of the item and next the seller will be able to “claim payment”, so that they will
be sent their deposit back plus the profit from the transaction. Currently , each seller deploys one
contract for one item onto the Goerli test Ethereum network and each buyer can only have one
ongoing transaction associated with one item but have no limit on the quantity to buy except for
stock limitations. There is also no limit on the buyers for each contract or on the stock quantity
for each item. Once the seller deploys the contract and adds an item to the unique contract, the
item and seller information is immutable. Since each item listing is immutable once contract is
deployed smart contract is set forth (set forth via AddItem() function), our e-commerce platform
is similar to NFT  platforms which similarly use a smart contract for each NFT  listed to ensure
immutability . We will determine the success of our protocol by analyzing the time elapsed
between the time transactions were initiated until the time they were resolved along with
analyzing the distribution of successful transactions and cancellations. Thus, shorter times
elapsed for transactions and higher rates of successful resolutions will be our metric for
evaluating success. Furthermore, once our protocol goes into production, we intend to record
transaction details in order to conduct analysis that will optimize our protocol. A potential
approach to optimizing our protocol will be finding an optimal value for the escrow deposit
amount. For instance, by setting the deposit amount as a factor that is more than the item value
but no more than twice the amount of the item, depending on the transaction details and patterns
1 0learned from our analysis, in order to achieve shorter contract completion times, more contract
completions, and incentivize users to use our platform. For our current implementation our value
factor for the escrow is 2x and will allow for multiple buyers as detailed in section 6.3.

5.3    Decentralized Web Application Design Principles
The front end of our application, known as the dApp
or the decentralized application will
provide an easy-to-use interface solution to access the functions and capabilities of our smart
contract code. In the back end, a Parse database using MongoDB will record transaction
information and users’  contract addresses in order to facilitate our website functionalities and the
transaction process.
A user can be either buyer or seller . As buyers, they can shop the marketplace and search
for items of desire. At the same time, they can also deploy new contracts to list items for sale.
Both buyers and sellers have dashboards where they access and act on their active and completed
transactions. If they decide to deploy a new contract, they must provide all necessary
1 1
information, such as the total escrow amount, the quantity of the item, and the price of each
individual item, as well as other relevant details. Following this, the seller will then need to
connect to their MetaMask account wallet after which they will have access to all of their
necessary functions to work with the contract as a seller .
The process for a buyer is relatively similar with some minor dif ferences. The buyer will
need to connect to their MetaMask account wallet and will then have access to all of their
necessary functions to work with the contract as a buyer .
6     Methods
6.1   Setting the Contract in Motion
Our online escrow marketplace will be run through a smart contract via our front-end
website, and in order to understand the process of executing our smart contract,  it is crucial to
distinguish between some terminology . Each party in our escrow system will have their own
MetaMask wallet, which contains their Ether and their unique wallet address, which is necessary
for identifying the selling party and the buying party . For the purposes of our sample, we have
two metamask wallet accounts which each represent a party in our sample transaction.
Henceforth, we will refer to the purchasing party’ s MetaMask account as the “buyer”, or the
“buyer ’s account” and the selling party’ s account as the “seller”, or the “seller ’s account.” The
transaction must be commenced from the point of view of the seller . The seller deploys the smart
contracts via our website, with the necessary Ether cost attached to it (twice the product amount
for x items), to cover two times the transaction costs for escrow (not including the negligible gas
fee). For example, if the seller sells ten items, the Ether cost attached will be twice the total
amount of the ten items. The smart contract is then documented on Etherscan.io for the buyer
1 2and seller to monitor . The seller must also set values for the item_price_in_ETH, item_quantity ,
item_name, item_details, and item_description which will be passed into respective read only
functions that may be utilized by the buyer before confirming purchase.
6.2   Transaction process
Now that the seller has put the smart contract of ficially in motion, two times the total
product price is held in the contract and a buyer must make the next step. However , if a suitable
buyer is not found, the seller has the ability to terminate the contract and this will refund their
Ether deposited in the contract. The transaction process is secured by the buyer states, which tells
us which stage of the contract the buyer is in. The contract tracks the transaction process with
three buyer states (Paid, Shipped, and Received) and the strict buyer state check before each step
ensures the process runs smoothly and ef ficiently . Once buyers confirm their purchase and
deposit two times the transaction amount into the smart contract, their state becomes “paid” in
the system. With both parties double depositing, they will both bear the same risk if the contract
is not completed, creating an equally strong incentive for both parties to complete the
transaction. At this point, the buyer ’s MetaMask account is connected to the smart contract and
recognized as the purchaser , by confirming the purchase. Now , the escrows for both buyer and
seller are locked in the contract, as an agreement is being initiated between the two
acknowledged parties. Next, the seller ships the desired item to the buyer and the buyer state
changes from “Paid” to “Shipped.” The Ether will be locked into the contract until the buyer
confirms receiving the promised item agreed upon. Thus, upon receipt of the purchased item, the
buyer , who is in the “Shipped” state, will confirm that they have received the purchase, at which
point the buyer will be refunded half of their input into the smart contract (1x the price of the
1 3product). Following this, the buyer state becomes “Received” and gets removed from the buyer
hashmap and indicated by our parse database as “completed” buyer . This means the buyer no
longer exists in the smart contract. Finally , the seller will refund their stored Ether for the
transaction, to receive their whole input, as well as the revenue generated from the transaction
(total of 3x the price of the product to account for the seller ’s profit and their original deposit).
6.3   Implementation and Contract Execution Model
Figur e 3. Class diagram of our implementation for an escr ow smart contract (pur chase.sol)
1 4
The purchase contract contains one class including attributes such as State, Map,
maxBuyerNumber , buyerNumber , terminated (boolean), ready (boolean) and two constructor
attributes (seller address and escrowLeft). The state is one of the most crucial attributes as it has
three dif ferent potential values (Paid, Shipped, and Received) which will determine the
operations that the contract can conduct at a given time. The variable Map is a hashmap that
stores the current  buyers . A constructor helps store the current escrow left using an attribute
named escrowLeft,  which will be in one of the modifiers to check if the escrows are suf ficient
enough to accept a new buyer . The sellers have to initialize the item value and item quantity and
they will be able to add item attributes after the deployment of the contract through setter
functions. It is important to note that there exists a condition to check that before a buyer wants
to register , at least one item has been added, meaning that the seller has to process the setter
function at least once after deployment. This would be before any buyers interact with the
previously mentioned deployed contract. Besides all getter and setter functions, the class has 8
functions, some of which may run strictly based on the modifier check and the state check.
Detailed descriptions of the functions, along with their respective logic is presented in the flow
diagram in Figure 4 (see next page).

contract. The high-level idea of each function is explained in section 6.1 and 6.2 above.

8   Conclusion
Our platform decentralizes peer -to-peer e-commerce using blockchain and smart
contracts for increased security , transparency , and cost-ef fectiveness; allowing for a trustless
marketplace. The combination of our easy to navigate front end combined with our smart
contract code makes it a simple process for any individual to safely and securely process
transactions without third parties and their overbearing costs and safety concerns. However , the
true limitless potential of decentralization lies deeper in the idea that we can safely eliminate the
need for third-party mediation in not only centralized marketplaces but also in other industries
such as finance, insurance, real estate, supply chain, gaming, and more. Thus, decentralization
promises to be the future in all the aforementioned industries as it quells privacy fears and
eliminates unnecessary costs, while putting the decision completely in the hands of the two
opposing parties, rather than relying on a third party for anything.
10   Limitations and Future Work
1)
Our platform currently uses the Ethereum blockchain network for all transactions.
However , to provide a more convenient user experience, we are storing some information
such as public wallet address, product info, and shipping info (for physical goods) in our
own database. In the future, we plan to take our decentralization ef forts a step further by
1 7migrating all stored information to a decentralized file system, such as the InterPlanetary
File System (IPFS). By doing so, we can ensure that files, such as images, cannot be
modified once they are stored on a fully decentralized system. This stands in contrast to
the content that we currently store in our own database, which is editable by both
backend developers and external hackers. We understand that certain user data, such as
shipping info, needs to be kept private and secure. To achieve this, we plan to encrypt
sensitive data before storing it on IPFS. Specifically , we will apply a specific hash
function to the data and store the encrypted result on IPFS. Only the seller of a particular
transaction will have the key to the hash function, ensuring that the shipping address is
only visible to them, just like it is now .
By transitioning all data storage to a decentralized file system, we aim to transform our
platform from a partially web2-based application to a fully decentralized web3-based
app. Although transactions are already decentralized, this move will make our app even
more secure and trustworthy .
2)
Currently , we have implemented a double deposit escrow policy to ensure the honesty
and validity of our transactions Currently online marketplaces lar gely favor the interests
of buyers rather than sellers on their platform. This is because sellers have to give
companies a cut of their profits, while buyers bare little to no risk in placing orders due to
customer services that often provide safeguards such as refunds that eliminate buyers’
concerns when shopping on the online realm. With our double deposit system, buyers and
sellers would have to potentially deposit very significant amounts of Ether which they
1 8may prefer to spend/save/invest otherwise or may not af ford; Thus, going forward, we
must find a compromising solution to attract users, by making our platform feasible and
comfortable to buyers. Ultimately , we fear that some consumers may be unwilling to use
our service when they can find centralized alternatives that let consumers hold their
money themselves. At the least, we plan to minimize this deposit which will be done
through statistical testing and machine learning models once our service is running to
find the optimal deposit rate to ensure that trust is maximized while the collateral deposit
stays low enough for buyers to still be comfortable and incentivized to use our platform.
3)
Due to the decentralized and non-profit nature of our service, we cannot af ford any
unforeseen circumstances in regards to transactions. Thus, to avoid losing items in transit,
we would consider partnering with a transportation service and provide tracking to our
consumers to ensure that nothing gets lost in transit. This is crucial because if an item is
lost, the smart contract would not be complete and would need to be voided, and the
seller ’s product would not be recovered. Therefore, it is a priority for us to ensure that
this scenario is avoided.
4)
We would also like to include a section for product reviews, to resemble other
e-commerce websites. We plan to implement a decentralized review system into our
platform to provide more reliable and transparent product reviews and ratings. This is
significant, because current e-commerce platforms have vulnerabilities in their review
systems, since they are not decentralized, allowing for reviews and ratings to easily be
dishonestly manipulated. Ultimately , using blockchain and smart contract technology , we
1 9can ensure the credibility of reviews, which in turn will make our platform more
attractive to buyers since our products will be more reputable and transparent.
9
5)
Finally , despite the promising signs from our project, there are still edge cases that we
still need to cover due time limitations. For example, one buyer can only have one
ongoing transaction associated with one item. In the future, we need to enable multiple
ongoing transactions of the same item for a particular buyer . Also, we need to implement
a refund system where the buyer can return the item he doesn’ t like and both parties can
claim their escrows.

Abstract
Textual data in the financial domain is becoming increasingly important as the
number of financial documents rapidly grows. With the progress in natural lan-
guage processing (NLP), extracting valuable information has gained popularity
among researchers, deep learning has boosted the development of effective finan-
cial text mining models and made significant breakthroughs in various Natural
Language Processing tasks. State-of-the-art models such as BERT (Devlin et al.,
2019) model developed by Google, GPT2 (Radford et al., 2018) by OpenAI, XL-
Net (Yang et al.,2019), pre-trained on a large scale of unlabeled texts from various
corpuses, have shown their effectiveness by achieving good results on general do-
main data. However, these models are not effective enough on finance specific
language and semantics, limiting the accuracy that financial users can expect from
their NLP models. In this project, we will finetune the popular transformers based
on the pretrained models provided by Hugging Face using our collected manually
labeled financial data. Furthermore, we provide web scraping utilities along with
the specific financial domain language models, in order to better assist users in
financial domain capture market trends and be alerted by the risk factors.
1mentor: Zhiting Hu2 Introduction
In recent years, Deep Learning has revolutionized the development of intelligent systems in many
fields especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP) using state-of-the-art architectures that sig-
nificantly improved many NLP tasks. With the recent progress made in NLP, researchers are starting
to pay more attention to tackling numerous tasks in finance. As the amount of textual content gen-
erated in the financial domain is growing at an exponential rate, natural language processing is
becoming a strategic tool for financial analysis. For example, financial practitioners are often re-
quired to use a set of NLP techniques, such as financial text classification and sentimental analysis
for risk assessment, stock investment, and market trend detection. Some of the researchers construct
an end-to-end model for making the prediction. Sentiment analysis approaches are more common in
this field, thus providing insights on financial decision-making. Such models include V AE, Capsule
network, hybrid attention network, BERT, XLNet, etc. While Transformer based language mod-
els are widely used for product understanding, as well as market trend prediction. The most used
NLP sentiment analysis method is polarity, which classifies the input text as positive, neutral, or
negative. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is an open-source Ma-
chine Learning (ML) model for NLP well-used for classification. However, BERT is pre-trained
on general English corpora, and the financial domain has its technical jargon, which can lead to an
output misinterpretation. Therefore, it’s not suitable for understanding domain-specific vocabulary.
Nonetheless, FinBERT, based on the BERT model, fills the gap with a domain-specific terminology
by overlapping BERT vocabulary (BaseV ocab) for another (FinV ocab). As the industry developed
and transformer architecture being widely used, in order to standardize all the steps involved in
training and using a language model, Hugging Face was founded. They’re democratizing NLP by
constructing an API that allows easy access to pretrained models, datasets and tokenizing steps.
Within HuggingFace, Transformers was build as an open-source library with the goal of opening
up these advances to the wider machine learning community. There are other open source libraries
such as Spacy that are very helpful in creating fine-tuned models specific for NLP tasks. Spacy uses
a CNN and can perform a wide variety of tasks such as tokenization, part of speech tagging, named
entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and so much more. In terms of financial applications, a Spacy
model can be trained to pull keywords out of tweets and determine popularity of certain stocks and
decide whether to invest or not using that information or a combination of stock history/data. Most
Spacy models use word vectors, representations of different words that allow you to compare sim-
ilarities between other words, in order to accurately take into account all parts of the sentence. In
addition, this project will also include useful tools for financial users to utilize, in order to better
capture the market trend and avoid risks. Particularly, scraping tools for tweets regarding companies
will be prepared, while we will build tools for scraping federal financial reports as well. Therefore,
users can identify risk factors as well as catch market sentiment in real time, thus better assisting
financial decisions.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
• Collect financial related manually sentiment labeled data for training
• Construct handful tweets scraping tool
• Polarize part of real time tweets text using Spacy to expand training dataset
• Fine-tune 5 popular transformers based on pre-trained models in HuggingFace
–Bert
–FinBert
–Financial Bert
–XLNet
–GPT2
• Build handy pipelines and APIs to retrieve financial information from Twitter to detect
stock related sentiment.
23 Methods
3.1 Dataset
The dataset utilized during the sentiment classification procedure is important to the research since
it has a substantial impact on classification performance. Given the purpose stated, the dataset must
be text with short length relevant to the stock market, as the objective is sentiment analysis of stock
market or company analysis. The main sentiment analysis dataset used in this project consists of
three parts: Financial PhraseBank, IEEE DataPort and Kaggle tweets dataset. All three datasets
are financial related and manually labeled with sentiment scores. In total, the dataset collected
for this project has 11,936 financial related text, each with a custom labeled sentiment score in 0
(neutral), 1 (positive) or -1 (negative). Due to the lack of training text in the financial field and the
scarcity of manually labeled ones, the collected dataset may be insufficient to train a model with
better performance. The raw data should be mapped with sentiment scores across a larger size of
tweets to perform sentiment analysis. For sentiment analysis, these sentiment scores are afterwards
concatenated into the training dataset. There are several Python libraries that are available, to use
to accomplish this type of preprocessing in Natural Language Processing, for example TextBlob
and Vader Analyzer. In this project, an open source package called Spacy will be introduced for
polarization of larger data sets and be used for training and validation. As a result, we will have 80%
of data for training and validation while 20% for testing.
Financial Phrasebank consists of 4,845 English financial headlines that were categorized by senti-
ment class and were annotated by 16 researchers with a financial background. The sentiment label
is either positive, neutral or negative. The dataset is available in four possible configurations, de-
pending on the percentage of agreement of annotators (50%, 66%, 75%, and 100%). In this project,
we choose to have the whole Data (at least 50% agreement).
IEEE DataPort (Taborda et al., 2021), dataset can be found here The IEEE DataPort stock market
tweets dataset consist of tweets between April 9 and July 16, 2020, using the SP 500 tag (SPX500),
the references to the top 25 companies in the SP 500 index, and the Bloomberg tag (stocks). 1,300
out of the 943,672 tweets were manually annotated in positive, neutral, or negative classes. In this
project, we will only take the manually labeled data.
Kaggle tweets dataset (Yash Chaudhary, 2020), dataset can be found here Gathered Stock news
from Multiple twitter Handles regarding Economic news and custom labeled, which was divided
into two parts : Negative(-1) and positive(1). Negative count: 2,106 Positive count: 3,685. We
will be programming a downloading mechanism to download the Kaggle datasets while running the
pipeline to avoid memory wasting caused by pre-saving datasets.
3.2 Time Series
In this quarter, we were able to implement LSTM, CNN, and TreNet as three different deep learning
models to predict financial time series data. From our progress in this quarter, we are confident that
our goals for FinDL are achievable within the given timeframe. We will first focus on conducting
research into how we can improve the current implementations of our models and search for other
popular and state of the art models to include in our library. Based on the models and improvements
we want to implement, we will design the implementation of the library, including the deep learning
models, data pre-processing, and feature extraction methods. We will focus on ease of use and
straightforward customization of models and fine tuning parameters that is catered towards users in
the finance domain. With the design of the library and deep learning models, we will implement all
of the models and methods in a finance deep learning library for other users to use in their finance
domain machine learning applications.
3.3 Tokenizers and Models
Throughout Quarter 1 and Quarter 2, we have been investing time exploring and studying trans-
formers tokenizers and models. Transformers were first introduced in 2017 and ever since have been
revolutionary. Instead of using RNNs or convolution, transformers adopt a self-attention mechanism
that has been proven to be more efficient. Transformers models are built upon seq2seq models that
consist of encoders and decoders. Taking a machine translation model for example, the encoder
3encodes input text and the decoder decodes the outputs from the encoder. NLP models from Trans-
formers are based solely on attention mechanisms in order to draw global dependencies between
inputs and outputs. There are apparent benefits of the self-attention mechanism, including learning
long range dependencies, yielding more interpretable results, and maximizing the amount of paral-
lelizable computations. We observe that BERT is the most popular language model on the platform,
and many other models are built based on BERT. BERT is a language model pre-trained on Masked
LM and Next Sentence Prediction. It is widely used for sentiment analysis, sentence classification
and interactive QA. We decided to look further into BERT and understand the various variations
of it. In addition to BERT, we fine-tuned several pre-trained models based on other architectures,
for example XLNet and GPT2. Upon researching, we discovered that some of the models listed on
Hugging Face are specifically designed for financial texts. Combining the models and the Trans-
formers’ architecture, we aim to try out this new approach towards sentiment analysis for our final
Project.
3.4 Pre-train Model Approach
For this project, we chose to fine-tune on the pretrained models provided by Hugging Face, which
consists of three major steps when designing.
• Choose a source model: From the available models, a pre-trained source model is picked.
Over the years, many teams and researchers trained models based on vast and difficult
datasets, while Hugging Face collected most of them with easy to use APIs. Thus, we can
easily find ideal models from Hugging Face hub based on our task. For example, since our
datasets deal with financial stock information, we aim to find models that are specifically
tailored for financial datasets such as finbert.
• Model for Reuse: The pre-trained model can then be utilized to build a model for the second
job of interest, in this case, we can use them for financial sentiment analysis. Depending on
the modeling technique employed, this may entail using all or sections of the model. We
create an easy mechanism for users to select and download our pre-trained models to best
fit their use cases.
• Fine-tuned: On the input-output pair data available for the job of interest, the model may
need to be altered or refined, in this project, we will continue the training using our collected
data and alter some hyperparameters. In our final library, we will add APIs for users to self-
tune the models in case they find better parameters.
3.5 Model Details
3.5.1 BERT
The use of a pre-trained model is prevalent. BERT and XLNet, and other models are examples of this
type. There are numerous advantages of employing transfer learning. Higher start, high rate of skill
increase, and superior converged skill are a few of them (Dussa, 2020). Bidirectional Transformer
Encoder Representations (BERT) is a bidirectional encoder transformer paradigm. This model was
created to help Google AI Language pre-train deep bidirectional representations to extract context-
sensitive properties from input text (Devlin et al., 2018). BERT learns contextual relationships
between words in a text via an attention mechanism in the transformer. Transformer is made up
of two mechanisms: an encoder that reads the text input and a decoder that generates the task
prediction.
4Figure 1. The Transformer based BERT base Architecture with twelve encoder blocks (Khalid et
al., 2021)
One model that is trained based on the BERT model is the FinBERT model. This model is pre-trained
to focus on sentiment analysis of financial text. (Araci, 2019) Like BERT, this model gives softmax
outputs as labels for each piece of financial text. During training, we observe that performance of
FinBERT appears to be better than the BERT model alone. Therefore we will use this model as our
main model for training with additional arguments tuned for our training datasets.
3.5.2 XLNet
XLNet is a language model proposed by researchers from Google AI Brain Team and Carnegie Mel-
lon University (Yang et al.,2019) that learns unsupervised representations of text sequences using
a generalized autoregressive language model. BERT masks the words, presuming that the masked
words have nothing in common. The interdependence of the disguised words is not considered. The
XLNet system can overcome this disadvantage. XLNet employs the permutational language mod-
eling technique. In order to cover both forward and backward directions, XLNet evaluates all po-
tential permutations. Simply put, XLNet maintains the original sequence order, employs positional
encodings, and employs a specific attention mask in Transformers to achieve the aforementioned
factorization order permutation. To keep track of anticipated words and consider them in the next
token prediction, XLNet employs a two-stream self-attention technique. (Yang et al., 2019; Dussa,
2020)
Figure 2. Diagram of XLNet’s architecture (Yang et al., 2019; Dussa, 2020)
53.6 Implementation Details
The dataset was collected through three sources: Financial PhraseBank, IEEE DataPort and Kaggle
tweets dataset. The features of the training data consists of financial text and the labels are either
0(neutral), 1(positive) or -1(negative). 11,936 samples were collected, and the training process is
efficient with less time cost. Additionally, a pipeline for training multiple transformers was deployed
on 1 NVIDIA 2080ti GPU. We tokenize our inputs using AutoTokenizer provided by Transformers
on the pre-trained FinBERT model. While tokenizing, we pad the inputs according to the maximum
length in the dataset to ensure that the vectors are of the same dimensions. FinBERT is a project
brought out by Prosus that was fine-tuned on BERT specifically for financial text in 2019. Compared
with the traditional BERT language model, FinBERT performs much better on financial text. Our
training set consists of the FinancialPhraseBank, which was originally used to develop FinBERT,
and the dataset of similar format. We use the Trainer provided by Transformers to train our model.
Upon training, we have discovered that there are many ways we can fine-tune the already fine-tuned
FinBERT model. We believe that we can achieve a better performance if we adjust the parameters
specifically for stock information text.
3.7 Polarity Assignment and Target Dataset - Spacy
In order to run the package in real-time, a data generation pipeline had to be set up so current data
could easily be pulled into the model for evaluation as well as building a target dataset for our final
objective, capture market trend. The easiest way to do this was to use the internet’s town square,
Twitter. When a user inputs a certain stock into the model, e.g. AAPL, we used the Twitter API
to go and grab the latest tweets containing the keyword “AAPL”, and send those to the model for
classification. This was great until we found out that Twitter was going to start charging for access
to their API, something that had been free at a basic level for many years.
The only issue with this is that the data looks slightly different from training data, and to create a bit
more training data as well as a new validation dataset on these tweets can be beneficial for a better
performance. That is where the Spacy model comes in.
A Spacy model was fine-tuned in order to speed up the process of creating more training and valida-
tion data where sentiment could be generated automatically and then manually checked by a human.
This speeds up creating new training data as the majority are already correct when generated and
only few here and there need to be changed. For this project, the last 10000 tweets related with
the five technology giants that dominate the SP 500 index was scraped and labeled with Spacy for
training and testing purposes, they are Apple (ticker AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG),
Amazon.com (AMZN), and Facebook (FB).
3.8 Future Focus
During Quarter 2, our first objective was to try out more models on HuggingFace to get a better
understanding of how different language models work in general. We would like to fine-tune them
and eventually figure out what the best model is for our dataset. Then we would like to obtain more
training data, preferably from real-time sources. By obtaining more data, we hope to further improve
our accuracy on the sentiment analysis task. Finally, we would like to try to build our own language
model for stock text, likely on top of BERT. Even though FinBERT has performed relatively well
on financial textual data, we believe that a language model that is specifically built for stock textual
data would better fit our goal. We aim to integrate our sentiment analysis method into the library that
we will deliver at the end of Quarter 2. We would like to provide a model that is easy to understand
and also user-friendly.
4 Results/Experiment evaluation
The following table presents the sentiment analysis results in a classification report on the test set.
Although our fine-tuned models did not significantly outperform common baselines, the BERT-base
(Devlin et al., 2019), they still achieved decent results. Our models achieved better performance than
the state-of-the-art model for general tasks on testing dataset, which demonstrates its effectiveness
in financial sentiment analysis.

the following package can be used for finance companies deploying models for automatic document
classification. In this case, they will need approaches that can scale well and are simple to deploy,
but have no need to train or fine-tune the model. By using the package we provide, they are able to
search the model and use a pretrained and fine-tuned classification model designed for accurate, fast
inference. If needed, continuing training on user customized data is possible. They were able to run
and deploy the model directly from our package with no required research or ML expertise.
Risk is also an important attribute of financial instruments. For the purpose of detecting risk, we
will build handy scraping tools to extract annual financial reports from the Security and Exchange
Commission (SEC), which consists of Risk Factors and other crucial information in terms of invest-
ment. In other words, this package enables consultants to build a dynamic portfolio and monitor
assets through market sentiment and evaluate the risk of a company from the financial reports.
6 Conclusion
Using a combination of different models we were able to achieve an accuracy above baseline model,
although they are not significantly outperforming the baseline model, but it’s as we expected given
that our future plan consists of further training and fine tuning. Along with that, our F1 score was
above baseline model as well. Looking at the F1 score is important in addition to the accuracy as it
allows us to get a better sense of the data even if the distribution of the data is uneven. When feeding
in data in real time, there may be a large influx of either positive or negative tweets about a certain
stock that can skew the data. Overall, we were very pleased with the performance of our models and
are excited to further increase the performance and utilities of our package next quarter.

Abstract
Time series data has gained much attention in numerous fields of scientific research and industry. With time
series data available in almost any field, researchers and practitioners are able to extract different features
and information from time series data to utilize in a variety of real-world applications. Deep learning
models have also achieved great success and proved their validity and impact in time series forecasting
tasks, finding great success in tasks such as predicting future stock trends. However, developing effective
deep learning models for time series forecasting tasks requires an extensive amount of machine learning
knowledge, which may be a barrier for financial specialists who lack this expertise. To bridge this gap, we
introduce FinDL, a library designed for both financial specialists and machine learning engineers. FinDL
provides an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for time series data, with out-of-the-box models that
can be configured and fine-tuned according to the users’ requirements. With this library, users can easily
create and deploy machine learning models for finance-related tasks.
Introduction
Time series data, which are data points collected over time, can be found or generated in any
domain. These types of data are extremely valuable due to its nature of holding trend sequence
information. Such data are generally used in a wide variety of applications such as predicting future
stock market prices, gold prices, weather forecast, and energy consumption forecasting. In the field
of finance, financial specialists can use their domain expertise and knowledge to make informed
decisions for finance related tasks. On the other hand, machine learning engineers are able to build
deep learning models that can extract sequential information from time series trends and use these
patterns to make automated predictions. Utilizing the domain expertise of financial specialists to
guide machine learning systems built by machine learning engineers, model performance has the
potential to significantly improve. However, this can be challenging due to resources, poor team
communication, or time sensitive business needs.
To solve this issue, FinDL aims to provide users with modularized machine learning components
to build their own pipelines that can be used off-the-shelf. Our library includes models that can
be fine-tuned for the target task and lets users easily deploy machine learning systems quickly
for financial time-series related tasks. The library also includes a data loader component and data
preprocessing functions for users to load, clean, and transform data into machine learning ready
state. We also provide various machine learning models for users to experiment and choose from to
optimize their machine learning system’s performance. Lastly, our library includes components to
train, evaluate, and visualize the model’s performance to help users create useful models and observe
the model’s performance during its training. All of these components were designed to provide users
a simple and straightforward way to create an end-to-end machine learning pipeline. In regard to
the prediction models, numerous deep learning models have received promising results in time series
analysis. Recurrent neural networks are known for their capability of learning, remembering, and
extracting information from sequential data. Commonly, RNN, along with its variants such as the
Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), are used for time series forecasting applications. Hybrid deep
learning models that combine multiple model structures together often yield promising and possibly2 Gao Mo, Nathan Ng, Richard Tang, Zhiting Hu

better results as well. TreNet, for example, is a hybrid model that combines the results generated
from CNN and LSTM together to make predictions through a feature fusion layer.
However, building the above-mentioned deep learning models using Pytorch or Tensorflow
from scratch requires a significant amount of knowledge in using these machine learning frameworks
as well as how to create deep learning networks. In many cases, users have to preprocess their data
to meet the requirements of the data loaders provided by these APIs. In addition, users have to
implement the training loop and loss visualization functions on their own. This process can be
extremely time consuming and difficult for people who lack the experience using deep learning
libraries or even programming in general. In comparison, FinDL allows users to easily load and
preprocess data with a few lines of code, significantly simplifying the process to prepare data for
machine learning. Model selection and model training also take only a few lines to implement,
allowing users to focus more on defining their machine learning system instead of implementing the
entire pipeline. FinDL is designed to be a modularized time series forecasting library where users have
the ability to pick and choose different combinations of deep learning system components that they
want to use. This allows user to experiment more with the performance of different combinations of
deep learning models instead of dealing with the implementation of complex deep learning systems.
To demonstrate the functionality of our library, we use a dataset of different statistics from stock
markets around the world, including the opening and closing prices from stock markets in the United
States, China, Canada, and Japan. The data distribution is shown in Fig 1. We used the stock market
exchange data from the New York Stock Exchange, which contains 13,194 observations starting
from December 31, 1965 to May 28, 2021. We create and run a TreNet model to predict future
trend durations and slopes using a pipeline that we created from FinDL.
Related Work
Lots of research has gone into developing high performing deep learning models. Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN)[3] is known for its effectiveness in learning the historical dependencies of time series
and sequence data. One well-known application of RNN in time series forecasting is the multi-factor
RNN work frame proposed by Zhang et al. [4], which uses numerous features, such as the high, low,3
and closing prices of every period, to make predictions. Multi-factor LSTM outperforms ARIMA
and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) by including information in addition to the high price data for
time T, which is the general input data for LSTM models. RNN’s alternative structure, Long-short
Term Memory (LSTM) [5], further improved the model’s performance by resolving the vanishing
gradient issue. Sagheer was able to successfully use LSTM to forecast future petroleum production
using LSTM [6].
Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are generally used for image recognition, feature detection,
and extraction [7]. Its feature extraction functionality makes it valuable in time series forecasting
tasks. While it does not outperform RNN and LSTM models in time series forecasting, CNN’s
ability to extract local data features is crucial in improving a model’s performance. Gated Recurrent
Unit, proposed by Cho et al. [new], is a modified version of LSTM. Compared to LSTM, GRU is
known for its simpler implementation and computation. Unlike LSTM, GRU does not pass memory
information during its computation, therefore occupies less memory space and has a faster computing
time. Due to its perk, GRU generally performs better on smaller datasets, while LSTM achieves
higher accuracy on bigger datasets.
Hybrid models designed for time series analysis have also gained much popularity lately. For
example, Livieris et al. [8] successfully analyzed and forecasted gold price time series data by using
the raw data as input for both CNN and LSTM. The aim was for CNN to learn and extract the
feature information and for LSTM to learn the trend sequence dependencies. TreNet, on the other
hand, combines the results from CNN, which extracts the information from the local features of time
series data, with the results from LSTM, which extracts information from the duration and slope of
the current trend in the time series data. TreNet has been proven to outperform numerous traditional
and hybrid models used for time series analysis, including LSTM, ARIMA, Hidden Markov Model,
and Support Vector Regression.
However, the introduction of these deep learning models do not cover much information about
the implementations. People who do not have much programming experience and background
knowledge in deep learning may have trouble correctly implementing models, leading to wasted
time and resources. With FinDL, these models come pre-implemented, allowing users to call our
deep learning functions and specify which model they would like to use for their task by utilizing
the different modules in the FinDL library.
Methods
Library Design of FinDL
FinDL was created with the goal of being useful in finance related tasks for both users with little expe-
rience in programming deep learning models and others who can implement deep learning networks.
With these goals, we designed FinDL to be simple to use without any additional configurations, yet
flexible enough to allow for in-depth fine tuning and customization. To accomplish this, we created
independent, customizable module components for each step in the machine learning pipeline. We
identified three general steps in machine learning pipelines, which include data selection, model
selection, and model training. Within these steps, we defined independent components that can be
used out-of-the-box which can be swapped easily for other components and fine-tuned according
to one’s need. Our library design and the modularized components are shown in figure 2.
For model selection, we implemented various time series model architectures that share a uniform
training process that can be used without additional configurations. Since we created our models
using the PyTorch machine learning framework, we chose to allow users to use PyTorch loss
functions and optimizers with our models as they followed the design principles of our library. Under
data selection, we identified two components that users generally needed in a machine learning
pipeline, data loading and data pre-processing. For data loading, we provide users with a simple
class that loads data and formats dates or time data in preparation for time series modeling. In the4 Gao Mo, Nathan Ng, Richard Tang, Zhiting Hu
Fig 2. FinDL Module Stack
data pre-processing module, we created components that processed and restructured the data into a
machine learning ready state. Many of these components are optional and users can select different
combinations of data pre-processing components based on their time series task. Lastly, the model
training component consists of a general training executor that works with all our models and can
be configured to use different optimizers and loss functions. All of these components were designed
to be independent, such that users can easily put components from each module together to create
their own machine learning pipeline.
FinDL Machine Learning Workflow
To begin with, users will be able to load their raw time series data into FinDL’s data loader, which
filters and formats the data to be suitable for further processing. The output of the data loader will
be fed into FinDL’s preprocessor, which utilizes normalization and linear approximation techniques
to extract significant information such as the trend information, slope and duration of each trend,
as well as the local feature information. The users will then input this extracted information into
the deep learning models, including TreNet, LSTM, and CNN, depending on their situation. With
one line of API call, FinDL’s training executor allows the users to effortlessly initiate the training
process and saves the best performing parameters of the model for the users. In addition, the training
and validation loss data will be saved for users to utilize FinDL’s visualization functions to generate
graphs. FinDL provides an end-to-end solution that enables the users to preprocess, analyze, and
visualize their time series data in a deep learning pipeline without much programming experience
required. The figure 3 captures the workflow of FinDL.
Data Loader
Our data loader component simplifies the process of loading and formatting time series data. It’s
capable of handling multiple file formats, including CSV and JSON files, and users only need to
specify the file path and file format to load data in. The data loader also includes datetime formatting
for strings and can filter for specific stock indices or groups. We found that these were common
operations in finance related time-series predictions and included them in our library pipeline to
make data processing much easier.5
Fig 3. FinDL workflow to create and train TreNet
Data Preprocessing
Once data is loaded in using FinDL’s data loader, users can select from a variety of different data
preprocessing functions available in FinDL. All of these functions were designed to seamlessly
integrate with our data loader, so that users can easily call on components in sequence without
dealing with formatting the data. These data preprocessing functions include normalization, which
is a common machine learning technique and has been found to make our models train more
effectively. We include easy to use classes to help users scale and undo that scale with a single line of
code. Furthermore, FinDL also includes advanced functions to extract trend durations and slopes
from time series data, which provides valuable insight into the underlying patterns that raw time
series data might not provide. Since most stock datasets include only the closing prices of stocks for
specific stocks and dates and not trend data, we use a piecewise linear approximation where the length
and slope of each segment corresponds to the trend duration and slope respectively. The algorithm
we used to accomplish this is the SW AB segmentation algorithm introduced by Keogh et al. This
technique combines the well-known sliding windows and bottom-up algorithms for piecewise linear
approximation. This also allows users to experiment with different types of prediction tasks instead
of only predicting subsequent raw time series data. Another critical function that FinDL library
provides is a train, validation, and test split for time series data. We provide users with components
to extract subsequences from their time series data to create training and testing sets for model
evaluation.6 Gao Mo, Nathan Ng, Richard Tang, Zhiting Hu
Model
The deep learning models supported by FinDL include TreNet, LSTM, CNN, and GRU. TreNet
consists of two layers of 1D convolution, a relu nonlinearity layer, a maximum pooling layer, and
a dropout layer. The CNN stack takes raw stock price data points as inputs and returns the local
feature information as output. The long short-term memory structure consists of an LSTM layer and
a fully connected layer that returns historic trend features. The GRU structure functions similarly as
the LSTM structure. It is more time and memory efficient but generally performs better on smaller
datasets. Using both the outputs from the CNN stack model and the LSTM or GRU model, the
outputs are mapped to the same feature space and added element-wise in the feature fusion layer.
The sum of the outputs are then fed through a fully connected layer to return the next prediction.
All of these models can easily be used in conjunction, such as in a larger hybrid or ensemble
model, or swapped out using our modular design of these models. Most of the models can perform
similar tasks, and can easily be swapped with one line of code. This allows users to experiment with
different deep learning architectures and models without needing to deal with implementation or
changing other parts of the pipeline to adjust for the new model.
Training Executor and Model Evaluation
Lastly, FinDL also includes a general training executor to train models and functions to evaluate
model performance during training. The training executor component works independent of
whichever model design the user creates and task the model is designed to answer. This allows
users to freely create models using FinDL and easily train the models using our training executor.
Training parameters, such as optimizer, loss function, and training epochs can all be configured
and changed easily to allow for more effective model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning. Our
training executor works with any PyTorch optimization and loss functions, which gives users a
wide range of ways to optimize model training and performance, without needing to implement
any complex algorithm themselves. Additionally, FinDL includes a built in visualization component
to help users quickly plot losses per epoch during model training to see how well the model trained
and converged. All of these components help users build a pipeline using flexible components that
can be interchanged and fine tuned to maximize performance for time series tasks.
Results
Instead of implementing an entire deep learning pipeline from scratch, which requires extensive
knowledge in deep learning models and frameworks to implement effectively, users can easily build
their own pipelines using FinDL’s modularized components. FinDL reduces the amount of code
needed to create, train, and evaluate deep learning models by providing the tools needed to put
together a working pipeline. This allows users to focus more on model designs and fine-tuning
models, reducing the amount of time and resources people may spend on learning and using more
complex machine learning frameworks.
To demonstrate FinDL’s capabilities, we implement a deep learning pipeline using a TreNet
model using FinDL components. Using raw time series stock data from the New Stock Exchange
dataset, we convert this into trend durations and slope and prepare the data to be consumed by the
model. We then configure our TreNet model, choose an optimizer and loss function, and train
our model using FinDL’s training executor. Figure 4 shows the code we used to build and run the
pipeline.
In addition, we also created pipelines for CNN, LSTM, and TreNet and trained each model. For
the CNN and LSTM models, we used FinDL to create a pipeline to predict the next subsequent
stock price. For the TreNet model, we used FinDL to predict the next trend duration and slope.
We trained each model separately for 2000 epochs and plotted their losses per epoch using FinDL’s
visualization component.7

The resulting visualizations are plotted in figures 5, 6, and 7, with the blue line representing
training loss and the orange line representing validation, and we observed that each model converged
fairly quickly. In the TreNet model, the validation loss for predicting future trend data dropped from
0.6028 to 0.1504, and converged at the 1250th epoch. For the LSTM model, the validation loss when
predicting the next stock price dropped from 0.332 to 0.0518 and converged at the 1250th epoch.
Lastly, the CNN model had a validation model of 0.5342 which dropped to 0.0273, and converged
at the 500th epoch. By using components from FinDL, we were able to swap models and change
prediction tasks fairly easily with minimal amounts of changes.
Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced FinDL, a library that provides an end-to-end machine learning pipeline
for time series data related tasks in finance. Users have the ability to utilize state-of-the-art deep
learning models without significant machine learning experience and knowledge. FinDL provides
callable data loader and preprocessor functions, as well as time-series forecasting models and training
and evaluation functions. Users are able to implement the entire deep learning pipeline and generate
promising and consistent results with just a few lines of code using FinDL. In the future, we will
continue building upon the library that we have and implement more models and introduce additional
features to cover a wider range of deep learning prediction tasks in the finance domain.

1.  Abstract
In today’s digital environment, building a credible
professional reputation does not have many
infallible platforms or applications. Especially in
the service industry, it is hard to quantify tips,
customer sentiment, and experience to carry on in
a professional future. We created a user-friendly
interface using a QR code integration to easily,
digitally tip and rate using ethereum currency. We
also created interactive timesheets for employees
to enter hours worked. For the future, the usage of
the blockchain’s graph structure and timestamping
attribute will allow us to easily query data and
build a visualization dashboard for employees to
view their rating, tipping, and work hour history
and patterns. With the use of blockchain
technology’s immutable nature, network
timestamps, and persistence based chaining,
Servicechain.io presents a solution that can
enforce a transparent and credible reputation as an
employee. Our chain provides functionalities like
tipping and rating on a scale of 1-5 for customers
to leave honest feedback for service workers, as
well as a segmentation to allow individual
actors(companies) to create their respective
contracts for their employees. Servicechain.io uses
smart contracts to house core logic that interacts
with the ethereum blockchain. In addition to the
smart contract the app provides user-friendly
mappings of names to the public hashes of
users/organizations through a firebase backend.
The usage of the blockchain’s graph structure and
timestamping attribute allows us to easily query
data and build a visualization for employees to
view their rating, tipping, and work hour history
and patterns. For the future, the accruing of data
points such as hours or tips will allow for the
addition of NFT based goodwill rewards
incentivizing higher service ratings.
2. Introduction
Over the past fifty years, the advent of service
workers has grown more and more popular. In the
United States specifically, tipping culture has
increased and proven to be a steady flow of
income for service workers. With the growing
decentralization of society, it is imperative that a
decentralized solution to migrate service workers’
workflows exists. To provide a platform for
automated tipping as well as monitoring job
performance for service workers, we created
Servicechain.io an application that will allow
consumers to rate and tip service workers which
are automatically stored on a blockchain so
employers can identify and verify service workers'
performance in a transparent and equitable
manner. With a transparent and equitable
blockchain specifically tailored for service
workers, we envision a world in which an
employee’s reputation and credibility can be
derived from these transparent chains. In order to
further the utility of the application, we also added
the ability for service workers to log their hours
using Servicechain.io. With these hours
automatically stored on the Servicechain, we also
imagine that work experience can immediately be
verified for the sake of experience validation when
workers apply for other jobs. Although these
services can all be easily attained currently within
a centralized paradigm (through a mix of
applications such as Square (tipping and payment),
Yelp (rating), and Paycom (hours logging)),Servicechain uniquely decentralizes these various
services through the use of smart contracts.
Mixing together smart contracts (transaction
protocols on the blockchain) with a React based
front end, we aim to bridge together these various
services and bring decentralization to the service
industry.
3. Data Model
In the application of smart contracts, there is no
data heavy process that involves cleaning,
analysis, and modeling like many data driven
projects. Many smart contracts do not rely on any
data, and instead require data unique to users
which will grow as more and more users use the
product (the blockchain acquiring more data as
time goes on). This process is also often tested
through simulation and would not make use of a
preset dataset to begin with. Within the
Servicechain.io application, users data helps craft
the blockchain from which much of the value of
the application derives. That is, as more and more
users use the application, more data regarding
average tips, average ratings, and total hours
worked are available to the user in the application.
Creating user friendly interaction mechanisms, our
front end bridges the gap usability and complexity
of the blockchain.
4. Methods
For Servicechain.io, there are two primary smart
contracts that interact with a react based front end
to create the decentralized application (dAPP for
short). The first smart contract is the
Factory
smart
contract which enables companies to create
individually deployed contracts in which their
employees (service workers) can interact and input
their respective data. For example, restaurant A,
restaurant B, and restaurant C would each have
individual deployed contracts. In objective
oriented programming terms, one could think of
the smart contract as the class and each restaurant
as instances of this class.  The second contract is
the
Service
contract which enables the
functionality for the various services offered on
Servicechain.io such as tipping, rating, and
logging hours. These contracts work with a custom
built front end to enable the decentralized
application. The front end is built using React.js,
Next.js, as well as some basic Javascript. The
backend to allow for user mappings to public
addresses used firebase. Decentralized web
applications are hard to transition to and because
of this the app uses real time market data on
ethereum to convert prices into USD in order to
ease this transition by making use of aws Lambda
and the Gecko API endpoint.
Below is a figure that illustrates the architecture of
the application.
Fig 1.
Servicechain.io Architecture
The actors in this architecture include the
company, customer, and employee. The company
represents the employer for an employee (in a
service worker’s case most often is a restaurant).
The company has the primary responsibility of
setting up the instance of the factory contract
where most of the services will take place. After
setting up the individual instance for their
company, the company’s only continual interaction
is verifying the hours submitted by a given
employee. The second actor is the customer. A
customer scans a QR code presented by a service
worker to access Servicechain.io. The customer is
exposed to two primary functionalities that are
exposed from the
Service
contract: the tip and rate
functions. These functions allow the customer to
rate and tip the last actor of the application: the
employee (the service worker). The primary
interaction for an employee actor is the Log Hour
function, which allows employees to log their
hours worked on the Servicechain.io, so their total
hours worked is immutable and can immediately
be verified for future jobs. The employee actor
will also be able to view the tips as well as the
ratings they have received using the
Servicechain.io application. A more technical
description of both the
Factory
and
Service
contract as well as their respective functions are
expanded upon below.
In the Servicechain.io application there are
two contracts that work together with the react
front end that enable the functionality of the
application.
The first one is
Factory
, a parent contract
for the
Service
contract that creates individual
factory instances. There is only one primary
function within the
Factory
contract which allows
for initialization.
●
createService
is a function that creates an
instance of the
Service
contract for a given
instance of the
Factory
contract. This
allows the data for a specific “factory”
(company) to be separate from other
companies and enables the blockchain to
be less cluttered with simultaneous
amounts of transactions occurring.
The second contract is
Service
which
enables the set of services that empower the
application which includes the functions
submitTip, sendRatings, getRatings, enterHours,
and getTotalHours.
●
submitTip
is a function that allows
customers to transfer money from their
wallet to the wallet of the employee.
●
sendRatings
allow a customer to give a
rating to an employee
●
getRatings
allow an employee to view the
average ratings they have received from
customers.
●
enterHours
allow an employee to enter
their current hours worked for an arbitrary
time frame
●
getTotalHours
allow an employee to view
their total hours they have worked since
they started using the system.
These six functions represent the core
functionalities of our decentralized web
application and  allow us to create a service based
application on the blockchain.
5. Results
Servicechain.io is an entry point to the power of
blockchain technology and smart contracts in the
service industry and a potential solution to the
many flaws that come up within it by providing an
ecosystem amongst customers, employees, and
employers. Servicechain.io has the ability to
deliver finances and data directly to the user
without the need of a single authority by utilizing
the distributed ledger provided by the ethereum
network. This allows employers to see quantifiable
impact by their employees by being exposed to
low level details of their hours,ratings, and tips. It
allows employees to not only be compensated but
build a reputation of their hard work through the
feature of ratings and tipping mechanisms built in
the app. Customers are exposed to a  more
convenient way to impact businesses and transfer
finances by utilizing direct customer to
employee/employer deposits and ratings. All ofthis while being transparent and secure because of
the blockchain network.","Servicechain.io is a decentralized application that aims to empower service workers by providing a platform for automated tipping, rating, and monitoring job performance. It uses blockchain technology to create transparent and credible reputations for employees. The application allows customers to rate and tip service workers using ethereum currency, and employees can log their hours worked. The data collected on the blockchain can be used to visualize rating, tipping, and work hour history. Servicechain.io also plans to incentivize higher service ratings through NFT-based goodwill rewards. The application consists of two smart contracts that interact with a React-based front end. Overall, Servicechain.io provides a decentralized solution for the service industry by combining various services such as tipping, rating, and logging hours into one platform."

Abstract
Subreddit recommendation is a powerful tool that can enhance
user experiences and improve user churn and engagement for
Reddit. Reddit currently employs algorithms for subreddit
recommendation; however, we seek to improve upon this
recommendation system by selecting a graph-based machine
learning algorithm to suggest subreddits to users through com-
munity detection along with user interactions. We implement
tools from TigerGraph to examine various ways of represent-
ing these interactions between Reddit users as features to
guide our analysis.
1 Introduction
Social media has become the most important way for people
to access information, connect with friends, and expand
businesses. Around 70 percent of all Americans use social
media to connect with each other and share information [4].
The social media platform Reddit is a massive collection
of forums where users can share news and content. Reddit
is made up of more than a million communities known
as subreddits; each subreddit consists of a different topic
or interest. Users in these subreddits can make posts and
comments to interact with other users, essentially forming
communities with specific interests. As of 2022, Reddit has
50 million daily active Reddit users worldwide [6]. Reddit
users are often recommended subreddits based on those they
have visited or interacted with.
We decide to explore graph-based representations of
data for good reason. Graph theory has existed for decades,
but advancements in computing power and introduction of
large-scale graph databases like TigerGraph have allowed
applications of graph algorithms to a wide range of domains.
Traditional data methods, like representing data in tabular
format, are less effective in representing complex relation-
ships; rows are observations, columns are variables. This can
be limiting for data that has many associated variables andcomplex relationships, as tabular data is less effective. We
believe that user-subreddit and user-user relationships would
be better represented as graphs, which makes representation
more flexible. Especially for Reddit, like many other social
media platforms, their comment representation is a tree
structure where separate replies to a comment are branches,
which is well represented by graphs.
We can think of conversation in one of these trees as a
comment chain, that is, a set of comments where each one
(apart from the first comment) is a reply to one preceding it.
We will investigate the typical size, shape and diversity of
users in each of these chains. From a business point of view,
the impact of this task would be in user acquisition and user
retention. For current users, this would help expose them to
subreddits they may be interested in, decreasing the likelihood
of churn. For newer users without a few established subreddit
communities they are a part of, immediately exposing them
to similar communities may be beneficial in making them
recurring users rather than one-time users. From a graph
perspective, this problem is worth investigating as it can
evaluate the relevancy of user interactions in a graph-like
comment interaction structure as a basis for recommendation
systems. We use a graph-based machine learning algorithm
that assists in recommending subreddits to users based on
their interactions with other users in subreddits through
comment chains.
Previous work has been done in the space of subreddit
recommendations. In one attempt, a subreddit-to-subreddit
interest network was built, where two subreddits are
connected if a large portion of one subreddit’s members
are also active in the other [7]. The model they build is
based K-means clustering. These examples along with others
are not necessarily graph-based. Where graph community
detection tasks of subreddits are used, the graphs are
represented in relatively simple ways, primarily incorporating
user and subreddit subscription relationships and using
that data to make recommendations using ""non-graphy""criteria such as similarity scores like Jaccard [1]. By
contrast, we look to use additional information which can
be represented as graphs such as interactions between
different users within subreddits in an attempt to leverage
that interaction information as an indicator of user’s affinity
for different communities/subreddits. We aim to use col-
laborative filtering encoded within our algorithm with user
interactions to then accurately recommend subreddits to users.
In order to create an algorithm ourselves, we use a dataset
provided and maintained by Jason Baumgartner which can be
downloaded via their website pushshift.io at its data directory
subdomain. There, data for Reddit users, subreddits, posts
and comments among other things are hosted in monthly
time increments going back to Reddit’s inception in 2005.
In order to ensure we didn’t face any hardware limitations,
we opted to use all comments prior to 2011 (2005 - Dec.
2010). However, because the data across all time periods is
formatted in the same way, our work could easily be scaled
up simply by downloading and using the more recent files.
From it, we build a graph with 2 different types of nodes and
2 types of edges. Our 2 nodes are: User nodes and Subreddit
nodes. Our first edge, interacted_with, connects users who
interacted with other users. Secondly, the commented_in
edge connects users to subreddits they have interacted in via
comments.
Using the data from the source above, we create the datasets
as listed below:
Dataset Name Contents
Users-Users Connects users who interacted with one another
Users-Subreddits Connects users to subreddits they have commented in
Subreddits All Subreddits in the dataset and their keyword embeddings
Users All users in the dataset and their keyword embeddings
All of the edges in this dataset are undirected, meaning
that the relationship between any edge (vi,vj)in the graph is
mutual. In total, our graph contains ∼172 ,000total vertices
and∼1,200 ,000edges. In a bit more detail, the graph con-
tains 2,929unique subreddit vertices, and ∼170 ,000user
vertices along with ∼865 ,000""interacted_with"" edges and
∼345 ,000 ""commented_in"" edges.
In particular, this dataset allows us to make this evaluation
on a network like the one that can be derived from Reddit.
That is, one which encodes information about the interac-
tion of users with other users within pre-defined communities.
However, as many social media platforms use very similar
representations for the links between users, this data can hope-
fully allow us to make more broad claims about social graphs
and their usefulness in making predictions about users pre-
ferred communities.2 Methodologies
2.1 Data Preparation
In order to fully leverage the graph structure of our data, we
use TigerGraph, a graph analytics platform which provides
a myriad of tools and resources for graph-based data science
and machine learning, making it a valuable solution for us.
The data we downloaded from pushshift, each comment is
given in the same format as the following example:
{
""author"": ""RaptorLog"",
""author_flair_css_class"": """",
""author_flair_text"": ""ro ru "",
""body"": ""Oh, I have been going crazy..."",
""can_gild"": true,
""controversiality"": 0,
""created_utc"": 1506816002,
""distinguished"": null,
""edited"": false,
""gilded"": 0,
""id"":""dnqik36"",
""is_submitter"": true,
""link_id"": ""t3_73g6fg"",
""parent_id"": ""t1_dnqf2cj"",
""permalink"": ""/r/duolingo/comments/73g6fg/..."",
""retrieved_on"": 1509189607,
""score"": 32,
""stickied"": false,
""subreddit"": ""duolingo"",
""subreddit_id"": ""t5_2t6ze""
}
There is a lot of interesting data here, but we are most in-
terested in the user who made the comment, the subreddit
it was posted to and the parent comment if any. Due to the
fact that any comment on Reddit is either a child of a post
of another comment, we can use this parent relationship to
generate the comment chain graph structure we will set up
in TigerGraph. We then use the author field to create edges
between user vertices identified by those author names and
the comment IDs as well as subreddit to comment edges using
the subreddit name as an identifier for the subreddit vertices.
Once we have the correct files specifying those vertices and
edges, we simply use TigerGraph’s tools for uploading and
mapping the data to generate our graph.
After loading our data to TigerGraph, we develop a schema
that looks like so:
Subreddit Usercommented_in
interacted_with
This schema consists of two vertex types (Subreddit, User)
and 2 edge types (interacted_with, commented_in).
22.2 Data Analysis
Once we prepare and load our data, we do some exploratory
data analysis to better understand the data we are working
with and find interesting aspects of the data that could poten-
tially be feature engineered. First, we look into some more
general statistics like the top 10 largest subreddits with the
most unique users:
Figure 1: Top 10 subreddits
with Unique Users
Looking at Figure 1, subreddits that seem more broad and
common like ’gaming’ and ’pics’ are in the top 10 subreddits.
Since they are broad, it is more likely that users will join these
and be interested in these subreddits. In Figure 2, we look into
the distribution of the number of comments made by users:
Figure 2: Distribution of number of comments made by users
We see that 27% of users have made 1 comment, 41% of
users have made between 2 and 10 comments, and 31% of
users have made more than 10 comments.
Next, we look into the karma of users. On Reddit, karma is
a score of a user/comment that is determined by the sum of
all upvotes minus the sum of all downvotes, usually displayedpublicly next to the upvote and downvote buttons. First we
look into the average karma for a comment by subreddit:
Figure 3: Average Karma for a Comment by Subreddit
In Figure 3, we can see that most of these subreddits have
an average karma for comments in the subreddit between 0
and 3. Next, we look into the average karma for a comment
by user:
Figure 4: Average Karma for a Comment by User
In Figure 4, we see that once again, a large majority of users
have an average karma between 0 and 5 for their comments.
Finally, we also analyze the distribution of users by karma:
3Figure 5: Distribution of Users by Karma
Figure 5 shows that a majority of users have between 1 and
100 karma associated with their accounts, while few users
have negative karma.
After this, we aim to look at the volume of comments by
day. From our dataset, we find that the majority of comments
are made in the month of December. Looking at Figure 6:
Figure 6: V olume of Comments by Day (December)
This doesn’t give us much insight into larger trends over
the course of longer periods of time, but we do see that for the
most part, there are several days where the volume of com-
ments seems to be relatively similar to one another, meaning
that there does not seem to be a special relationship between
day of month and number of comments.
Finally, we delve a bit deeper into comment chains, as that
is where the biggest focus of our model is. We find that we
have 942,558 comment chains in our data. Figure 7 shows the
distribution of comment chain lengths.
Figure 7: Distribution of Comment Chain Lengths
From Figure 7, we can see that the majority of comments
do not actually belong to a comment chain. This means that
the comment was posted and no-one replied. These data are
likely not very useful in generating meaningful metrics for
recommendation based on user comment interactions.
However, 45% of the comment data are part of chains with
41% being ’small’ chains of only 2 - 10 comments and the
other 4% being long chains with over 10 comments. We can
examine the distributions of both of these groups:
Figure 8: Distribution of Comment Chain Lengths (2-10 and
10+)
As we might expect, we generally have less chains of longer
lengths. In short, there are mostly smaller chains in the data
but the distribution is heavily right-skewed due to some very
long chains.
Now we look at some data such as the number of users in
each chain and the number of times users tend to interact in a
chain. Figure 9 details the number of unique users per chain:
4Figure 9: Distribution of Unique Users in Chains
Next, we look at the ratio between the number of unique
users in a chain and the total number of comments in that
chain. This tells us how unique the set of users participating
in a chain is. Smaller ratios means there is less diversity. We
find that the chains are generally quite diverse as, on average,
the number of unique users is very close to the total number
of comments. However, because we are including chains of
length one which the ration is guaranteed to be 1.0 for, this
value is quite skewed. We remove those and try again:
Minimum Number
in chaincount mean std min
1 428186.0 0.864 0.202 0.016
2 203798.0 0.829 0.202 0.016
3 117313.0 0.811 0.197 0.016
4 76377.0 0.800 0.191 0.016
5 54273.0 0.793 0.186 0.016
6 40719.0 0.788 0.181 0.074
7 32033.0 0.784 0.176 0.085
8 25871.0 0.781 0.173 0.085
9 21444.0 0.779 0.17 0.085
10 18123.0 0.777 0.166 0.085
This is more indicative of the data we wanted to see. Now,
as we move towards larger and larger chains, the average
ratio of unique users seems to plataeu at 0.78 as indicated by
Figure 10.
Figure 10: Average Ratio of Unique Users in Chains
After completing our EDA, we aim to develop baseline
models for community detection so as to compare these to our
final model. We develop baseline models: K-Nearest Neigh-
bors, a recommender system using Jaccard similarity, and a
simple popularity prediction model. These baselines are not
necessarily graph-based, but they help us to set and measure
the baseline to then build upon for our final model.
1.The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm we develop uses
cosine similarity as the metric, and chooses 20 neighbors.
Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between
two data points in a plane, and in a KNN is used to
determine the distance between two points. This can be
found mathematically as follows:
cos(θ) =A·B
||A||||B||(1)
where AandBare two vectors of attributes.
2.The recommender system we develop uses Jaccard sim-
ilarity to recommend subreddits to users. The Jaccard
index is used to gauge the similarity and diversity of sets,
and can be determined mathematically as follows:
J(A,B) =|A∩B|
|A∪B|=|A∩B|
|A|+|B|−|A∩B|(2)
3.A final baseline we tried was a simple popularity
predictor model, which recommends users the most
popular subreddits that they are not already subscribed
to.
We then build simple models in TigerGraph to calculate
several different metrics based on our graph network:
5•Closeness for Users: a measure of the average farness
(inverse distance) to all other user nodes. Nodes with
a high closeness score have the shortest distance to all
other nodes. The closeness of a node xis determined by:
C(x) =N−1
∑yd(y,x)(3)
where Nis the number of nodes in the graph, and d(y,x)
is the length of the shortest path between user vertices x
and y.
•Betweenness for Users: This is a measure of the percent-
age of shortest paths to other users that must go through
a specific user node. A user node with high betweenness
is likely to be aware of what is going on in multiple
circles. The equation for betweenness of a given node u
is:
B(u) =∑
u̸=v̸=wσv,w(u)
σ(v,w)(4)
where σv,wis the total number of shortest paths from
node vto node w, andσv,w(u)is the total number of
shortest paths from node vto node wthat pass through
u.
•Eigenvector for Users: eigenvector centrality is a mea-
sure of the influence of a node in a network. A high score
means that a node is connected to many nodes who have
high scores. For a given graph G:= (V,E)with|V|ver-
tices, where A= (av,t)is the adjacency matrix (i.e. (av,t)
= 1 if the vertex v is linked to vertex t and 0 otherwise.).
We can find the eigenvector centrality using:
Ax=λx (5)
•Degree Centrality for Users: The number of edges a user
node has. The higher the degree, the more central this
user is.
•Degree Centrality for Comments: The number of edges
a comment node has. The higher the degree, the more
central this comment is.
•PageRank for Comments: PageRank counts the number
and quality of links to a comment to determine how im-
portant that comment is, assuming that that comment is
more likely to receive more connections to other com-
ments.
•PageRank for Users: PageRank counts the number and
quality of links to a comment to determine how impor-
tant that comment is, assuming that that comment is more
likely to receive more connections to other comments.
We want to use a combination of these metrics in our fi-
nal algorithm to best model user interactions. We then useTigerGraph to build the Louvain algorithm and the Label
propagation algorithm, which are two community detection
algorithms.
• Louvain Algorithm:
Louvain is a greedy community detection algo-
rithm that focuses on optimizing modularity, which
measures the relative density of edges inside com-
munities with respect to edges outside communities.
By optimizing modularity, Louvain results in the
best possible grouping of nodes of a given network.
In Louvain, small communities are first found by
optimizing modularity locally on all nodes, then each
small community is grouped into one node and the first
step is repeated [5]. The value modularity, Qis defined
as:
Q=1
2m∑
i j[Ai j−kikj
2m]δ(ci,cj) (6)
where Ai jrepresents the edge weight between nodes i
andj,kiandkjare the sum of the weights of the edges
attached to the nodes i and j, respectively. mis the sum
of all the edge weights in the graph, ciandcjare the
communities of the nodes, and δis the Kronecker delta
function ( δ(x,y) =1 ifx=y, 0 otherwise) [3]
• Label Propagation Algorithm:
The Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) is a fast
algorithm for finding communities in a graph. The LPA
works by propagating labels throughout the network
and forming communities based on this process. The
intuition behind this algorithm is that a single label
can quickly become dominant in a densely connected
group of nodes, but will have trouble crossing a sparsely
connected region. Labels will get trapped inside a
densely connected group of nodes, and those nodes that
end up with the same label when the algorithms finish
can be considered part of the same community [2]. LPA
works as follows:
–Every node is initialized with a unique community
label, an identifier.
–These labels propagate through the network.
–At every iteration of propagation, each node up-
dates its label to the one that the maximum number
of its neighbors belongs to. Ties are broken arbi-
trarily but deterministically.
–LPA reaches convergence when each node has the
majority label of its neighbors.
–LPA stops if either convergence, or the user-defined
maximum number of iterations is achieved.
6Our final model is a Network Statistics Model, which is a
combination of algorithms previously listed with tuned hy-
perparameters, to ensure an optimized and comprehensive
final model. An embedding is created for every user in the
graph which consists of a combination of graph based features
and standard machine learning features. For the graph based
features, the network statistics model calculates a PageRank,
Degree, Louvain, and Label Propagation score for each user
node. These four scores represents how influential a user is,
how active a user is based on number of interactions, what
community a user belongs to based on Louvain, and what
community a user belongs to based on LPA respectively.
To build the standard machine learning features, we first
create a corpus of text for every user using all of the comments
that user has posted. We then find the top 25 most influen-
tial words from that corpus by applying TFIDF and picking
the top 25 highest scoring words. Then we use a pre-trained
word2vec model which converts each of the 25 keywords
into an embedding of length 50. This then gives each user
an embedding of size 25 X 50, representing the keywords
that the user is interested in. Combining the graph based fea-
tures with the standard features results in each user having
an embedding of size 1254. Using this size 1254 embedding,
K-Nearest Neighbors is utilized to calculate the two most sim-
ilar users to the input user. We then create a pool of possible
subreddits to recommend. This pool consists of subreddits
that the two neighboring users are active in that the input
user isn’t already interacting in. In order to determine what
subreddits to recommend from this pool, we use a similar
approach to our standard machine learning feature pipeline.
For every subreddit node, we create a corpus which consists
of text extracted from 25 randomly picked comments made
in that subreddit. We follow the same process as above by
picking 25 keywords for each subreddit using TFIDF scores.
Same as above, we apply a pre-trained word2vec model to the
keywords to create 25 X 50 size embeddings for each subred-
dit. We then train another K-Nearest Neighbors model on the
pool of possible subreddits that we created earlier. From there,
we iterate through the subreddits the user has already inter-
acted in and use K-Nearest Neighbors to find the five most
similar subreddits from the pool. These similar subreddits
will be the recommendations that we output to the user. If the
number of recommendations is greater than the total number
of unique subreddits in the possible recommendation pool,
the network statistics model uses the Popular Recommender
to fill in those missing recommendations.
3 Results
We find that we run into a very common problem that many
people face when trying to evaluate unsupervised recom-
mender system models: how can we successfully evaluate
our recommender system if there are no truth labels to com-
pare to?After researching several different methods, we decide to
use Precision@k as our evaluation metric. Precision@k is
the proportion of the recommended items in the top-k set of
recommendations that are relevant.
Precision@k =# of recommended items @k that are relevant
# of recommended items @k(7)
We calculate these values by pulling data from 1 year in the
future from the training data and examining all the Subreddits
the training users interact in that they did not interact in before.
Precision quantifies how well the recommendations we make
match those true interactions. Our results are below:
Algorithm Graph-Based? @1 @3 @5 @10 @25
Popularity Recommender No 0.1000 0.0944 0.0729 0.0475 0.0251

Table 1: Precision@k results for all models (scores are aver-
ages across users)
Table 1 shows our results at different values of k; specifi-
cally, when @k is 1, 3, 5, 10, and 25.
When @k is 10 and 25, our final model outperforms stan-
dard recommendation techniques. However, our model fails
to surpass standard models when @k is 1, 3, or 5. We believe
that this under-performance may be due to the bias of users
only interacting in the most popular subreddits at the time
and not exploring new and upcoming subreddits based on
their personal interests. As we mentioned earlier, our model
was trained on data from 2010, when Reddit was relatively
new and most user interactions were happening in the most
popular subreddits. This is why we see such a successful
precision@k for our popularity recommender that just recom-
mends the most popular subreddits in the data set that a user
is not already part of.

4 Conclusion
Our project showcases the potential of graph-based recom-
mendations, which are a relatively new concept in compar-
ison to decades-old tried-and-true methods like K-nearest
7neighbors. However, the ability for graphs to handle complex
relationships, as well as increased efficiency in data storage
and computation for graphs creates a huge advantage, and
the increased metrics from our final model definitely demon-
strate the effectiveness of interaction graph-based recommen-
dations for Reddit. Our project’s emphasizes the importance
of adopting newer and advanced techniques to keep up with
the evolving landscape of machine learning and data science.
As technology advances, we believe that graph-based recom-
mendations will continue to play a significant role in shaping
future recommendation systems.
While our project has highlighted the benefits of graph-
based recommendations over traditional methods, there are
still many potential applications of these techniques and al-
gorithms that could still be explored. Applications that could
be explored in the future include graph-based and interaction-
based recommendation on other social media networks, such
as Twitter or Facebook, where potential communities or top-
ics can be recommended instead. In our project, we used a
smaller subset of data from earlier years (before 2011) as oth-
erwise graph sizes would be too large. For expansions done
to this project in particular, we could use a much more recent
Reddit dataset from past 2020 in order to overcome the bias
of popular subreddits, as data from earlier days of the website
represents a much smaller amount of communities compared
to today’s amount. We hypothesize that our model will have
greatly improved results when trained on more recent data.
We could explore further algorithms within TigerGraph and
keep tuning the hyperparameters for the algorithms to ensure
the optimal precision@k.

Abstract
Blockchain technology is a quickly growing field, helped greatly through
its widespread applications in the financial field. However, the space has
been under attack through phishing fraud, posing itself as a major threat
to blockchain security. According to the FTC, cryptocurrency scams have
cost online users over $1 Billion since 2021; there is a clear demand for
the development of effective fraud detection strategies to prevent and
detect cybercrimes. With access to Ethereum transaction networks, we
can model and train phishing detection as a node classification problem.
With graph-based machine learning approaches, we can more effectively
flag fraudulent activity in Ethereum networks and reduce the amount of
phishing activity with Ethereum, and improve user experience with safer
transactions as blockchain technology gains even more traction.
1 Introduction
Blockchain technology allows for the process of recording transactions and
tracking assets between two parties without a third party. Recently, many
applications have been using blockchain technology, exchanging cryptocurrency
such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the amount of phishing scams, money
laundering, and other cybercrimes have risen within these blockchain platforms.
These crimes are difficult to investigate and identify the offender due to the high
frequency of transactions. Traditionally, banks are utilized as the third party or
intermediary to constantly monitor and check when a new account is opened or
suspicious transactions are made. However, in our case with blockchain, people
are easily able to create wallets and make transactions freely, thus creating
the concern that it may be difficult to check for suspicious or crime-related
1transactions. Due to the nature of blockchain technology, transaction information
is held public and anyone can attain this information, but this may not be
sufficienttodetectsuspiciousactivity. Asblockchainandcryptocurrencybecomes
more popular, the number of transactions and wallets increase also, causing
detection of suspicious transactions to be more difficult and time-consuming.
Due to the potential cybercrimes that may occur from blockchain, many
studies have been conducted to detect suspicious transactions in expansive
financial networks. Some of these studies have utilized timestamps, incidental
expenses, or the number of transactions as their features for their models. In
addition, somestudieshavealsoutilizedgraphembeddingsformodeloptimization
and evaluation of fraud detection. However, there are only a few studies out
that have been conducted using graph neural network (GNN) models. Recently,
a deep learning approach graph convolution algorithm has been popularized to
automatically generate features using nodes and edges of graphs. The Graph
Convolutional Model (GCN) applies neural network models to graph data, and
it learns by updating feature values of each node and edge based on the graph
structure.
In our study, we will use public Ethereum transaction networks as our graph
data, and we will examine GNN in comparison to multiple other traditional
models to determine the most effective method in detecting phishing fraud
transactions. To achieve this, a graph is first constructed from the Ethereum
transaction data, then we incorporate graph models such as GCN, GraphSage,
and Graph Attention Network (GAT). The performance of these models is then
compared to traditional models such as XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Our source code is available here.

1.1 Why Graph?
Networks are a type of graph-structured data which is often used to describe
the relationship between objects. Recently, there’s been an explosive growth
in utilizing network data to model interactions and represent data in social
networks, biological systems, supply chain networks, and financial transactions.
Network embedding is a technique that represents graph nodes in a network as
dense and low-dimensional vectors, while preserving their structural information
and relationships. The goal is to capture the latent features and patterns of
the network, which can be used for various downstream tasks such as node
classification, link prediction, and clustering. The process involves training a
machine learning model on the network data and generating embeddings that
minimize the difference between predicted and observed edges or node attributes.
Network embeddings have various applications and can help uncover hidden
patterns and insights in the network data.
Modeling fraud detection in Ethereum transaction networks as a graph
machine learning task can be achieved with TigerGraph NoSQL graph databases.
TigerGraph allows us to store our Ethereum transaction network as a graph
2with defined schemas for nodes (wallets) and edges (transactions). Additionally
TigerGraph’s proprietary graph query language, GSQL, enables computation of
graph analytics with scalable queries. In our project, we utilized TigerGraph as
a database to store our transaction network as a graph, conducted exploratory
data analysis using GSQL queries, and engineered nodes with additional graph
features by calculating summary statistics of transaction amounts (maximum,
minimum, sum, average), indegree and outdegree, and pagerank.
1.2 Data Description
The dataset contains transaction records of 445 phishing accounts and 445 non-
phishing accounts of Ethereum. We obtain 445 phishing accounts labeled by
Etherscan and the same number of randomly selected unlabeled accounts as
our objective nodes. The dataset can be used to conduct node classification of
financial transaction networks.
We collect the transaction records based on an assumption that for a typical
money transfer flow centered on a phishing node, the previous node of the
phishing node may be a victim, and the next one to three nodes may be the
bridge nodes with money laundering behaviors, as figure shows. Therefore, we
collect subgraphs by K-order sampling with K-in = 1, K-out = 3 for each of the
890 objective nodes and then splice them into a large-scale network with 86,623
nodes and 106,083 edges.
The dataset can be downloaded from XBlock, one of the largest blockchain
data platforms that collects current mainstream blockchain data and has the
widest coverage in the academic community.

Classification
31.3 Processing
We define fraud detection in Ethereum transaction networks as a node classifica-
tion problem. We will represent the transaction network as a graph where nodes
represent wallets/accounts and edges represent transactions between accounts.
Each node in the network has the following features: id, indegree, outdegree,
minimum sent, minimum sent, total sent, average sent, minimum received, maxi-
mum received, total received, average received, pagerank and label. Each edge in
the network has one associated feature, the transaction timestamp. The labelled
transaction data were split into 80% training and 20% testing sets. Our goal is
to learn a function mapping node attributes to a label associated with account
identity, whether the target account is fraudulent or not.
2 Methods
2.1 SVM
Our group started off with a support vector machine model (SVM) to act as
our first non-graph model. This is a supervised machine learning algorithm
with the objective to find the most optimal hyperplane that can best separate
data points of different classes in an N-dimensional space (N being the # of
features). Each transaction is represented as a vector, with each feature of the
transaction (sent_eth, received_eth, pagerank) as a dimension in space. It then
identifies the features that are most important for separating fraudulent and
non-fraudulent transactions and finds the hyperplane that best separates the
two classes. Because this is a supervised learning approach, we filtered out the
unlabelled data and achieved an accuracy of ∼60.5%with this classification
model.
2.2 KNN
Our second non-graph approach is a K-Nearest Neighbors model, where the
features of each transaction are utilized to create a feature vector. The distance
is then calculated between each feature vector of the test set and the existing
feature vectors of the training set. The nearest transactions based on the smallest
distances are identified and its label (fraudulent or non-fraudulent) is determined
by its neighbors. For this algorithm, we achieved an average accuracy of ∼74.6%,
which is higher than our first baseline using SVM.
2.3 XGBoost
For our last non-graph approach, we decided to use XGBoost (Extreme Gradient
Boosting), which is an ensemble method that combines weak decision trees to
create a stronger predictive model (boosting technique). This algorithm works
by iteratively building decision trees and adjusting the weights of the transaction
4edges to minimize loss. XGBoost obtained an average accuracy of ∼81.6%, which
is higher than some of the traditional and graph models we implemented.
2.4 Node2Vec
Node2vec as an algorithm solves the problem of transforming the information
inherent within a network into a workable numeric representation by transforming
each node into a vector. The first step in this process is done through a random
walk algorithm. In our case, the edges between the nodes are given weights
corresponding to the transaction amount between accounts. These weights
are used to simulate random paths between nodes from the network. In the
next step, the skip-gram model works with these paths to learn and creates a
node embedding for each node. How this is done is that it reads the random
paths taken, and learns which nodes are likely to precede another node. These
embeddings then allow us to determine the makings of a fraudulent account. We
achieved the best results through the pytorch implementation, with roughly a
∼76.6%accuracy on the test set. The pytorch package allows us to make use
of the large amount of unsupervised nodes present in our dataset, improving
performance.
2.5 GraphSage
GraphSage is most known for its inductive nature which allows it to better
adapt to previously unseen nodes. In a setting like Ethereum transaction
networks where the network evolves with new nodes and edges every day, there
would be a benefit to using a model that does not have to be retrained every
time new information is introduced. Additionally, in comparison to methods
like node2vec, GraphSage has the advantage of being able to learn from node
features. GraphSage works by starting at a node and aggregating information on
its neighbors to generate the embeddings. The pytorch package for this model
produced an accuracy of ∼81.9%, a noticeable upgrade compared to node2vec.
This difference can be attributed to the fact that in a largely unsupervised
dataset, an inductive approach may outperform the deductive approach.
2.6 GCN
We worked with GCNs in our first quarter on our Clickbait Detection algorithm
with TextGCN and we have implemented a version for this task as well. Much
of the structure is the same; we create an adjacency matrix based on the edges
of the network then propagate steps forwards (3 in our case) then form node
embeddings based on these. From there, we can iterate through the nodes and
update the node features by hashing the features of each neighboring node. The
GCN model from pytorch produced an accuracy of ∼79.6%.
52.7 Graph Attention Network
We also tested the performance of Graph Attention Networks (GAT). GATs
are a type of graph neural network that leverages masked self-attention which
addresses the shortcomings of prior methods based on graph convolutions or their
approximations. With GATs, we are able to extract meaningful node features
by implicitly specifying different weights got different nodes in a neighborhood,
without requiring costly matrix operations nor knowing the underlying graph
structure upfront. GAT outperformed GCN and GraphSAGE on node classifica-
tion tasks on the Cora dataset, so we hypothesized that this model may have
similar performance on our dataset compared to other models. The GAT model
from pytorch produced an accuracy of ∼78.5%, and slightly underperformed
compared to GCN and GraphSAGE.
2.8 Adaptive - GCN
The final model we evaluated was Topology Adaptive GCN (TA-GCN). TA-GCN
is a graph neural network defined in the vertex domain and outperforms many
spectral graph convolutional neural networks (CNNs). TA-GCN utilizes a set of
fixed-size learnable filters to perform convolutions on graphs. The topologies of
these filters are adaptive to the graph’s topology when scanned for convolutions.
TA-GCN inherits the properties of convolutions in CNNs for grid structured
data, yet doesn’t require approximation to compute the convolution, leading to
greater performance relative to spectral CNNs. TA-GCN is also computationally
simpler than other graph neural networks. Additionally TA-GCN tends to
achieve comparable or better accuracy than GCN and GraphSAGE for datasets
with larger and sparser graph structures. We hypothesized that the sparsity of
our transaction network will be beneficial for TA-GCNs performance in our node
classification prediction task. We implemented a TA-GCN model using pytorch,
which produced an accuracy of ∼82.2%, outperforming all of our models for
comparison.
3 Results
We conducted a comparative model performance evaluation experiment using
graph and non-graph models to detect phishing fraud accounts against an
Ethereum transaction network. Graph-based features improve overall model
performance for both graph-based and non-graph-based models. Graph neural
networks, specifically TA-GCN, performed best in the fraud detection task, as
GNNs are able to learn the networks’ structural information.
Model performance was determined by taking the average classification accu-
racy on the testing set over 10 model runs. The resulting classifier performance
for this prediction task are shown in Table 1 and the most important features for
predicting fraudulent wallets are total_recv and min_recv, shown in Figure 2.

4 Discussion
From our results, we found that the effectiveness of these algorithms depend on
the models being used. For instance, we formed a hypothesis on why TA-GCN
performed the best. The graph convolution of TA-GCN is characterized by
multiplying polynomials of the graph adjacency matrix without any involved
approximations, while traditional GCN models are based on approximating
the convolution. Our performance improvements stem from the fact that we
accurately capture the underlying graph structure without approximations during
the convolution operation. In addition, filter topology is adaptive to the topology
of the graph when scanning the graph to perform convolution, which allows for a
better understanding and learning of the graph structure. This is in contrast to
traditional GCN, which relies on fixed filters. Lastly, TA-GCN is computationally
simpler and exhibits better performance when dealing with less sparse graphs.
7Given that our transaction network is not particularly sparse, this suggests that
TA-GCN is well-suited for our network and may perform particularly well.
In addition, our hypothesis regarding why XGBoost performed better than
some GNNs is based on several factors. Firstly, XGBoost has the ability to
learn from unlabelled data, taking advantage of all the training data similar
to the GNN models we chose, thus improving predictive power. Additionally,
XGBoost includes an early stopping feature that can help lessen the risk of
overfitting, by stopping the training process once the model’s performance begins
to worsen. However, XGBoost tends to perform worse when dealing with sparse
data and imbalanced data. Fortunately, our transaction network is not sparse
and our training set is not imbalanced, which means that XGBoost is not at a
disadvantage in these regards.
Lastly, GNN models performed better than traditional models due to their
ability to utilize the full training set of unlabelled data. KNN and SVM, for
example, require all labeled data or nodes for training, which can limit their
effectiveness. GNNs, on the other hand, are able to leverage both labeled and
unlabeled data, improving their ability to learn from the full training set.
5 Conclusion
From our experiment, we found that graph networks are a more powerful tool for
modeling complex relationships in comparison to traditional non-graph models.
Evaluating and improving machine learning models can have a significant impact
on the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection. Better models can detect
more subtle patterns of fraudulent activity or reduce false positive rates, where
real transactions are incorrectly flagged as fraudulent, improving the overall
effectiveness to correctly detect fraudulent behavior. Improving these graph
models can offer advantages such as minimizing financial losses for people using
Ethereum and developing trust in the Ethereum ecosystem. Furthermore, since
Ethereum is a constantly growing platform, it’s essential to constantly evaluate
and update machine learning models to prevent new types of fraud and adapt
to changes in blockchain, ensuring the security and integrity of Ethereum. For
future work, we may explore other types of algorithms that require different data
structures and perhaps combine existing models to develop a model for specific
tasks in blockchain.
6 Appendix
Blockchain technology has been growing in use through its widespread appli-
cations in the financial field. However, it has recently attracted increasing
cybercrimes with phishing fraud emerging as a major threat to blockchain secu-
rity. With graph-based machine learning approaches, we can more effectively
flag fraudulent activity in Ethereum networks, to reduce the amount of phish-
ing activity with Ethereum, and increase user trust with safe transactions as
8blockchain technology gains widespread adoption. This problem is similar to our
Quarter 1 project in that we are attempting to classify nodes from a network
of nodes and edges. However, in Quarter 1 our project required text to be
present in the data since we were using TextGCN to classify the nodes. This
quarter, our project will not require any text and will rely more heavily on
the weights on the edges between nodes in the form of transaction amount.
We aim to achieve a high accuracy while working with less information per
node-edge than before. There have been some similar analyses in the past, most
notably by one of our mentors, Parker Erickson, who has done some analyses
into fraud detection using TigerGraph with Graph Attention Networks. However,
we propose that we use a richer selection of models and pull more meaningful
features from our dataset. We extracted additional node features using GSQL
queries by utilizing our dataset’s multigraph structure. We computed features of
in-degree and out-degree, weighted by the total number of transactions between
nodes. Additionally, we computed additional summary statistics such as the sum,
mean, minimum and maximum amount of Ethereum sent and received between
addresses. We also chose to evaluate the performance of four additional models:
Graph Convolution Networks, Node2Vec, GraphSAGE, and Topology Adaptive
Graph Convolution Networks. We believe this richer selection of models will
lead to better performance in our prediction task, relative to that of Graph
Attention Networks, due to the sparsity of our transaction graph’s structure. We
will evaluate each model by taking the mean testing accuracy in 10 model runs.
Our primary output will be a website. Our paper will be successful because
we already have access to a dataset with the exact information we need. The
dataset contains nodes of accounts and edges of transactions, which is what we
are looking for to run node classification.

Abstract
Recent social and economic trends have led to a rise in the number of people
cooking at home. However, many people struggle to find recipes that fit their current
culinary goals. We present a novel approach to help users find personalized recipes
using heterogeneous graphs. We use a graph data structure to represent recipes
and reviews, and leverage the graph structure to capture the relationships between
recipes and users. We then use a graph neural network to learn a representation
of the graph that can be used to recommend recipes to users. We evaluate our
approach on a dataset of food.com reviews and show that our model outperforms
a baseline model that does not leverage the graph structure.
1 Introduction
We’ve all been there. It’s been a long day of work, but you’re finally home and ready to cook. The
only problem: you have no idea what to make.
•You could fall back on some classics, but it feels like you’ve been eating the same thing for
weeks.
• You could go out to eat, but that’s expensive and you’re trying to save money.
• You could order takeout, but that’s unhealthy and you’re trying to eat better.
What’s needed is a way to find new recipes that you’ll actually enjoy, personalized to the things you
already have on hand. Users should be able to open up an app, see what’s been scheduled for the day,
and start cooking. Should users not like what’s scheduled, it should be easy to swap out recipes for
something else and incorporate that feedback into future meals.
To my knowledge, nothing like this is available on the market. Existing services generally fall within
one of two categories.
•Recipe Aggregators: These services provide a collection of recipes that users can browse
and search. Users are expected to find the recipes they want to cook themselves. Some
services such as Yummly have integrated personalized search recommendations to make
finding recipes easier, yet require users to manually build out their meal plans.
•Meal Kits: These services provide pre-portioned ingredients and recipes for users to cook.
Users select from pre-determined plans (such as Meat & Veggies) and are sent a box of
pre-portioned ingredients with their associated recipe each week. Minor customization is
possible, but users are locked into a limited number of recipes. These services can become
quite expensive and often require users to commit to a subscription.Each service has its own strengths and weaknesses. Recipe aggregators are free and allow users to
cook whatever they want, but require users to do all the work of finding recipes and building out
meal plans. Meal kits are convenient and allow users to cook without having to think about it, but are
expensive and require users to commit to a subscription.
This project is the first step to creating the system that combines the best of both worlds. We propose
a solution to the core piece powering it all: the recommendation system.
2 Methods
To build out our recipe recommendation system, we used an existing dataset published by Majumder
u. a. (2019) of food.com reviews. After cleaning the dataset and parsing it into a graph data structure,
we were left with the following nodes/edges:
Figure 1: Graph structure of the recipe dataset
This data was then uploaded to TigerGraph, a graph database that allows for fast and scalable storage
of graph databases. Their schema system was particularly useful for this project, as it allowed us to
easily define the heterogeneous structure of the graph directly inside the database.
We then downloaded the data into a Python environment and trained a variety of graph-based models.
2.1 K-Means Collaborative Filtering
Our first attempt at recommending recipes to users was to use a K-Means collaborative filtering
model. K-Means collaborative filtering is a classical algorithm that recommends items to users under
the assumption that users with similar tastes will like similar items.
The model works by first computing a similarity score between users. We chose to use the pearson
correlation coefficient as our similarity metric, due to its ability to handle non-centered ratings (such
as the 1-5 ratings we used). The model then predicts a score for each user-recipe interaction based on
a weighted average of the ratings of users.
Recipe Score (u, r) =µu+P
u′Similarity (u, u′)·(Rating (u′, r)−µu′)P
u′Similarity (u, u′)
Recommendations are then as simple as sorting the recipes by their predicted score and choosing the
topk.
We implemented the algorithm in two ways for this project.
1.surprise : An open-source Python library that implements a variety of recommendation
algorithms (Hug, 2020). Their implementation of Centered K-NN closely mirrors the
algorithm described above, thus making it an easy choice for our first model.
22.GSQL : We also implemented the model inside TigerGraph using GSQL. This allowed us to
run recommendations directly inside the database , allowing for lightning fast recommenda-
tions suitable for real-time applications.
One important distinction between our implementations and many others is that we did not filter
out recipes that users have already interacted with. We decided to do this because we wanted to be
able to recommend recipes that users have already interacted with, but may have not tried in awhile.
This is particularly important to note when considering the results of our prior user research, which
suggested that users generally prefer to cook recipes they’ve already cooked before.
2.2 Graph Neural Networks
While a pure collaborative filtering model is able to capture some of the relationships between users
and recipes, it’s unable to capture more complex relationships. For example, if a user has a history of
liking Indian food, we would like our system to recommend other Indian recipes (regardless of what
""similar users"" are having). To accomplish this, we next experimented with graph neural networks
(GNNs).
Two libraries were used to implement the GNNs created in this project:
•PyTorch : A popular deep learning framework (Paszke u. a., 2019). This library was chosen
because it is well documented and has a large community of users.
•PyTorch Geometric : A library that extends PyTorch to support graph neural networks
(Fey und Lenssen, 2019). This library was chosen for its natural integration with PyTorch.
2.2.1 LightGCN
After researching a variety of GNN architectures, we decided to expand on the LightGCN model
architecture. LightGCN is a GNN architecture created by He u. a. (2020) specifically designed for
recommendation tasks.
At its core, LightGCN is similar to traditional matrix factorization methods. It uses a user embedding
matrix Uand a recipe embedding matrix Rto represent the latent features of users and recipes. The
score for a particular user-recipe interaction is then computed as the dot product of the user and recipe
embeddings.
Recipe Score (u, r) =UT
uRr
This equation can be thought of as the sum of a user’s preferences for each feature multiplied by the
recipe’s affinity for that feature. For example, if a latent feature corresponded with ""spice"", users who
like spicy food would have a high value for that feature as would recipes that are spicy. Thus, the
resulting score for such a user-recipe interaction would be high.
The difference between LightGCN and traditional matrix factorization methods is that LightGCN
learns the embedding matrices in context of the graph. Before computing the score for a user-
recipe interaction, LightGCN first passes the user and recipe embeddings through a ""light graph
convolution"" layer. This layer uses the features of each node’s neighbor(s) in a normalized weighted
sum to compute the new embedding for that node.
Uu←X
r∈N(u)1√dudrRr
Rr←X
u∈N(r)1√drduUu
This process can then be repeated and averaged to allow for more complex modeling.
During training, we utilized Baysean Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss to optimize the each of the
embedding matrices. BPR loss is a loss function that is commonly used for recommendation tasks. It
is designed to maximize the score of positive/real user-recipe interactions and minimize the score of
3negative/fake user-recipe interactions. To help prevent overfitting, we also added a regularization
term to the loss function.
BPR Loss =−1
NX
(u,r,r′)∈Dlogσ(UT
uRr−UT
uRr′)
Regularization =λ· X
u∥Uu∥2+X
r∥Rr∥2!
2.2.2 RecGCN
While LightGCN is able to capture a lot of underlying relationships, it neglects a variety of information
we have available to us.
•Recipe Features : LightGCN only uses the user and recipe embeddings to compute the score
for a user-recipe interaction. However, we have a variety of features available to us for each
recipe, such as nutritional information and cooking time.
•Review Rating : LightGCN only normalizes the weights of each interaction by the degree of
each node. However, we have access to the actual rating that each user gave to each recipe,
which indicates how strong the interaction actually was.
To address these issues, we propose a new GNN architecture called RecGCN. RecGCN is a slight
modification of LightGCN with two main changes. First, we scale the graph convolution layer by the
review’s score.
Uu←X
r∈N(u)Review (u, r)√dudrRr
Rr←X
u∈N(r)Review (u, r)√drduUu
Second, we define a recipe feature matrix F. This matrix contains a row for each recipe, and a column
for each feature. We have two options for how to use this matrix.
•Opposite Embedding : We can substitute the recipe embedding matrix Rwith the recipe
feature matrix F. Due to the nature of the graph convolution layer, we also need to redefine
the user embedding matrix Uto have the same number of columns as F. This will force the
model to learn embeddings for the user for each recipe-defined feature.
•Combination : We can concatenate the recipe embedding matrix Rwith the recipe feature
matrix F. This will allow the model to learn embeddings for each recipe-defined feature,
as well as latent embeddings for the recipe as a whole. Due to the nature of the graph
convolution layer, we also need to redefine the user embedding matrix Uto have the same
number of columns as F+R.
3 Results
In this section, we compare the results of our various models. All experiments were performed on a
desktop workstation with a AMD Ryzen 9 5900X CPU and Nvidia RTX 3080 GPU.
All models were trained solely on interactions with is_train = True . For models that support
iterative training, we saved the best model based on its Precision@10 performance on interactions with
is_validation = True . Models were finally evaluated on interactions with is_test = True .
The results are shown in Figure 2 for recommendations at several kvalues.
The first thing to note is that K-NN collaborative filtering did not work well with this dataset,
performing far worse then every GNN model. Further research reveals that this may be due to the
fact that the dataset is extremely sparse, with only ≈52% of test users and ≈79% of test recipes
4Figure 2: Model results on the test set
even showing up in the training set. With both needed to even produce a recommendation, this results
in a very small number of possible interactions.
This finding also explains LightGCN’s great performance, which is comparable to the original
LightGCN paper’s results on the Amazon-Book dataset (another sparse dataset).
Surprisingly, LightGCN performed well enough to outperform every version of RecGCN. We believe
this may be similar to the reason LightGCN outperformed many of its predecessors: the simplicity of
the architecture. One common issue we ran into during training is that our models quickly began
to overfit the data, resulting in poor performance on the validation set. Simpler models are able to
sidestep this issue through their inability to model complex relationships.
In order to further investigate how each RecGCN alteration affected the model, we also performed an
analysis on each of the changes we made. The results are shown in Figure 3.
The first thing to note is that the addition of review weights destroyed the model’s performance. We
believe this may be due to multiple high reviews exponentially scaling certain embeddings, resulting
in a complex relationship that the model is unable to model. We talk more about possible solutions to
this issue in the future work section.
The second thing to note is that the addition of recipe features did not have a significant impact on
the model’s performance. If anything, it slightly decreased the model’s performance. We believe
this may be due to the fact that the features we have available to us aren’t as descriptive as the latent
variables learned by the model. For example, LightGCN may learn that a user prefer’s ""healthier""
recipes, but a opposite embedding RecGCN model can only learn whether a user likes recipes low in
fat.
4 Conclusion & Future Work
At the end of the day, the success of this project is based on whether or not it can be used to solve the
problem of meal planning. To that end, we believe that our models are able to provide a good starting
point for a full meal planning system. The recommendation engines we built are able to recommend
recipes that a user is likely to enjoy, particularly if the rest of the system is built with the weaknesses
we found in mind. We envision a system that allows users to reject recipes for their weekly meal plan,
and then have the system automatically recommend new recipes to replace them. Our best model is
5Figure 3: RecGCN changes on the test set
able to recommend a recipe the user enjoys within roughly 50 iterations even with a relatively small
history .
The best part of such a system is that those rejections can be used to improve the recommendation
engine. The system can learn from the user’s rejections and use that information to improve the
recommendations in the future. This not only results in better recipes for the user, but solves the
sparsity problem that we ran into with all of our models!
Figure 4: Current UX Mockup
We plan to continue this work in a commercial setting. We believe that this project can be a core
component of a full system that helps people save time and money by automating the process of meal
planning and grocery shopping.
6Future work includes:
•User Interface : Performing a user study to determine the best way to present the rec-
ommendations to the user. One early prototype of the user interface is shown in Figure
4.
•Software Development : Developing the core app to be used by the user.
•Alternative Recommendation Methods : Investigate other recommendation methods, such
as Facebook’s Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM) (Naumov u. a., 2019).
As for the research side of this project, we plan to continue investigating the following:
•RecGCN Review Weighting : Investigate alternative methods of weighting the reviews,
such scaling the weights by the user’s average or normalizing the new edge weight by the
sum of the reviews.
•Recipe Features : Investigate alternative methods of using recipe features, such as using a
neural network to learn the best way to combine the features with the embeddings.

Counting Organized Substructures

Abstract
Network graphs have emerged to be a relevant tool in organizing and investigating the relationship among in-
dividual agents in systems within numerous domains of study. Yet in certain contexts, clustering a network
to identify unique sub-populations can uncover hidden insights of the data to encourage further analy-
sis. Although clustering isn’t a relatively novel concept in network science, partitioning around recurring
substructures, or motifs, that cumulatively construct these dense graphs remains unexplored. In order to
perform such clustering, our main endeavor is to develop an efficient pipeline for counting the number of
occurrences of specific substructures in any densely concentrated network graph. Primarily we will be exam-
ining the frequency of triangular motifs, all of which contain three separate nodes, but vary in the number
and direction of edges. While required for spectral clustering, motif counting imposes a bottleneck as the
most time-consuming step which we aim to accelerate by introducing sampling algorithms to reduce a dense
network to a sparser, but still representative subset.
Introduction
Networks have become a widely popularized method for representing interconnected systems of data across
various academic disciplines - mapping the transmitted activations between neurons in the brain, tracking
the behavior of social media users, and countless more. While an individual node is commonly considered
to be the elementary building block of a typical network graph, many density-rich networks demonstrate
connectivity patterns when considering higher-order motifs as the fundamental unit of analysis. Examining
the properties of a network can often require its partition into separate sub-graphs which represent individual
populations. Methods to cluster network graphs on the lower level of individual nodes have already been
thoroughly discussed, but few have investigated clustering a network upon the higher level of motifs, which
we wish to further explore in this study. A preliminary step we must take however, is to efficiently measure
the frequency that a given motif appears in our network of inquiry. By counting each unique occurrence of a
motif and recording the specific nodes that instance is composed of, we are now enabled to utilize a scalable,
yet efficient algorithm to perform higher-order clustering.
Much of our endeavors are based upon the substantial work done by Austin R. Benson, David F. Gleich,
and Jure Leskovec in their work, Higher-order organization of complex networks . The authors most notably
establish the central framework by which to partition clusters that are maximally ‘separated.’ According to
Benson, Glech, and Leskovec, sub-graphs should be separated on the basis of minimizing motif conductance,
quantified by the number of motifs with nodes spanning more than one cluster. Motif conductance results
in what the authors refer to as cuts, where edges of a motif ‘cut’ or intersect multiple clusters. Deriving the
authors’ algorithm to perform approximately optimal clustering according to this framework first requires
an adjacency matrix of motif frequencies, and thus comes our primary objective of efficiently counting their
recurring instances.
1As discussed earlier, with networks remaining to be a prevalent metric to analyze complex systems for many
scientific disciplines, the methodologies for motif counting and clustering will be applicable to virtually any
domain. However, in demonstrating our algorithmic procedures, we will be referencing our work done with
a wide range of graph datasets ranging in topics from airline travel, cryptocurrency, internet weblinks, and
email communications. Many if not all, of these datasets are originally sourced as a raw text file that
were pre-processed into an unweighted, directed network graph for analysis. Prior to performing clustering,
exploratory data analysis will also be executed to calculate elementary statistics such as the number of
independent nodes and connecting edges, as well as the distribution of node degrees. Regarding the motifs
themselves, our investigation will count the frequency of 13 unique triangular substructures, all of which are
composed of three distinct nodes with variations in the number and direction of connecting edges.
Pseudocode outlining the steps to implement our algorithm to count all instances of motif 1 for example are
outlined below:
Motif Counting Algorithm
For reference, shown below are the 13 triangular motifs for which we are counting and classifying upon
alongside pseudocode of our native counting algorithm for specifically motif 1:
Input:Directed, unweighted graph G and motif M
Output: Set of all uniquely counted instances of motif M in G
adj_list_away :dictionary containing all the nodes for which the given node in G has an edge going towards
adj_list_in:dictionary containing all the nodes which have an edge pointing towards the given node in G
motif_occurrences :array to store all counted instances of motif 1 in G
Iterate for each unique vertex v1inadj_list_away :
|Iterate for each unique vertex v2whichv1points to (obtained via adj_list_away):
|Iterate for each unique vertex v3whichv2points to (obtained via adj_list_away):
| If (v3points tov1) and (v1does not point towards v3) and
| (v2does not point towards v3) and (v2does not point towards v1):
| Store{v1,v2,v3}as an instance of motif 1 in G.
Remove all duplicate permutations of any counted motif in motif_occurrences .
2As can be seen above, the motif counting algorithm sequentially iterates through each possible combination
of connected node triplets that exist in the network graph Gusing two adjacency lists, adj_list_away
andadj_list_in, which are both used to keep track of directed edges between nodes. In fact, all of our
counting algorithms for the 13 unique motifs follow this similar structure of iterating through three connected
vertices to detect an possible occurrence of a given motif. Thus, the computational time complexity for all
of our counting algorithms is O(n3), wherenis the number of nodes in G. Where each of the 13 counting
algorithms differ for their specific motif is in the terminating step, where it checks to see if the edges among
the three connected vertices follow the same directional patterns as outlined by the given motif.
For demonstration, one of the datasets for which the counting algorithms of each motifs were applied to was
a network comprising the reachability of airline travel among cities in the United States and Canada. As
shown in the visualization below, the structure of certain motifs can attribute towards a greater prevalence in
specific contextual domains than others. More specifically, we see that for triangular motifs, M1throughM7
all have a similar number of occurrences due to the overall density of this particular network and similarity
of structure, only seemingly differing in edge direction. However, a significant outlier can be witnessed for
wedges (motifs M8toM13), for which M13appears much more prominently than the rest.
Often times, first counting all the substructures in any network can provide useful insight when deciding
the choice of motif to cluster upon, as we would intuitively start our analysis initially with the motif most
prominent in frequency. With this in mind, subsequent sections will thoroughly delve into the process of
clustering based on motif occurrences.
3Spectral Motif Clustering
One of the primary motivations behind our exploration into higher-order spectral clustering is the recon-
sideration of motifs (in our particular case, triangular substructures) to be the primary building blocks of
complex networks, rather than individual nodes themselves. Analyzing network-structured data through
a motif-centric representation can be especially useful in understanding modular connectivity patterns in
many contextual domains of study - some of which include peer networks on social media, neuron connec-
tions in the brain, and even flight patterns between adjacent cities. Since clustering networks on the basis of
motif composition as opposed to individual nodes is a relatively novel endeavor, we hope to promote further
exploration by discussing possible algorithms to handle this task.
When identifying possible sub-communities within a complex network, we want reoccurring motifs to stay
centrally located only within a single class, as opposed to spanning across multiple clusters. This follows
natural intuition that these communities are well separated, such that motifs do not intersect across multiple
clusters yet remain densely self-contained. Building upon this framework, an optimal cluster Sis thus a set
of nodes which minimizes the motif conductance, defined to be
ϕ(S) =cutM(S,S)/min (volM(S),volM(S))
wherecutM(S,S)is the number of motifs whose nodes lie in more than one unique cluster (i.e, the number
of motifs whose edges cross the boundary delineating separate clusters apart) and volM(S)is the number
of nodes counted in all occurrences of a given motif Mthat are located in cluster S(this can be simply
counted by the number of motif end points in S).
Ideally, given a network and a motif to construct its corresponding graph by, we’d want to find the cluster
that maximizes separability by minimizing the motif conductance. However, empirically determining the
exact cluster which absolutely minimizes this metric is a computationally infeasible problem (NP-Hard). To
workaround this obstacle, Austin R. Benson, David F. Gleich, and Jure Leskovec in their paper, Higher-order
organization of complex networks presenttwoalgorithmswhichutilizespectralclusteringtofindnear-optimal
sub-communities.
The following is a diagram outlining our overall motif counting and clustering pipeline. First starting with
the network graph to be analyzed, all unique instances of the desired motif are counted, for which each
and every participating edge is used to form the motif adjacency matrix shown. This matrix is then passed
an input into either of two viable spectral clustering algorithms that output the near-optimal clusters with
minimal motif conductance.
Both of these spectral clustering algorithms are explored in much further detail in the following sections.
4Algorithm 1: Motif-based clustering algorithm for finding a single cluster
Pseudocode outlining the steps to implement algorithm 1 are outlined below:
Input:Directed, unweighted graph G and motif M
Output: Motif-based cluster (subset of nodes in G)
(WM)ij:number of instances of M that contain nodes i and j
GM:weighted graph induced WM
DM:diagonal matrix with (DM)ii=/summationtext
j(WM)ij
z:eigenvector of the second smallest eigenvalue for LM=I−D−1/2
MWMD−1/2
M
σi:to be index of D−1/2
Mzwith theith smallest value
Sweep over all prefixes of σ:
S:argmin lϕ(GM)(Sl),whereSl={σ1,...,σ l}
ifS <|S|:
|returnS
else:
|returnS
To begin the derivation for the first clustering algorithm, which calculates a single cluster S(and thereby
its complement S), we begin with a directed, unweighted graph G, and a motif Mas inputs. From G, we
formWM, the motif adjacency matrix, such that each value in coordinates (i,j)corresponds to the number
of times the edge between node iand nodejparticipates in all instances of motif M. In fact, by using the
motif counting algorithms discussed earlier, we can obtain the counts for every edge between every possible
combination of nodes iandjwherei̸=j. These counts will be used to form WMonce the designated motif
counting algorithm is conducted on G.
WMwill then be used to form a diagonal matrix (DM)ii=/summationtext
j(WM)ij, where each diagonal entry is the
cumulative sum of all values in every row of WM. Afterwards we perform Laplacian Matrix Normalization,
obtaining the matrix LM=I−D−1/2
MWMD−1/2
M. The Fielder vector, f(M)=D−1/2
Mzis calculated where z
is the eigenvector corresponding to the second smallest eigenvalue of L.
In the final step, we must sort the entries of f(M)in ascending order to create a set Sl={σ1,...,σ l}, where
σirepresents the index of the ith smallest element in f(M). Finally, the algorithm recursively calculates the
motif conductance of the set Sr={σ1,...,σ r}wherer= 1,...,l. To demonstrate, this would first involve
calculating the motif conductance of {σ1}, then{σ1,σ2}, up to{σ1,...,σ l}. This algorithm completes by
returning the set with the smallest calculated motif conductance as the near-optimal cluster S.
Cheeger Inequality
An important fact regarding the first algorithm is that Benson, Gleich, and Leskovec specifically reference
theCheeger Inequality to demonstratively prove that it will return a near-optimal cluster, since finding
the most optimal cluster is computationally intractable.
TheCheeger Inequality is as follows:
ϕM(S)≤4/radicalbig
ϕ∗
M
whereϕM(S)is the motif conductance of the set returned by algorithm 1 and ϕ∗
Mis similarly the motif
conductance of the theoretically most optimal cluster. Specifically, this inequality states that the motif
conductance of the algorithm’s returned cluster Sis only within a quadratic factor of the most optimal motif
conductance theoretically possible.
5Algorithm 2: Motif-based clustering algorithm for finding several clusters
Pseudocode outlining the steps to implement algorithm 2 are outlined below:
Input:Directed, unweighted graph G, motif M, number of clusters k
Output:kdisjoint motif-based clusters
(WM)ij:number of instances of M that contain nodes i and j
DM:diagonal matrix with (DM)ii=/summationtext

MWMD−1/2
M
Yij:zij//radicalig/summationtextk
j=1z2
ij
Embed node iintoRkby taking the ith row of the matrix Y
Runk-means clustering on the embedded nodes
Before we delve into the implementation for algorithm 2, it’s important to note several key differences
between it and the first algorithm. Most notably, while algorithm 1 allows the user to only find a single
cluster, the second algorithm can be used to determine multiple clusters at once. However, a tradeoff is that
it’s not as theoretically robust as algorithm 1, lacking the same guarantee on optimal motif conductance
granted by the Cheeger inequality.
From visual inspection alone, it can be seen that both algorithms share many of the same inputs (with the
exception of algorithm 2 requiring an additional input kfor the number of desired clusters to be determined)
and introductory steps, up to performing Laplacian Matrix Normalization to get LM=I−D−1/2
MWMD−1/2
M.
From there, algorithm 2 deviates by calculating the eigenvectors {z1,...,z k}of theksmallest eigenvalues of
LM.
With the set of eigenvectors {z1,...,z k}, we can form a matrix Zusing them as column vectors, such that
Z= [z1... zk]. Then to create the matrix Y, divide each value in every row of Zby the square root of the
square sum of that row’s entries. This is equivalent to Yij:zij//radicalig/summationtextk
j=1z2
ij. Here,Yis ann×kmatrix,
where each row represents the coordinates of one of the nnodes in k-dimensional space. For example, if the
first row of Yis the row vector [1 2 3], then node 1is represented by a point located at (1,2,3)inR3.
After embedding each of the nnodes onto points in Rk, the k-means clustering algorithm is run on these
points to classify each node to one of the kclusters.
Sampling Graph Networks
Torecap, ourpipelineforthetransformingarawdatasetofanetworkgraphintoanorganizedandpartitioned
dataset is as follows:
1.Clean and pre-process the raw data, which comes in a text file format.
2.Count the number of occurrences of each motif in the network, identifying motifs which are
|especially prevelant.
3.Utilize the edges of every observed motif to form the motif adjacency matrix.
4.Pass in the motif adjacency matrix as inputs into the spectral clustering algorithms.
However, when executing these steps on datasets of considerable magnitude, practical concerns regarding
efficient runtime and space demands can arise which impart an obstacle in a successful completion. In
particular, the second step of motif counting becomes a major bottleneck for computational execution time.
Thus, one possible workaround is to explore various network sampling methods such that we will only have
to perform motif counting on only a smaller subset of the original network which ideally minimizes the total
runtime while still preserving as much contextual information as possible to obtain near-optimal clusters.
6Our proposed sampling technique we’ve recently investigated is outlined below:
1.Establish a sampling threshold kfor the number of edges sampled.
2.Depending on the motif of interest, designate a ""central"" node p.
3.Like the naive algorithm, repeatedly iterate through each edge in the adjacency lists until vertex p
|is reached.
4.Count the number of edges nextending from vertex pwhich satisfy the fulfilled motif as its degree.
5.Ifn≤k,count all of those edges towards instances of the desired motif to cluster on.
6.Otherwise, randomly sample kof those edges towards instances of the target motif.
7.When forming the motif adjacency matrix for the spectral clustering algorithms, the counts of any
|sampled motif edges are upscaled by a factor proportional to the degree of p.
Note that the above algorithm mentions that the choice of the node for plargely depends on the structure
of the triangular motif in regards to the number and direction of its edges. Take for example, motifs M7and
M8, shown below for convenience of reference:
BecauseM7has a symmetrical structure, having bidirectional edges between all three vertices, the choice of
nodepfor which to sample on if required, doesn’t necessarily matter on the result of the output counts (or
the subsequent cluster for that matter). On the other hand, being a wedge, M8is only symmetric around
its top-most node in the middle, so when counting M8specifically, that node in particular is selected to be
p. Certain motifs may lack any form of symmetricity at all, so when choosing a “central” node, we opt for
the vertex that has the most connections (of similar direction if possible) either extending from or pointing
towards it.
The sampling algorithm additionally contains a parameter kwhich designates the number of nodes that can
be counted for the desired motif to cluster the network upon from what we call the “central” node pof that
motif. The smaller the value of k, the sparser the subset of the original network will be counted for motif
occurrences, inducing a greater speed up of execution time by reducing complexity further away from O(n3)
by essentially omitting one of the iterations of the naive counting algorithm. Naturally as kincreases, a
larger number of edges are accounted for, making the subset of the network approach the original but results
a greater execution time of the clustering pipeline as the bottleneck.
But not only do we want to decrease execution time, we aim to still preserve accuracy. We consider the
accuracy yielded by our sampling algorithm at a threshold kto intuitively be a measure of how close the
cluster obtained from a sampled network is from that obtained by the entire original graph which we consider
our baseline. Naturally a larger value for kincreases accuracy at the cost of minimizing execution time, and
vise-versa for a lower threshold.
Calculating the accuracy is inversely related to the dissimilarity of outputted clusters when sampling, found
by first taking the absolute value of the element-wise difference between the adjacency matrices of motif
counts from the non-sampled and sampled graphs. Afterwards, the sum of these absolute differences is di-
vided by the sum of edge counts in the adjacency matrix from the original, non-sampled network to obtain
a normalized proportion. Although this metric doesn’t involve utilizing the clusters themselves directly,
quantitatively measuring the dissimilarity between the inputs of the clustering algorithms provides an ap-
proximationoftherelativeclosenessbetweentheclusterstheyoutput. Reducingthetotaldifferenceindicates
that the sampling method resulted in a cluster similar to the baseline, thus having a higher accuracy. Our
current objective is to find the Pareto-optimal parameter which ideally balances our objectives of maximizing
cluster accuracy while minimizing the duration of execution.
7In the above figure, the sampling threshold is set to a value of 5, denoting that at most 5edges can be
considered from any node towards the occurrence of a target motif at any time. Assume that in this subset
network, the central green node is chosen to be vertex pin regards to the sampling algorithm, and that
all6of its edges are used in distinct occurrences for the motif of interest. Having a larger degree than the
threshold, only 5of the 6edges are randomly sampled to count towards unique motif appearances while the
remaining edge is disregarded. However, the edge counts for the motifs still observed despite the sampling
are then upscaled by a factor proportional to the degree of node pto account for a lower skew due to the
sparsity of the subset. On the other hand, if we take the red node to be vertex p, all of its four edges
(assumed to be part of individual motif occurrences) will be accounted for with the threshold of 5.
Results
To gauge the effectiveness of our proposed sampling algorithm with respect to the execution time and
preserved accuracy of our motif counting and clustering pipeline, the accuracy of numerous clusters were
measured from various datasets for multiple parameter combinations between the choice of motif and the
value of threshold k. To examine the effects of raising the sampling threshold, we first started with the
network of city reachability via airline travel introduced earlier, and calculated the accuracy of clusters
computed after sampling at increasing intervals for k. The results of this analysis are shown in the following
table, accompanied by the visualization on the following page:
Threshold Accuracy Speedup
2 0.52 16.893891
5 0.63 8.192926
10 0.88 4.614148
15 0.92 3.096463
20 0.98 2.286174
25 0.99 1.967846
8Spectral clustering was performed upon occurrences of motif M1after sampling the graph at various values
for the threshold k, which range from the interval [2,25]. It can be seen that the largest threshold of
25obtained a near perfect accuracy of approximately 99%, almost matching the input adjacency matrix
obtained from the original graph, while executing twice as fast. Reducing the threshold size does visibly
improve execution speed by a inversely proportional multiplicative factor, but at the cost of accuracy as
expected from earlier discussion.
Rather than constraining our analysis to just one graph however, we also investigated how the density and
structure of multiple networks from various domains affected the obtainable speedup possible via sampling
while still hitting a benchmark accuracy. This was investigated using again the city reachability network,
alongside three other graphs about Bitcoin transactions, messages between email users, and links between
various pages on Wikipedia. For each network, we’ve measured the speedup of the counting and clustering
pipeline for a motif prominent to each at a sampling threshold which met an accuracy of approximately 80%.
The results of this analysis are displayed in the following table and visualization below:
Dataset Speedup
City 6.0
Wiki 2.2
Email 1.8
Bitcoin 3.5
9The city reachability dataset allows for a remarkable 6×speedup while still obtaining 80%whereas the
Wikipedia and Bitcoin graphs each manage around 2×to3×increase in execution speed respectively. The
lowest speedup obtainable was for the email network, only performing counting and clustering 1.8×times as
fast, which while not necessarily an impressive magnitude at first glance, can still provide valuable practical
usefulness in preserving computational resources of time and space-wise.
Discussion
Our objective to explore and optimize motif spectral clustering began with first naively counting the unique
instances of a target motif in the input graph, later used to form the motif adjacency matrix. Such matrices
are relied upon as the inputs for the clustering algorithms introduced by Austin R. Benson, David F. Gleich,
and Jure Leskovec in Higher-order organization of complex networks . However, because motif counting is a
costly procedure for especially more dense networks, sampling methods derived from modifying the counting
algorithm provide a substantial improvement in the pipeline’s completion time while achieving clusters with
considerable accuracy. From the results of our investigation, it’s evident that a lower threshold marginally
reduces the computation time at the cost of accuracy, where as a larger threshold prioritizes accuracy at
a lower speedup. Although it’s best to find a Pareto-optimal sampling threshold that compromises both
accuracy and speedup, the value of such a parameter inevitable varies with each network, dependent on
factors such as structure and density.
Given ample time to further expand this study, we’d be eager to work with motifs of a variety of shapes,
beyond that of triangular structure, alongside datasets of a much greater magnitude in size. We additionally
encourage further experimentation with alternative counting methods beyond the O(n3)naive approach that
when coupled with sampling, could perhaps accelerate already existing speedups in execution. Lastly, this
10endeavor could be extended to empirically determine the relationship between network structure and the
optimal motif for clustering, both from a context-specific and a graph theory lens. Ultimately, the topic of
motif counting and clustering of networks still remains to be a relatively new domain left with much to be
researched. But nevertheless, we hope that by achieving efficient motif spectral clustering, new avenues will
open for meaningful and insightful analysis of networks and scientific discovery for any academic domain of
study.

ABSTRACT
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained tremendous
popularity for their potential to effectively learn from graph-
structured data, commonly encountered in real-world applica-
tions. However, most of these models, based on the message-
passing paradigm (interaction within a neighborhood of a
few nodes), can only handle local interactions within a graph.
When we enforce the models to use information from far away
nodes, we will encounter two major issues — oversmoothing
[7] & oversquashing [12]. Architectures such as the trans-
former and diffusion models are introduced to solve this. Yet,
these models are not tested on large graph datasets contain-
ing graphs with large diameters. Although transformers are
powerful, they require significant computational resources for
both training and inference, thereby limiting their scalability,
particularly for graphs with long-term dependencies. Hence,
this paper proposes GraphHSCN—a Heterogenized Spectral
Cluster Network, a message-passing-based approach specifi-
cally designed for capturing long-range interaction informa-
tion (when prediction depends on representations of distant
nodes interacting with each other)[2].
INTRODUCTION
General discussion of graph data
All varieties of real-world data can be represented as graphs,
and the complicated interactions between the node instances in
the graph data are usually very valuable information to learn.
The recent developments of Graph Neural Networks showed
significant success in learning graph data. However, some-
times in the graph data, the interactions between two node
instances might be too complicated to learn. One situation is
ACM ISBN 978-1-4503-2138-9.
DOI: 10.1145/1235when the two nodes are very far from each other but interact-
ing. Our project tries to help the GNNs learn this long-range
interaction.
Common GNN architectures
Three models are first learned during this quarter. These mod-
els are Graph Convolutional Network [4], Graph Attention
Network [13], and Graph Isomorphism Network [15]. The
idea of GCNs is to learn a function of features on a graph
with a feature matrix as X and a representation of the graph
structure in matrix form, which typically is adjacency matrix
A. Combine these together, and we will have node-level output
as a matrix. We can also, from there, have graph-level output
through global pooling. In this case, each layer in the GCN is
a function that propagates information forward with a weight
matrix. Compared to GCN, Graph Attention Network [4], or
GAT, used the attention mechanism. One key difference is
that, by using the attention mechanism, the more important
node during the aggregation will have a higher weight. And in-
stead of multiple channels used in GCN, GAT used multi-head
attention. As shown in the graph below: [13] Graph Isomor-
phism Network [15], or GIN, used the idea of isomorphism
to build a GNN that generalizes the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph
isomorphism test. In the paper, the authors introduced a theory
of “deep multisets.” They showed that with universal multiset
functions, aggregation schemes over nodes and the multiset of
their neighbors could be built. And this function can be learned
through MLPs. Another type of GNN depends on the idea
of transformers. Introduced by the paper “Rethinking Graph
Transformers with Spectral Attention” [5], Spectral Attention
Network or SAN used the Transformers and its self-attention
mechanism to try to encode the graph structure. SAN attempts
to solve the issue of message-passing GNNs that can’t learn
the long-range interactions in graphs.
Major Challenges
As mentioned in the abstract, two major challenges exist to
prevent models under the ""message passing"" paradigm from
performing well on long-range graph datasets: oversmoothing
[7] & oversquashing [12].Oversmoothing
In the context of long-range interaction graph datasets, over-
smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) refers to a
situation where the model loses information about the orig-
inal graph structure and flattens the node embeddings to be
indistinguishable from each other because the information got
diluted when transmitting across a long chain of nodes. This
can result in decreased accuracy and poor performance on
downstream tasks.
In other words, GNNs operate by aggregating and updating
the representations of neighboring nodes iteratively. However,
if the number of iterations is too high or the aggregation opera-
tion is too strong, the embeddings of all nodes become similar,
making it difficult for the model to distinguish between them.
Oversquashing
The phenomena of ""oversquashing"" occurs in Message Passing
Neural Networks (MPNNs) when the learned task requires
long-range dependencies and the structure of the graph results
in exponentially many long-range neighboring nodes. In such
situations, messages coming from non-adjacent nodes need to
be propagated and compressed into fixed-size vectors, causing
a phenomenon of information oversquashing. The structural
characteristics of the graph responsible for oversquashing are
referred to as ""bottlenecks"".
These phenomenons are extensively observed empirically, but
the theoretical understanding of them is rather limited.
Relevant works for our architecture
In order to deal with the above-mentioned problem, we studied
existing literature in this domain. Below, we will quickly go
over their main ideas.
Positional Encoding
To begin with, SignNet [6] is designed to be invariant to sign
flips of eigenvectors, which is an important property for spec-
tral graph representation learning because eigenvectors can
have both positive and negative values.
SignNet is built using a feedforward neural network with a
series of linear and non-linear transformations. The input
to the network is the Laplacian eigenvectors of a graph, and
the output is a vector representing a graph embedding. The
network is trained to minimize a loss function that measures
the similarity between the predicted embeddings and the true
embeddings of the graph.
SignNet is shown to be universal under certain conditions,
meaning that it can approximate any continuous function of
eigenvectors with the desired invariances. The authors also
demonstrate that SignNet outperforms existing spectral graph
representation methods on several benchmark datasets.
Global shortcuts
Then, the paper ""FoSR"" [3] proposes a computationally effi-
cient algorithm for graph neural networks (GNNs) that pre-
vents two common problems in GNNs: oversquashing and
oversmoothing.
As mentioned in the ""Major Challenges"" sections, oversquash-
ing is a problem that arises when GNNs pass messages alongthe edges of the graph, leading to inefficient information prop-
agation for certain graph topologies. This problem is linked to
the curvature and spectral gap of the graph. Oversmoothing,
on the other hand, occurs when adding edges to the message-
passing graph can lead to increasingly similar node represen-
tations.
The proposed algorithm uses spectral expansion to systemati-
cally add edges to the graph and prevent oversquashing, while
a relational architecture is used to preserve the original graph
structure and prevent oversmoothing. The authors demonstrate
experimentally that their algorithm outperforms existing graph
rewiring methods in several graph classification tasks.
In summary, ""FoSR"" proposes an algorithm for GNNs that ad-
dresses two common problems in GNNs - oversquashing and
oversmoothing - by using spectral expansion and a relational
architecture.
Spectral clustering
In order to solve the issue of transformers being too expan-
sive to compute, especially for larger graphs, we explored
the method from ""Spectral Clustering with Graph Neural Net-
works for Graph Pooling"" [1] to decrease the workload for the
attention-based procedures.
This paper proposes a new graph clustering method that can
be used to implement pooling operations in Graph Neural Net-
works (GNNs). Though Spectral clustering (SC) is a popular
technique to find strongly connected communities on a graph,
but it can be expensive to compute the eigendecomposition of
the Laplacian, and clustering results are graph-specific, mean-
ing that pooling methods based on SC must perform a new
optimization for each new sample.
To address these limitations, the paper proposes a continuous
relaxation of the normalized minCUT problem and trains a
GNN to compute cluster assignments that minimize this objec-
tive. The proposed method is differentiable, does not require
computing the spectral decomposition, and learns a cluster-
ing function that can be quickly evaluated on out-of-sample
graphs.
The authors use this clustering method to design a graph pool-
ing operator that overcomes some important limitations of
state-of-the-art graph pooling techniques and achieves the best
performance in several supervised and unsupervised tasks.
In summary, the paper proposes a new differentiable graph
clustering method that can be used in GNNs to implement
pooling operations without requiring the expensive computa-
tion of spectral decomposition. The proposed pooling operator
achieves state-of-the-art performance in several tasks.
Heterogeneous graph
Later, we found the Heterogeneous graph architecture [11]
to help our model learn from both the original graph and the
virtual nodes and edged created from our clustering results.
The Heterogeneous graph paper describes an approach for
analyzing and mining knowledge from interconnected, multi-
typed data, including relational databases, that form complex
and semi-structured information networks.The authors argue that most network science researchers focus
on homogeneous networks without distinguishing different
types of objects and links, which is not suitable for complex,
multi-typed data in the real world.
The paper proposes a structural analysis approach for mining
useful knowledge from such networks by leveraging the rich
semantic meaning of structural types of objects and links in
the networks. The authors summarize a set of methodologies
that can effectively and efficiently mine knowledge from such
information networks and point out some promising research
directions.
In summary, the paper presents a framework for analyzing
and mining knowledge from complex, heterogeneous infor-
mation networks, which are common in the real world but
often neglected in network science research. The proposed
approach leverages the rich semantic meaning of structural
types of objects and links in the networks and provides a set
of methodologies for effectively and efficiently mining useful
knowledge from such networks.
Attention
After the extraction of cluster-level features, we also want to
explore if we can use the attention mechanism to find addi-
tional connections between clusters. Here, for larger clusters,
we used sparse attention [17] to make the computation more
efficient. However, some graph datasets have rather small clus-
ters after the second procedure so we also explored whether
global attention mechanisms such as set2set [14] could further
improve the performance. We will give more details about
what sparse attention and set2set are in the following two
paragraphs.
Here, sparse attention refers to Sparse Graph Attention Net-
works (SGATs)[17], which are a type of Graph Neural Net-
work (GNN) that improve the performance of graph learning
tasks by learning to assign sparse attention coefficients over
a graph’s neighbors. This sparsity is achieved through an L0
-norm regularization, which allows SGATs to identify noisy or
task-irrelevant edges and perform feature aggregation on the
most informative neighbors. SGATs have been shown to out-
perform traditional GNNs, such as Graph Attention Networks
(GATs), on both assortative and disassortative graphs, while
removing about 50-80% of edges from large assortative graphs
without sacrificing classification accuracy. SGATs are the first
graph learning algorithm to demonstrate significant redundan-
cies in graphs, and their edge-sparsified graphs can achieve
similar or sometimes even higher predictive performance than
original graphs.
Set2Set [14] is a neural network architecture that aggregates
information from node-level features in a graph to make
graph-level predictions. It does this by adding a permutation-
invariant operation that can aggregate information from all
node features into a fixed-length vector, which is used to make
the final prediction. It works by iteratively refining a set-level
representation of the input graph, which is initialized with the
node-level features.
Following the general flow of GraphGPS (General Powerful
Scalable Graph Transformers) [8], we concatenate the outputfrom the sparse attention output on the cluster level with the
GCN output feature on the node level. These concatenated
results are passed through a Multi-layer Perceptron to create a
final prediction.
Dataset
Our benchmark datasets, described below, span both levels of
graph learning. We compare our architecture’s performance
to those of these common message-passing graph neural net-
works: GCN, GAT, and GIN. Additionally, we compare it
with SAN, [5], a transformer architecture, the first of which
to consider the full spectrum of eigenvalues for positional
encoding.
Node Classification: Resampled Citation Datasets
Our first benchmark considers the transductive semi-
supervised node classification task on citation networks. The
Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed networks [16] node features are
bag-of-words representations of documents and edges repre-
sent citation links. The goal of this task is to assign a class
to each document. To build the labeled training dataset, 20
instances of each class are randomly sampled. 1,000 instances
are sampled for the test dataset, and the remaining 500 for the
validation set. Our benchmarking method repeats training on
three different seeds of splitting on the datasets. The citation
networks are summarized in Table 1.
With the aim of tailoring these datasets to the task of long-
range model benchmarking, we adopt the resampling scheme
introduced in the Hierarchical Graph Network paper [9]. This
scheme retains the process of selecting 20 examples from each
class for training, but rather than doing so uniformly at random,
for a drawn node, it ""sanitizes"" its k-hop neighborhood of
labels. Due to the nature of a citation network, these datasets
have high homophily, meaning that most of a node’s first-
order neighbors belong to the same class. Because of this,
it is necessary to ensure the model carries a large enough
receptive field to reach beyond this neighborhood, so that
correct labels of the k-th order neighbors aren’t ""imprinted""
in their representations. In this study, we employ a buffer of
k=1and later hope to evaluate with k=2. These are the
same values as in the HGNet paper.
Graph-Level Prediction: Peptides Functional and Structural
Dataset
Peptides are short chains of amino acids, which are abundant
in nature and serve various important biological functions.
Despite being shorter than proteins, peptides have a molec-
ular structure that is significantly larger than that of a small
drug-like molecule, since each amino acid contains multiple
heavy atoms. The peptides were sourced from the SATPdb
database [10], which provides comprehensive information on
the sequence, 3D structure, function, and molecular graph of
each peptide. The graphs represent one-dimensional chains of
amino acids, emphasizing the need for the model to accurately
identify the location of each amino acid within the graph.
Peptides functional is for Graph Classification task and Pep-
tides Structural for Graph Regression task. The graphs in bothTable 1. Citation network dataset statistics.

datasets are correspond to peptides chain structures and are de-
rived in such way that the graphs have large diameters relative
to their sizes. Both datasets have 15535 graphs. [2]
We chose these two datasets in order to evaluate the GNNs’
abilities to learn long-range interactions for Graph-level tasks.
METHOD
In the architecture section, we detailed each component within
our model and in the dataset & benchmark section, we listed
the datasets we used and the SOTA models we compared our
model against.
Architecture
SignNet
In the architecture we determined to use SignNet to compute
the positional encoding for each graph. We pre-computed
the top 50 eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of the
laplacian matrix L of each graph. Then we used the com-
puted top 50 eigenvectors (Nx50) as the input for the SignNet.
The SignNet will be a function f:Rn×k→Rn×dwhere d is
arbitrary dimentions.
Spectral clustering
We trained a GNN model using pytorch-geometric and used
the loss functions as the sum of minCUT Loss and orthogonal
Loss to compute the cluster assignment for each graphs. We
trained for each graph for about 50 iterations with a early stop
threshold of loss decrease as 0.001. With the trained model
we get the cluster assignments which we used in the next step
to create virtual nodes and construct the heterogenous graph
dataset.
Heterogeneous graph
From the original graphs after we trained and computed the
clusters we will add one new virtual node for each of the clus-
ter. For K clusters, where K is a arbitrary number, we will add
K new virtual nodes. For each virtual node, we will add M
new edges between all the nodes in one cluster and the new
virtual node, where M is the number of the nodes in a clus-
ter. After virtual nodes connect the local nodes, we will fully
connect all the virtual nodes. To address the different proper-
ties of the edges from local nodes to local nodes, the edges
from local nodes to virtual nodes and the edges from virtual
nodes to virtual nodes, we applied the idea of Heterogenous
Graph Neural Network by using different message passing
convolution layers for different types of edges. [11]
Finally, here is the flow of our architecture diagram [Figure
1].

with a task of multi-label graph classification and citation
dataset. We used Average Precision as suggested by the au-
thors to analyze the results of our experiments. Our baseline
models are GCN, GAT, and GIN with the resampled citation
dataset graph [Figure 2].
After that, we also measure the models’ performance in two
of the datasets (Peptides-func & Peptides-struct) from LRGB
[2]. Figure 3 shows their performance.
As figures indicate, we achieved a similar performance as
SAN for peptides datasets, which is better than other common
Message-passing GNNs. Yet, we are way more efficient than
SAN.
DISCUSSION
As our model is not performing as well on the resampled
citation datasets, we proposes the following potential causes:
•The Cora dataset originally might not contain very impor-
tant long-range interactions, therefore after re-sample it’sstill not sure if the long-range interactions now contained
in the graphs are strong enough to have great influences on
the predictions.
•Cora dataset contains one single graph for node-level tasks.
While our models work well for graph-level tasks, the
cluster-method with the fully connected virtual nodes might
lead the graph to another side of over-smoothing. While we
used heterogenous GNN to try to address this possible issue,
that might still has an influence on node-level predictions
tasks.
There are still some limitations too. First of all, it will probably
not scale well when there are many clusters. For a larger
number of cluster, we could use sparse attention to better
model the interaction between these clusters. Second, while
we used several different datasets, the graphs’ sizes in peptides
datasets are relatively small. Last limitation is that the number
of the clusters has a large influence on the final performance
of the model and currently we have no better method but
cross-validation to chose a best cluter number. In the future
we will add the sparse attention mechanism along with more
experiments on graphs that are larger. For the cluster numbers
K we need a method to analyze the exact affect of the number
of the clusters to the performances of the models on different
graphs.
CONCLUSION
In this research we explored and proposed a new architecture
to help Message Passsing Neural Network to learn long range
interactions. We utilized the ideas of Spectral Clustering and
Heterogenous Graph Neural Network to decrease the diame-
ters of the of the new graph while maintain the original graph’s
topological structure unchanged. We compared the new results
with the baseline models including MLP and other GNNs and
confirmed our model’s improvements in terms of learning the
graphs with long-range interactions. Another contribution for
our model is to mitigate the issue of run-time complexity of
the models that relied on fully connected graphs’ attention
mechanism and transformer like SAN. Our model showed
comparable performances with SAN but with much smaller
run-time complexity.REFERENCES

ABSTRACT  
In this paper, we apply  a set of  transformer -based  techniques  to various Graph Neural 
Network (GNN)  architectures  and evaluate their effectiveness in capturing long-range 
interactions  in the graph . Our proposed methods encompass positional encoding, edge 
creation, and graph attention  and we examined for their  performances both cooperative ly and 
comparativ ely. These methods aim to address the limitations of long -range interactions 
between nodes in the graph structure, which can affect the quality of results obtained by GNN 
models.  Our results suggest that while  the effectiveness of each technique depends on the 
specific dataset and task, a joint application of transformer -based methods can significantly 
improve GNN models' ability to capture long -range interactions.  
 
1 INTRODUCTION  
The Graph Neural Network (GNN)  is a deep learning architecture  designed for learning  
graph -structured data,  which uses nodes and edges to represent information . Compared to 
tabular data,  the graph data are usually  characterized by its  lack of sequential or ders, thus 
resulting in  challenges  to apply common deep learning techniques on them.  The standard 
approach for processing GNNs is to perform message passing between directly connected 
nodes, and via repetitively  aggregating features through neighbouring no des and edges, the 
information could  diffuse from further away throughout  the graph.   While GNNs are  generally capable of  propagat ing information and capture the relationships 
between nodes, they can struggle to effectively capture long -range interactions in large 
graphs.  Ideally, a GNN of N layers can aggregate information from nodes N steps away. 
However, as the number of nodes grows larger, the number of steps to traverse and the 
amount of information to be encoded into one vector increase exponentially.  Another concern 
is that a  considerable amount of the information can be lost  during the message passing 
process, typically  at nodes with few connected edges  where the information are more 
compressed.  This issue is known as the oversquashing issue( (Alon and Yahav, 2020)  and 
remains as one of the most common optimization issues for GNNs. Many previous works 
have tried to address  the long -range interactions by proposing new types of GNN  operations , 
such as positional encoding, graph  attention and  adding additional edges at “bottleneck” 
nodes , while each approach results in additional computational costs.  This can make it 
difficult to train GNNs on very large graphs and to scale them to real -world applications.   
In this paper, we explored behaviors of different constructions  for capturing interactions in 
long-range graphs . The datasets we used include Pascal -VOC -SP, Peptides -func and 
Princeton Shape Benchmark (PSB) , with  first two come from the Long Range Graph 
Benchmark (LRGB)  collections (Dwivedi et al., 2022)  and the latter  one being a  standardized 
dataset for testing sh ape matche s(Shilane, Philip, et al. , 2004) . While the ordinary practices of 
the GNN do not necessarily require distinguishing long -ranged graph dependencies, the 
benchmark datasets are believed to demand such identification to achieve a satisfying 
performance, which makes them ideal for the context of this paper.  We’ve excerpted a table 
from the original dataset overview to demonstrate the scope of the work (Table 1). Among the 
two datasets, PascalVOC -SP deal with node -level superpixel pr edictions and uses the marco 
F1 score as the performance metric. On the other hand, the task of Peptide -func PSB datasets are to determine the category of the graph based on its global -level structure, and the average 
precision or mean average precision scores are used to evaluate the model performance.

2 METHOD  SUMMARY  
2.1 Datasets and Types of Tasks  
We used the cross entropy as the loss function for both node prediction and graph 
classification task. And for node prediction task specifically we tuned the cross entropy to 
also incorporate class weights to address the fact that the PascalVOC -Sp dataset contains 
60~70% of 0 label for each graph which constitutes to a unbalanced label distribution. 
Therefore, we wish to re -weight the loss function to prevent overwhelming false negative 
predictions. The seemingly low f1 score also reflected the imbalanced n ature of this dataset.  
Apart from PascalVOC -SP and Peptides -func which are well -organized dataset dedicated to 
graph data testing, we also employed the Princeton Shape Benchmark dataset, a standardized 
dataset for 3d model shape recognition, as a typical custom dataset from other domain to testify our methods. The primitive PSB dataset store data in the format of .off files rather than 
graph data. The format represents a mesh composed of vertices, edges, and faces. The file 
begins with a header line specif ying the number of vertices, edges, and faces , and is 
commonly used for representing  3D models in computer graphics.  By parsing the vertices 
and faces into nodes and shape edges to graph edges, we can easily create a transformed PSB 
dataset for graph data.  While the original PSB uses hierarchy categorization classes, e.g. 
“aircraft/airplane/F117”, in this experiment we would only uses the first hierarchy as the 
“super class” for the categorization task, as the nature of this experiment is not to test 
classi fication algorithm, but to investigate the long -rage graph interactions.  
For graph -level classification, the nature of the task reveal s a loosing demand on controlling 
class weight , and adding node -wise weight does not produce a visible influence on the r esult. 
Therefore, w e used the generic cross entropy loss  for evaluat ing graph -level tasks . To get the 
graph -level representation, we applied  a mean pooling  layer  to aggregat e node features from  
the graph , followed a 3-layer MLP classifier for  the final cla ssification. Since the goal of this 
project is to evaluate the graph neural network performance comparatively, the MLPs are not 
fine-tuned individually for different GNN structures in addition to the standard training 
workflow.   
 
2.2 GCN Model s  
We would test our transformer -based approach across some  of the most widely used GNN 
architectures, which are  Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), Graph Isomorphism Network 
(GIN), Graph Attention Network (GAT), gated Graph Convolutional Network ( GatedGCN), 
and Spectral Attention Network (SAN).  While the focus of this paper is transformer -based 
methods for GNNs, understanding the overview of the used GNN model pipeline s is also important for contextualizing the transformer -based approaches. A GNN model typically 
consists of several key components, such as graph convolutional layers, attention 
mechanisms, and gating mechanisms. These components can be modified and combined in 
different ways to create different GNN models, including GCN, GIN, GAT, gatedGCN, and 
SAN.  
In traditional GCN models, information is passed between neighboring nodes through 
message propagation, which limits the model's ability to capture dependencies among distant 
nodes. However, by incorporating transformer -based approaches, the GCN models ca n 
aggregate information from a much larger range of nodes, thus improving their ability to 
capture long -range interactions.  By understanding the components and architecture of these 
GNN models, we can better appreciate the specific challenges that arise in  capturing long -
range dependencies, which is the focus of transformer -based methods. Additionally, many of 
the transformer -based approaches build on existing GNN models or utilize similar 
components, so understanding the GNN pipeline is essential for under standing how 
transformer -based methods improve upon these existing models.   
GCN  
The Graph Convolutional network follows the path  
𝐻(𝑘)=𝑅𝑒𝐿𝑢(𝑊(𝑘)𝐻(𝑘−1)𝑄𝐺𝐶𝑁), 
where 𝑄𝐺𝐶𝑁=𝐷−1
2(𝐴+𝐼)𝐷−1
2  marks the graph Laplacian and 𝑊(𝑘) denotes the trainable 
parameters in the layer. Innately a spectral method, GCN is characterized by its inclination to 
local features. In GCN, each node aggregates information from its neighbours  through a 
linear transformation followed by a nonlinear activation function, resulting  in a new 
representation for the node. The final representation of each node is obtained by combining its original representation with its aggregated representation from the neighbours (Kipf and 
Welling, 2019).  
GIN  
The Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) takes the form  
𝐻(𝑘)=𝑀𝐿𝑃(𝑘)(𝑊(𝑘)𝐻(𝑘−1)𝑄𝐺𝐶𝑁), 
using a multiplayer perceptron for mapping the features (Xu et al., 2019), improved from 
GCN architectures. Unlike GCN, GIN can handle graph isomorphism, which means it can 
recognize that two different graphs a re actually the same in structure. GIN uses a learnable 
multi -layer perceptron (MLP) to aggregate information from neighbors, and applies the same 
MLP to each node in the graph.  
GAT  
The Graph Attention Networks  operates the  pair-wise attention scores  to weight the 
importance of neighbors during message passing (Brody et al., 2021) . It computes attention 
coefficients between pairs of nodes using a learnable function and  uses these coefficients to 
weight the hidden representations of the neighbors during aggregation. The GAT is suited for 
our experiment because it relies on  the attention mechanism locally without the spectral 
method . The addition of other transformer -based approaches such as positional encoding and 
edge creating are expected to enha nce its expressiveness.  Moreover, we can contrast the 
transformer -incorporated performance of GAT to those of GCN and GIN to investigate how 
does attention mechanism compares to other transformer -based methods.  
GatedGCN  
GatedGCN is a variation of GCN that uses gated recurrent units to model temporal 
dependencies during message passing (Li, Yujia, et al , 2015) . It computes the hidden representation of each node by combining its previous hidden representation with its current 
aggregated representation from the  neighbors. GatedGCN can effectively model the temporal 
dynamics of graphs and has shown strong  performance on various graph -related tasks.  
SAN  
The Spectral Attention Network (Kreuzer et al. 2021) applies a positional encoding to the 
graph data through the  whole Laplacian spectrum and passes the positional encoding to a all -
connected Transformer layer alongside node features.  SAN also uses a learnable Laplacian 
positional encoding scheme to encode the structural information of the graph. SAN has 
shown stron g performance on the benchmark datasets and can effectively capture long -range 
dependencies in graphs.  
 
2.3 Transformer -based  Approaches  
In our experiments, we examined the use of positional encoding, edge creation, and graph 
attention techniques, both independently and in combination.  We will evaluate the 
performance of these approaches on the PascalVOC -SP and Peptide -func PSB datasets, using 
the macro F1 score and average precision score as the evaluation metrics, respectively. Our 
results show that a joint application of these transformer -based techniques can significantly 
enhance GNN performance in capturing long -range interactions on graphs.  
Some of the GNN architectures that we used for testing have a built -in implementation of 
transformers, for instance, in SAN Laplacian positional encoding and full graph attention are 
used.  In this case, we’d modified the existing implementation instead of adding new layers of 
transformers. We did not, however, modify the baseline model for each mo del type for the 
purpose of comparisons.   
Positional Encoding  
We use Laplacian  positional  encoding and r andom walk encoding as the  two approaches for 
incorporating graph structure information into the node embeddings in graph neural 
networks.  
Positional e ncoding  inject s the relative position of nodes into the node features , which can be 
generated using the Laplacian matrix of a graph.  Given the  Laplacian matrix L = D - A, 
where D is the diagonal matrix of node degrees and A is the adjacency matrix , we can 
calculate the eigenvectors from it. The Laplacian eigenvectors can then be normalized and 
concatenated to for a vector representation for each node in the graph.  Positional encoding 
can provide additional information about the  global  structure of t he graph through local node 
features , allowing most GNNs to handle irregular graph structures.  
Random walk encoding , on the other hand,  is based on the idea of simulating random walks 
on the graph and using the resulting probabilities to encode information  about the local and 
global structure of the graph. Specifically, for each node in the graph, the random walk 
positional encoding generates a vector of probabilities that correspond to the likelihood of the 
node being reached by random walks of various len gths starting from every other node in the 
graph. These probability vectors are then used as additional features for each node in the 
GNN.  
Positional Encoding can be added to existing GNN architecture with minimal modifications 
and does affect the number o f trainable parameters which otherwise could increase the 
training complexity. The process of positional encoding  itself,  however,  demands heavy 
computations . Thus, one of the goals in o ur experiment  is to test whether it is efficient to add 
positional enc oding above other shortcut approaches .   
Edge Creation  
The oversuqashing issue is typical for large graphs because both the frequencies of bottleneck 
cases and the overall distance between node increase as the total number of nodes increase  
(Dwivedi et al., 2022).  Adding supplemental edges can potentially decreases the level of 
information compression at certain nodes, and thus mitigating the oversquashing problem. To 
determine which node to add edges, we use the probability weight p = a / d(i,j)2 where a is a 
learnable parameter. And we use an overall dropout rate as a marginal limit to determine the 
maximal proportion of edges to be added.  
Creating new edges address the long -range interactions at the cost of increasing message 
passing computations . However, as  the message passing process is one of the fundamental 
unit integrated in the current  GNN code base, it’s computation  is mostly  optimized and 
scalable , which means it could  less susceptible to  the addition of  comput ing comp lexity  as 
compared to the previous two approaches.   
Since the number of edges  to add is entirely dependent on the specific structure  of a graph , 
both the effectiveness and the drawbacks of this approach can be difficult to measure. On the 
other hand, posit ional encoding is an approach that reduces the structure sensitivity and can 
be feasibly combined with most architectures. Therefore, we combined two approaches to test 
if any synergized effects can be produced.   
 
Graph Attention  
Graph attention is a mechanism used in GNNs  to allow nodes to attend to different neighbors 
based on their importance, rather than aggregating information from all neighbors equally  during the normal propagations . This can help to address the issue of long -range interactions 
in graphs, as it allows  nodes to attend  to distant neighbors that may have a greater impact on 
their representation.  Throughout the experiment, we developed different approaches of 
constructing the graph attention. For choosing which no de pairs to generate attention scores, 
we tried random selection(with learnable parameters) and weighted selection by distance 
using p = a / d(i,j)2 as discussed in the “Edge Creation” section.  
In graph attention, there are two main approaches for determi ning attention scores: global 
attention and partial attention. The choice between these two approaches will depend on the 
specific task and graph being considered, and the desired trade -off between accuracy and 
computation time.  Given the scope of dataset sizes and graph sizes in our tests, global 
attention is computationally expensive. While it’s believed that the substitutes for partial 
attention might be outperformed by full graph attention,  given the scope of dataset sizes and 
graph sizes in our tests, full attention is computationally expensive  and is sometimes not 
affordable . Using partial attention  allows a reasonably run -time mitigation , especially when 
comb ined with other computationally heavy transformers, while preserving the advantage of 
attentio n scores in storing the global structure of a graph. Hence, our primary focus is  the 
partial attention.   
 
3 RESULT  
While the transformers -based methods pose additional computational cost upon models, the 
inclusion of t hese approaches in G NN models can significantly reduce the potential training 
time required to achieve state -of-the-art performance , which otherwise must  be achieved by 
adding more layers . This is particularly important in large -scale graphs, where the number of 
nodes and edges can be prohibitively large  that disallows continuing adding layers . By reducing the computational burden, transformer -based approa ches allow for the development 
of more efficient and scalable G NN models, enabling the characterization of long -range 
interactions in even larger graphs.  Table 2 to Table 4 summarizes our findin gs comparing the 
model which generates the best metrics to the  baseline model  for each model type. See 
appendix  for a full collection of  training result from  all combinations of transformer -based 
method.  
 
3.1 Metric  Perfo rmance  
Our modified transformers have enabled a significant reduction in training time for models 
compared to the previous results in LRGB . The Spectral Attention Network, which originally 
had two spectral mechanisms causing high computational burden, now require s only 1.7 
hours on average to run with improved performance over the LRGB (Dwivedi et al., 2022) . 
The training time has been reduced from  around  60 hours to an average of 2 -3 hours. While 
it’s believed that the substitutes for partial attention might be ou tperformed by full graph 
attention, it allows a reasonably run -time mitigation when combing with other 
computationally heavy transformers, while preserving the advantage of attention scores in 
storing the global structure of a graph.  
In general,  the experi mental findings suggest that the use of additional transformers  can lead 
to improved performance on all the testing dataset s. The results  reveal that the inclusion of 
partial graph attention to the GNN  leads to a more notable enhancement in model 
performan ce as compared to the performance gains from  the utilization of positional 
encoding and edge creation techniques  solely . For PSB, the GNN shows a strong 
improvement from results of using shape descriptor functions in Shilane’s original paper , 
which ranges  0.213 for all -label classification to at best 0.416 for classifying one specific category ( Shilane, Philip, et al. , 2004) . It’s expected that  the addition of transformers also 
yields relatively the greatest  improvements on PSB than other 2 d atasets , as the PSB had 
more nodes and thus demands more handling to capture the long -range interactions.  
As the benefits of the transformer -based approaches  vary depending on the specific task and 
graph being considered , we’ve also witnessed some minor di screpancies from our results.  On 
the Pascal -VOC -SP dataset, for instance , the performance increase by adopting partial 
attention in replacement of full graph attention is less significant. On the other hand, for PSB 
dataset , the edge creation techniques do es not improve the performance, since the PSB is a 
dataset used for 3d shape recognition and  by its nature it had almost twice as much nodes 
from the Pascal and Peptides datasets, the addition of artificial edges could possibly impair 
the recognizable shape of the existing 3d meshes, revealing the circumstantial nature of this 
method.

3.2 Run Time Efficiencies  
As previously mentioned, the transformer -based approaches we explored include attention 
mechanisms, positional encodings, and edge creation. We found that incorporating these 
methods into the GNN pipeline result ed in significant improvements in accuracy compared to 
the baseline models. To address the trade -offs between improvements and the computational 
complexity , we evaluated the performance of the transformer -based approaches based on 
their training time and e ventual metrics .  In figure s below , we presented  a contrast between our transformer -based methods and the 
originally unchanged model which we would call them baseline. While the actual efficiency 
varied depending on the specific dataset and the particular model type, in general we could 
summarize that th e set of transformers which best improves the models do not simultaneously 
result in a significant ly unacceptable  run-time increase.

It's worth noting that the  relative improvement of model performance on the Pascal -VOC  
dataset is considerably lower than on the Peptides -func dataset. This may be due to 
differences in the characteristics of the graphs  and structures.  Additionally, our modified 
partial attention mechanism and positional encoding yields a negative impact on the Pascal -
VOC  dataset  for SAN models, though the edge creation contribute to a positive effect. The 
reason for such odds is not clear at the curren t stage, and further investigations are required to 
conclude a plausible reason  beyond dataset specificity.  
 
4 CONCLUSION  
In conclusion, we have explored the effectiveness of various transformer -based approaches in 
improving the performance of graph neural  networks. Our findings suggest that incorporating 
transformer -based approaches can lead to more efficient and scalable GNN models that can 
effectively capture long -range interactions in larger graphs. Our result shows that the addition 
of partial graph at tention can significantly increase the model performance more than 
positional encoding and edge creation does. Combining positional encoding and/or edge 
creation with attention can further enhance the performance by capturing both local and 
global structur al information. Moreover, the transformer -based approaches significantly 
reduce the training time required to achieve state -of-the-art performance.  Future research 
could explore on the generalization capabilities of transformer -based GNNs to new and 
unseen  graphs .

Abstract
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have seen tremendous success in re-
cent years, leading to their widespread adoption in a variety of appli-
cations. However, recent studies [1] [5] have demonstrated that GNNs
can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks allow ad-
versaries to manipulate GNNs by introducing small, seemingly harmless
perturbations to the input data, which can lead to misclassification or un-
expected behavior from the GNN. Such attacks can have drastic impacts
on security and privacy, particularly in safety-critical or privacy-sensitive
applications. Consequently, research into adversarial attacks on GNNs is
becoming increasingly important, and we thus propose a novel adversarial
attack that is described in the following section.
1 Introduction
Adversarial attacks on graph-based models are attacks where an adversary de-
liberately introduces small perturbations to the input data to fool the target
model. The perturbations can be crafted in such a way that they are not easily
noticeable to human observers but can have a significant impact on the model’s
output. Recently, adversarial attacks have become a hot topic in the field of
deep learning, particularly in the context of graph neural networks (GNNs).
Adversarial attacks on graph-based models are useful for several reasons.
Firstly, they can help researchers better understand the limitations of graph-
based models and identify their vulnerabilities. By understanding the types
of perturbations that can be introduced to the input graph to fool the target
model, researchers can develop more robust models that are less susceptible to
attacks. Secondly, adversarial attacks can be used to improve the robustness
of graph-based models. By training models to recognize and defend against
adversarial attacks, researchers can improve the model’s ability to handle noisy
or incomplete data, which is a common problem in real-world applications.
1Finally, adversarial attacks can be used for malicious purposes, such as to deceive
a target model or to manipulate the results of a graph-based system. It is
therefore important to develop robust adversarial defense mechanisms to protect
against such attacks.
A lot of previous studies have been conducted on related topics. For instance,
a direct perturbation on the original graph (removal or addition of edges) is
feasible in order to change the topological order of the graph. In addition,
changing node features to completely transform the feature matrix of the graph
has also been popular. However, those manual changes are not natural enough
for the model to learn. A more recent study on GraphRNN has introduced
the idea of a natural generation of attacks. Given the time-series nature of
the model, GraphRNN will only generate one node at a time, given the context
vector from the previous iteration. Such a generation of nodes would presumably
preserve the topological order of the original graph while only making trivial
changes that are not perceivable to humans. This work has shed light on our
approach, as we will go into more detail in the next few sections.
We thus introduce a framework that consists of three parts: Generator
(GraphRNN), Inverter (Embedding + MLPs), and Discriminator (MLP). For
the embedding part, we first attempted with Graph2Vec and later switched to
Graph Attention Model (GAM). The main advantage and contribution of this
framework is that it provides a more effective and robust method for adversar-
ial attacks on graph-based models. By using a Graph Attention Machine as
a substitute structure, the framework addresses some of the limitations of the
previous attack setup, such as unnatural manipulation. The resulting model is
theoretically more accurate and less prone to overfitting, which makes it more
useful for real-world applications. Overall, this framework represents a signif-
icant step forward in the development of more effective adversarial attacks on
graph-based models.
2 Network Architecture and Attack
The network that will generate adversarial examples has two components: a
generator G:Z → X and an inverter I:X → Z . On a high level, the network
executes the attack as follows: after GandIhave been trained, the inverter
finds the latent space representation z=I(x) of some benign input x∈ X,
and then we repeatedly use a search strategy to find an element z′of the latent
space close to zsuch that x≈ G(z) andG(z′) are also close with respect to the
graph metric but the attacked model assigns to them different classes. [2]
3 Notation
LetXbe a set of graphs - i.e. it contains graphs ( V, E) such that Vis a set of
vertices and there exists N∈Z+andE∈ {0,1}N×N. LetZ=RLbe a latent
space. PXis the data distribution on X, andPZis a distribution on the latent
2space - most likely it will be a normal distribution, since many generative models
use elements drawn from the normal distribution as inputs to their generative
models.
Xis a metric space when equipped with the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW)
distance, which is defined as follows. [2] Let ( X, eX, µX) and ( Y, eY, µY) be
metric measure networks, which are generalized notions of graphs, albeit without
node features - we will use the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance to measure
distances between graphs with node features. For the purpose of this report, eX
andeYmay be taken to be indicator functions, although more generally they
are allowed to be measurable functions. Additionally, we take µXandµYto be
uniform distributions.
Let Π be the set of couplings between µXandµY, i.e. the set of probability
distributions on X×Ywhose marginals are µXandµY. Then the first-order
GW distance between metric measure networks ( X, eX, µX) and ( Y, eY, µY) is
abbreviated as dGW(X, Y) and is defined as:
dGW(X, Y) := inf
π∈ΠZ
X×YZ
X×Y|eX(x, x′)−eY(y, y′)|∂π(x, y)∂π(x′, y′)
The first-order Wasserstein distance between probability distributions will
also be useful and is defined as:
W(µX, µY) := inf
π∈ΠZ
X×Y||x−y||2∂π(x, y)
Given a Lipschitz continuous function f,||f||Lis its Lipschitz constant.
|| · || 2is the standard Euclidean norm; whether it applies to RorRLwill be
determined by context.
4 Network Training
We use GraphRNN [6] as Gθ, where θare the parameters, and train it to mini-
mize W(PX,Gθ(PZ)), which by the Kantovorich-Rubinstein duality, equals
max
||f||L≤1Ex∼PX[f(x)]−Ez∼PZ[f(Gθ(z))]
f:X → Ris a feedforward neural network, with some modifications. f
computes various summary statistics of the input graph, such as node degree
distribution and clustering coefficient distributions, and processes each statistic
through separate networks with tanh activation functions; each network maps
toR. Then, fpasses their outputs through a linear combination, where the
weights are learn-able, followed by another tanh. Explicitly, fhas form:
f(G) =tanh(NX
i=1aifi(G))
3where {fi}are the separate networks mentioned previously, {ai}are learn-
able weights, and Nis the number of statistics to compute.
Next, we train an off-the-shelf graph2vec model [4] Jmapping from Xto
Z′, after which we train an inverter Iγ:Z′→ Z. From now on, the parameters
ofJare fixed. With the parameters of the inverter I=Iγasγ, we denote Iγ
to beIγ◦ Jfor convenience. Fix some λ >0.Iγis trained according to the
following objective:
min
γEx∼P(X)[dGW(Gθ(Iγ(x)), x)] +λEz∼P(Z)[||Iγ(Gθ(z))−z||2]
Having trained GθandIγ, the attack may be executed as follows [Figure 1]:

5 Implementation
5.1 GraphRNN
1. It is an autoregressive model that can generate graphs of arbitrary size,
providing the inverter with a diverse pool of graphs with different charac-
teristics.
2. Unlike earlier approaches, such as GraphVAE, GraphRNN can process
large graphs on limited hardware resources. Experiments with GraphVAE
show that on a single GPU, the maximum number of nodes in a graph is 38.
In comparison, on datasets of molecules and social networks, GraphRNN
can generate graphs of hundreds of nodes.
3. In its original form, GraphRNN generates new graphs in a stochastic and
autoregressive manner from an initial hidden state of a zero vector. We
propose to replace this hidden state with an element of latent space. Dur-
ing both of our training procedures, we pass latent space elements that
are either generated from a standard normal distribution or that are out-
putted by the inverter.
We started with the original implementation of GraphRNN and developed
our training loop around it. GraphRNN’s architecture contains two modified
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models. The modified GRU is a wrapper around
the PyTorch GRU. The wrapper connects the GRUs with two 2 sets of linear
dense layers. The intention is to add to the expressiveness of the model and
remove the effect of variation in sequencing the adjacency vector.
The modified GRU doesn’t take the original adjacency matrix of the graph
as input; instead, the author intended it to accept a sequenced version of the
adjacency matrix, which is smaller in size and this will lower the runtime. The
sequence is done with Breadth-first search from an arbitrary starting node.
Formally, one modified GRU model generates the next node of the graph,
whereas the other GRU model connects the new nodes to existing nodes. The
5first GRU model is named graph-level RNN and the second model is named
edge-level RNN. Theoretically, the graph-level RNN and the edge-level RNN
work in a nested fashion as shown in the pseudocode. The outer loop calls
the graph-level RNN to decide whether a new node will be generated or not.
Then the inner loop calls the edge-level RNN to iterate through all existing
nodes and update the edge connections between them. In short, the graph-level
RNN updates the node list, and the edge-level RNN updates the edge list of
each node. After the edge lists are generated and normalized with sigmoid, the
adjacency vector is then generated from these lists using a sampling technique.
From the adjacency vector, a graph adjacency matrix can then be constructed.

Training of the graph-level RNN and edge-level RNN is done with teacher
forcing, meaning the loss is calculated with the ground truth. The procedure
uses binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizers. The binary cross entropy
loss is calculated by comparing the packed version of the generated adjacency
vectors with the packed version of the ground truth. There are no nested it-
erations involved during training to avoid discontinuity in backward gradient
graphs.
Graph generation is done differently to accommodate customized graph sizes.
The number of nodes in the generated graph is specified by the user, and the
graph-level RNN is run with the same number of iterations. The output of the
graph-level RNN is also passed into the edge-level RNN iteratively to create the
output adjacency matrix.
We tested the GraphRNN model by switching the initial hidden layer with
a noisy input sampled from a normal distribution [Figure 2, Figure 3]. After
1000 iterations of training, the GraphRNN model is generating results that are
comparable to the ground truth. The generated samples have a tendency to be
more dense than the original graph. In the original iteration, it is recommended
to train for at least 3000 iterations for the model to output realistic graphs, so
this is a respectable result.

5.2 Graph2Vec
Graph2Vec [4] is a graph embedding model. Given a graph adjacency matrix,
Graph2Vec embeds it into a 1-dimensional vector with a fixed size. The imple-
mentation of Graph2Vec is based on Doc2Vec. Similar to Doc2Vec, Graph2Vec
relies on a skip-gram model of the graph, where each graph is encoded by its
subgraphs, similar to how each document in Doc2Vec is encoded by its context
words. We are using the Graph2Vec implementation provided by the Karate
Club python library.
We need to get a constant-size representation of graphs as the input to the in-
verter. Graph2Vec is trained every forward pass with the generated graphs. The
corresponding graph embedding is then retrieved from the Graph2Vec model
and serves as the input to the inverter.
We are unable to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the Graph2Vec
embedding; however, the embedding output maintains a constant size and the
inverter is successfully trained with the embedding as the input. We also experi-
mented with connecting Graph2Vec with the discriminator in training procedure
[Figure 1]. We encountered failing gradient backpropagation with our module,
due to the poor integration between PyTorch and Karate Club, and we are
unable to train the generator with this setup. For this reason, we decided to
switch to other alternatives for training procedure 2 [Figure 6].
6 Results
To evaluate the output of the GraphRNN after training with Wasserstein Loss,
we plotted the distribution of the generated graphs’ embeddings and compared
it to the original graphs’ embeddings. [Figure 4] The result shown above is
generated with the MUTAG dataset.
For the original graph, we colored each graph’s data point according to its
labels. In MUTAG, there are two labels, so each point is colored in one of two
colors.
7Figure 4: (Left) The original graphs’ Graph2Vec embeddings after encoded
by t-SNE to 2-dimensional space. (Right) The generated graphs’ Graph2Vec
embeddings after encoded by t-SNE to 2-dimensional space.
For the generated graph, because we don’t have assigned labels to generated
graphs in our training procedure, we can’t apply the same coloring technique.
But looking at the shape of the embedding distribution, we can see that they
aren’t very different.
One interesting observation is that the generated embeddings are relatively
sparse at some points, and the local distributions look linear at places where
the real graphs aren’t. This could mean that our training isn’t effective enough
to capture the underlying distribution of the original dataset.
The loss plot of all three components [Figure 5] supports that the training
procedure has serious underlying issues. As shown in the above plot, the loss
value of all three components stagnates after the initial 10 epochs of training.
One possible explanation for this is the generating GraphRNN is not being
properly trained, so the training of the inverter and the discriminator is being
bottlenecked by the poor performance of the generator.
7 Conclusion
During our training, we realize there are several challenges we need to resolve.
The first challenge is to ensure our models the property of permutation invari-
ant. This is one of the major failures with the first training procedure. In
our framework training, a graph can be represented by an adjacency matrix,
which is a matrix that indicates which nodes in the graph are connected to each
other. However, the adjacency matrix of a graph can vary depending on the
node ordering used to represent the graph. This means that the graphs from
a particular dataset (say, MUTAG) can have multiple adjacency matrices de-
8Figure 5: Loss plots of the discriminator (Multi-layer perceptron), the inverter
(Graph2Vec + Multi-layer perceptron), and the generator (GraphRNN) after
100 epochs of training.
pending on the ordering of the nodes, which can make it difficult to train if our
models are vulnerable to different orderings of the nodes.
Incompatible back-propagation of gradients is another challenge yet to be
resolved. First, the gradients can become unstable or vanish during back-
propagation when the models are highly interdependent. For example, in the
case of an adversarial attack on GraphRNN, the generator model’s objective
is to generate perturbations that can fool the discriminator model, which is in
turn trying to detect the perturbations. The gradient updates for the generator
and discriminator models are highly interdependent and can lead to instability
during training. An even more fatal thing is that PyTorch backpropagation is
not compatible with our implementation of Graph2Vec. In other words, tensors
passed into Graph2Vec will not have any gradient to train on. This is the reason
we switched to GAM for our embedding technique.
In the context of an adversarial attack model, graph manipulation functions
are necessary to generate perturbations to the input graph that can fool the
target machine learning model. This involves adding or removing edges, chang-
ing node attributes, or altering the overall structure of the graph. However,
PyTorch does not provide native support for these operations, which can make
9it difficult to implement the adversarial attack model efficiently.
8 Appendix A: Training Procedure v2
After implementing the first training procedure, we observed poor training loss.
The stagnated loss suggests the Wasserstein loss is insufficient to train the gen-
erator. As a result, the discriminator and the inverter stop improving after 10
epochs of training. This calls for an overhaul of the first training procedure.
We decided that one probable cause for this failure occurs in the discrimina-
tor and inverter. We experimented with two types of inputs with both models.
First, input the graph adjacency matrix, and then pass in the Graph2Vec em-
bedding. The Graph2Vec embedding approach failed due to technical incom-
patibility between Karateclub and PyTorch autograd. And while the vanilla
adjacency matrix approach worked, it is still problematic because the adjacency
matrix doesn’t provide a deterministic description of graphs. The discriminator
can discern the real example from a generated example abusing the properties
of the adjacency matrix (e.g. artificial padding), which are not necessarily rele-
vant to the graph. As demonstrated by the high loss value in the early epochs,
GraphRNN’s output graphs are unrealistic and unreliable. The Wasserstein
distance is calculated with the discriminator’s output to train the generator.
Yet, the Wasserstein loss considers only the realness score from the discrimi-
nator; there is no description of the difference between the distribution of the
generated graphs and the distribution of the sampled graphs. With this loss,
the generator receives no information on how the generated graphs should look
like.
To combat this issue, we switch from a WGAN style training procedure to a
new autoencoder style procedure. The discriminator model is removed, and the
encoder is pre-trained with other downstream tasks (e.g. graph classification).
In addition, the encoder is now replaced with a Graph Attention Machine instead
of Graph2Vec. [Figure 6]
9 Appendix B: Graph Attention Machine
Graph Attention Model (GAM) [3] is a neural network-based approach that
can learn node embeddings by focusing on the relevant nodes in the graph using
attention mechanisms. GAM can capture the local and global information of
the graph and is particularly useful when the graph is large and complex. GAM
is also flexible and can be easily adapted to different types of graphs. Most
importantly, GAM approach is compatible with PyTorch autograd, whereas
Graph2Vec from Karateclub does not.
The GAM architecture typically consists of multiple layers of graph attention
modules. Each graph attention module takes the node features and adjacency
matrix as input and computes the attention coefficients for each node in the
graph. It is trained by optimizing a loss function that measures the discrepancy
10Figure 6: Training Procedure v2.
between the predicted node embeddings and the ground-truth node labels. The
loss function in our case is a logmax that differentiates between predicted and
ground truth labels. The loss is back propagated through the network to update
the model parameters, such as the attention coefficients and node embeddings.
This process is specifically done using the Adam optimizer.

1 Abstract
This paper investigates the performance of three machine learning approaches for community
detection on two distinct datasets: the CORA academic citation network and a Twitch
user dataset. The CORA dataset presents a challenging testbed for community detection
algorithms, as it represents a citation network of scientific papers in computer science, while
the Twitch Gamer dataset captures the two-sided friend relationships between Twitch users.
Our first approach uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that considers only node features,
while the second approach uses another MLP that only considers graph data. The third
approach employs a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) that combines both node
features and graph data. We evaluate the performance of these models on both datasets by
comparing the results to the ground-truth labels provided by the authors of the datasets. Our
results demonstrate that the GCN model outperforms the two MLP models on the CORA
dataset, whereas on the Twitch dataset, the MLP model that uses graph data performs
better. However, further investigation is necessary to improve the performance of the GCN
model that combines both graph and node features. This study emphasizes the importance of
considering both node features and graph data for community detection in complex networks
and underscores the potential of GCNs for this task.
2 Introduction
2.1 Definition of Community Detection
Community detection, commonly referred to as graph clustering or network clustering, is a
task in network analysis which is used to identify groups or communities within a given net-
work. These groups are usually characteristic of dense connections between nodes within the
group, as compared to the connections of these nodes to the nodes in the rest of the network.
Community detection in a network is important and interesting because it can provide use-
ful insights to the structural organization of a network that can be applied to many diverse
real-world networks. Given the enormous amount of information contained in each network,
the detection of communities within them would provide valuable insights and facilitate the
study of the network. Moreover, the detection of communities within networks can enhance
the efficiency of processing and analyzing network data. For instance, in social media, each
user represents a node, and the users’ interactions with their friends create connections that
form a network. Community detection algorithms can be leveraged by social media compa-
nies to identify groups of users with common friends, interests, and backgrounds, therebyimproving the personalization and effectiveness of recommendation systems and advertise-
ments. The identification of communities within a network can also provide insights into the
mechanisms by which the network spreads in different contexts. Community detection has
another valuable and significant application in finding missing or erroneous links within a
network. By leveraging community detection algorithms, users can assign and rectify these
links. Although several clustering algorithms have demonstrated good performance, they
fail to incorporate additional dataset or node features. To address this limitation, we aim
to investigate and compare the performance of various neural network models that leverage
different features of the dataset for link prediction.
2.2 Overview of Datasets
2.2.1 CORA Dataset
The CORA dataset is a benchmark dataset used in the field of machine learning and nat-
ural language processing. It contains research papers from computer science and contains
the following information: title, abstract, authors, publication venue, content, and citation
information. In the context of community detection, the CORA dataset can be represented
as a citation network, where papers are represented as nodes, and citations between papers
are represented as edges. The dataset has 2,708 nodes and 10,556 edges. The node features
we use in our models consist of 1,433 word vectors that were pre processed using natural
language processing. Our models utilize node features comprising 1,433 word vectors, which
underwent pre-processing via natural language processing techniques. These word vectors
are derived from the most frequently occurring words in all the papers and are employed to
gauge the similarities between them. This citation network can then be used to study the
underlying structure of scientific communities. The papers are classified into one of seven
classes which are:
1. Case Based
2. Genetic Algorithms
3. Neural Networks
4. Probabilistic Methods
5. Reinforcement Learning
6. Rule Learning
7. Theory
The CORA dataset is a widely adopted benchmark for assessing the efficacy of text clas-
sification models, graph-based machine learning algorithms, and semi-supervised learning
algorithms. Given its prevalent usage in research and considerable contributions in diverse
domains, we selected this dataset as the standard benchmark for evaluating the performance
of neural networks on community detection.
22.2.2 Twitch Gamer Dataset
The Twitch Gamer dataset was compiled using public APIs in spring 2018. This dataset
comprises nodes representing Twitch users, while node features include attributes such as
views, maturity rating, lifetime, account status, and affiliate status. The objective of our
investigation was to detect communities, with the communities being defined based on the
language spoken by the users. The dataset consists of 168,114 nodes and 6,797,557 edges,
and is well-suited for a variety of tasks, including node regression, node classification, link
prediction, and community detection.
Given the broad range of available node features, the Twitch Gamer dataset can potentially
enable the development of innovative approaches for community detection that leverage di-
verse characteristics of the network’s nodes. For instance, incorporating the lifetime feature
into a neural network model may enable the identification of long-term users who are more
likely to be part of stable communities, while the affiliate status feature may provide insights
into the type of content that users consume and promote.
Overall, the Twitch Gamer dataset represents a valuable network to explore the effectiveness
of machine learning models for analyzing social network data. By evaluating the performance
of different approaches on this dataset, we can gain insights into the strengths and limita-
tions of various machine learning algorithms, and further advance our understanding of how
to leverage node features to improve the accuracy of community detection models.
32.3 Analysis of Dataset
We analyzed the degree distribution and community structure of a network, focusing on com-
munity topology. Community topology refers to the way communities are structured within
a network. To determine the existence of communities, we calculated the community den-
sity, which measures the density of edges within and between communities. If a community
structure exists in the graph, we expect to observe a higher density within communities than
between them. The density of edges is defined by whether they connect nodes within the
same community (in-community edges) or nodes in different communities (out-community
edges). The in-community density is calculated based on the density of in-community edges.
This approach enables us to gain insights into the community structure of a network and
the patterns of connectivity between nodes. The in-community density is defined as:
density =number of edges in-community
number of edges out-community
2.3.1 Degree Distribution
Figure 1: CORA Log Degree Distribution
As shown in Fig. 1, the degree distribution of the CORA citation network dataset exhibits
characteristics of a power-law distribution, common to many real-world networks. A power-
law distribution is a statistical pattern where the frequency of occurrence of events decreases
4rapidly as the magnitude of the event increases. This distribution suggests the presence of
hub nodes, which have significantly more connections than most nodes in the network. The
majority of nodes in the dataset have a low degree, while a small number of nodes act as
hubs, possessing a high degree of connections. Hub nodes are nodes with a high degree of
connections. Hub nodes are critical in network analysis as they play a significant role in the
network’s overall connectivity and function.
Figure 2: Twitch Log Degree Distribution
Fig. 2 shows a plot of degree distribution for the Twitch dataset and indicates that its
degree distribution follows characteristics similar to the previously mentioned CORA dataset.
Specifically, the distribution of degrees in the Twitch dataset appears to follow a power-law
distribution as well. As a result, the majority of nodes in the Twitch dataset have a low
degree, while a small number of nodes act as hubs with a high degree of connections. T
The similarity in degree distribution between the CORA and Twitch datasets suggests that
both datasets have comparable network structures, where a small number of hub nodes play
a significant role in the overall connectivity and function of the network.
2.3.2 Community Analysis
The following are some key words are used for this section:
•Internal Density: Proportion of edges that exist within a community.
5•Positive Density Gap: Difference between the density of edges within a community and
the average density of edges outside that community. A positive density gap indicates
that the community is more densely connected internally than with nodes outside the
community.
•Average Density: Proportion of edges that exist within a network as a whole.
•Negative Density Gap: Difference between the density of edges within a community and
the average density of edges outside that community. A negative density gap indicates
that the community is less densely connected internally than with nodes outside the
community.
Note: Detailed CORA Community Analysis data is in Appendix Table 3.
In the CORA dataset, all communities exhibit a higher internal density, as represented
by the positive density gap. The average density of these communities is relatively large,
with a density gap of 0.6199. This suggests a clear community structure within the dataset
in terms of community topology.
Note: Detailed Twitch Community Analysis data is in Appendix Table 4.
For the Twitch language communities, some communities have a negative density gap, indi-
cating lower in-community density than out-community density. However, these communities
are typically small in size. The average density of the Twitch language communities is char-
acterized by a significant density gap of 0.799. While the English (EN) community shows a
clear community structure, other communities are less significant and difficult to detect in
terms of community topology. Therefore, this dataset exhibits a weak community structure
in terms of community topology.
3 Methods
3.1 MLP on Node Features
The first neural network we tested on the dataset was a Multi-Layer Perceptron constructed
specifically to work with purely node features. This network architecture comprised three
linear layers. The first layer accepted the node feature matrix provided by the dataset,
followed by Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation. The second layer comprised 64 neurons
as input and 32 neurons as output, which were subsequently fed into another ReLU activation
function. The third and final layer consisted of 32 neurons as both input and output, and it
predicted which community a node belongs to.
63.2 MLP on Graph Data
The second MLP tested on the dataset was designed to operate with a focus on graph data
alone. This MLP architecture was constructed in a manner similar to the first MLP, with
two linear layers and two ReLU layers of the same size. The first linear layer was followed by
a ReLU activation function, while the second linear layer consisted of 64 input neurons and
32 output neurons that were subsequently fed into another ReLU layer. Finally, the third
linear layer comprised 32 input neurons and generated the community prediction for a node.
3.3 GNN on Node Features + Graph Data
For this community detection algorithm, we used a Graph Convolutional Neural Network
constructed to take advantage of node features and graph data. The GCN architecture
comprises a Graph Convolutional Layer that accepts the node feature matrix and edge
indices as input and generates 64 output channels. This layer is subsequently followed
by ReLU activation, and a second Graph Convolutional Layer with 64 input channels is
employed to predict the community membership of each node. The output of this layer
represents the final community prediction.
4 Results
4.1 Performance Metric for the Algorithms (Classification Accu-
racy)
Each neural network was evaluated by their classification accuracy as the proportion of nodes
correctly categorized to their true community divided by the total number of nodes in the
data. A high classification accuracy suggests that the model performs well in predicting
which community a node belongs to while a low classification accuracy implies that the
model is poor at classifying which nodes belong to which community. Accuracy was chosen
as the metric for its simplicity and the fact that other metrics like sensitivity and specificity
work on the assumption that the prediction task is classification. Since there are many more
communities than two, metrics like sensitivity and specificity are not viable for our analysis.
4.1.1 Model Performance on CORA dataset
The models’ performance on the CORA dataset is displayed in Table 1 below:
7Model Accuracy
Multi-Layer Perceptron on Node Features 77.12%
Multi-Layer Perceptron on Graph Data 72.69%
Graph Convolutional Neural Network 90.04%
Table 1: Results of CORA dataset
The results of the models on the CORA dataset demonstrate that the GCN incorporating
both node features and graph topology resulted in the highest classification accuracy when
compared to the other two models evaluated. The other two models yielded sub-par accura-
cies of around 75%. These results were expected since the CORA dataset has relevant node
features and a well-defined community structure which makes it well suited for community
detection. More specifically, since the relevant node features can be utilized independently
for community detection, we anticipated that the MLP model employing node features would
yield somewhat satisfactory classification accuracy. We also expected that the MLP model
using graph structure would provide similar performance. Hence, since both node features
and graph topology contribute to predictive accuracy, the GCN model is naturally capable
of delivering superior performance relative to the other two models.
4.1.2 Model Performance on Twitch dataset
The models’ performance on the Twitch dataset is shown in Table 2 below:
Model Accuracy
Multi-Layer Perceptron on Node Features 74.16%
Multi-Layer Perceptron on Graph Data 89.10%
Graph Convolutional Neural Network 74.08%
Table 2: Results of Twitch dataset
Unlike what we observed for the CORA dataset, the results from the Twitch Gamer dataset
are counter intuitive. The model with the best performance is the model of MLP with graph
structure. Despite the GCN using node features and graph topology, it does not lead to a
better classification accuracy. Although we did implement adaptive learning rate to avoid
over-fitting the models, it is still possible to over-fit. The findings from the analysis of the
Twitch Gamer dataset provide valuable insights. The data revealed that the EN (English)
language community constitutes approximately 74% of the dataset which makes sense since
most Twitch streamers stream in English. The MLP model which uses node features and the
GCN model had similar accuracies of around 74%. It is possible that these two models were
unable to fit the data and only generate random predictions. Upon analyzing the dataset,
we identified that the node features including views, maturity, lifetime, account status, and
affiliate may not be closely related to the community, which could explain the inability of
8the models to fit the data. The MLP model with graph structure demonstrated the best
performance, achieving 89 .10% accuracy, which shows that using solely graph structure might
be more suitable depending on the type of network. Therefore, it is likely that utilizing node
features negatively impacted the performance of the GCN model, despite its incorporation
of graph structure information.
5 Discussion
5.1 Strengths and Weaknesses of each Algorithm
5.1.1 MLP on Node Features
The Multi-Layer Perceptron working solely based on node features makes it a simple al-
gorithm to utilize for community detection. The model does not need a set of nodes and
edges to deploy, so it is able to perform in the absence of graph data. However, its simple
dependence on the node features means that if the node features are not predictive of which
community a node belongs to, the model is bound to perform poorly. Also, the model can
only perform so well in the absence of further information like the nodes and edges of the
graph data.
5.1.2 MLP on Graph Data
The strengths of using a MLP for community detection using only graph data are its sim-
plicity and flexibility. MLPs are straightforward models that can easily handle simple linear
relationships between input and output data, making them well-suited for processing graph
data. They are also flexible and can be easily modified to accommodate different types of
graph data. Additionally, MLPs can generalize well to unseen data, making them well-suited
for community detection tasks where predictions need to be made on new, previously unseen
nodes. The weaknesses of using an MLP for community detection include limited model ca-
pacity, the potential for overfitting, and insensitivity to graph structure. MLPs are limited
in their ability to capture complex non-linear relationships between input and output data,
which can result in suboptimal performance on large and complex graphs.
5.1.3 GNN on Node Features and Graph Data
The graph convolutional neural network makes use of both the node features and set of nodes
and edges given in the data to predict communities. The model depends on the existence
and quality of both the node features and graph data, so having both is a prerequisite to
implement this neural network. To its advantage, it has more potential to perform well
precisely because it can use more data to make predictions. A disadvantage of the GCN
is that it can result in flawed predictions when the node features are not closely related
to the underlying communities they belong to. Another disadvantage can occur when the
community structure of a network is indistinct, indicated by a low or negative community
9density difference. In such cases, the graph structure does not facilitate community detection
for traditional clustering algorithms or the GCN. However, GCNs can leverage node features
to optimize the model, which gives them an edge over traditional algorithms.
5.2 Comparison of Results
5.2.1 CORA Dataset
A comparison of the results of three models for community detection on CORA dataset
shows that the GCN performed the best, achieving an accuracy of 90 .04%. The MLP
which used node features had the second-best performance, with an accuracy of 77 .12%.
However, the MLP which used graph data showed a lower accuracy of 72 .69%. These results
indicate that incorporating node feature information into the model can lead to improved
performance in community detection tasks. The GCN, which was specifically designed to
process node features and graph data, demonstrated the best results, while the MLP on Node
Features showed a significant drop in accuracy when only using node features. These results
highlight the importance of considering both node features and graph structure information
in community detection tasks.
5.3 Twitch Dataset
The analysis of the Twitch Gamer dataset revealed that node features can sometimes have a
detrimental effect on the predictive capacity of the models. While the results from the CORA
dataset suggest that incorporating both graph structure and node features can improve
performance, the findings from the Twitch dataset indicate that irrelevant node features can
reduce the predictability of the models, as shown by how model performance dropped by
about 15% when incorporating both graph structure and node features compared to only
graph structure. As previously mentioned, the node features in the Twitch Gamers dataset
are probably not directly related to language communities, and including these extraneous
features in the models substantially diminishes their predictive power.
6 Conclusion
6.1 Summary of Findings
The GCN model which used graph data and node features worked best at detecting com-
munities on the CORA dataset, and, thus, we can get following conclusions:
•Using both components of the data led to a substantial improvement in accuracy, when
both graph structure and node features are predictive.
The MLP on solely the graph structure performed the best on the Twitch Gamers dataset,
and, hence, we can say that:
10•Using node features could have brought the accuracy down, and since the MLP on
node features and GCN incorporated it, they had lower accuracy. Therefore, the node
features are not as predictive as the graph data on the Twitch dataset, and node
features mislead the model.
We can conclude that incorporating both graph structure and node features in a model,
when both are predictive, would result in improved performance. This is because the model
can leverage more predictive information, which would naturally improve its performance.
However, if the information provided to the model is unhelpful or misleading, it would not
contribute to its performance and may even bring it down. All in all, the best performing
model depends on the quality of the data, so it is important to be flexible and use whichever
is best for the situation.
6.2 Recommendations and Implications for Further Research
So far, the models included in this analysis were assumed to work on graph datasets where the
edges were undirected, unweighted, and had no features. Assuming and going off of the result
that the neural network that employed more data performed better, it may be interesting to
further look into either creating new models or complicating our graph convolutional neural
network that can account for datasets with directed and undirected edges, edge weights, and
edge features to better improve predictions. A possible place to start could be inputting
edge weights into the graph convolutional layers included in our graph convolutional neural
network since edge weights are an optional input to feed into the layer, suggesting it should
be possible to work with edge weights. Then from there, dive deeper into bringing in more
data like edge directions and features.

19","This paper investigates the performance of three machine learning approaches for community detection on two datasets: the CORA academic citation network and a Twitch user dataset. The first approach uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that considers only node features, while the second approach uses another MLP that only considers graph data. The third approach employs a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) that combines both node features and graph data. The results show that the GCN model outperforms the two MLP models on the CORA dataset, whereas on the Twitch dataset, the MLP model that uses graph data performs better. However, further investigation is necessary to improve the performance of the GCN model that combines both graph and node features."

The algorithm is found to be effective in identifying and dividing communities into clusters. The study focuses on the followers and followings of users on Twitter to explore communities within the social media platform. Using a seed account of a modern-day rap musician named Dessa (@DessaDarling), distinct communities were uncovered and analyzed.

The paper discusses technological innovations that have led to the growth of data networks and the natural formation of communities within them. Communities are typically defined by common variables such as location or interest in a public figure. As networks grow, so do the number of connections and communities, making analysis challenging.

Data was gathered from Twitter using a breadth-first search approach with the Followers/Following API. A dataset was curated containing connections between Twitter accounts, represented as nodes in a graph.

The Louvain community detection algorithm is based on modularity and uses a recursive format for accuracy. It assigns nodes to communities and iteratively evaluates whether moving a node to another community increases accuracy.

Ten unique communities were identified and analyzed for common characteristics such as geographical location or profession. The findings suggest that undetected communities exist within social media networks that can be accurately uncovered using the Louvain algorithm.

Further research is needed to determine the potential applications of these algorithms in community detection across different social media platforms since only one platform's data was used in this study. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research, including testing the Louvain algorithm's performance individually on various social media platforms and creatively overcoming API limitations during data collection.

1 Abstract
Recent work introduced the vast unfolding of community detection in large
networks, in which a heuristic methodology not only identifies communities,
but also measures the density between nodes in modules that highlight the
strength of a subcommunity. It was shown that such clustering methodologies
can facilitate community detection with the benefits that include exceeding
other clustering algorithms in time complexity. In this paper, we focus on
using CESNA (Communities from Edge Structure and Node Attributes) in order
to combine both methodologies to see if we can categorize music artists by
genres based on the Spotify playlists they are in. By using a combination of
the generated network’s edges and the attributes of each artist, CESNA was
able to construct 7 distinct communities with 53% of artists in each community
matching the top genres (such as indie-pop) in each respective community and
82% of artists matching the general genre of each community.
2 Introduction
Networks are everywhere, from the social interactions of our daily lives to
the complex systems of technology and infrastructure that underpin modern
society. However, while basic concepts of network analysis can be traced back
to the 18th century (when Leonhard Euler published one of the first known
papers on graph theory) [2], it was not until the last few decades that advances
in computing power and data collection techniques have made it possible to
analyze large-scale network data in a systematic and rigorous manner. Today,
network analysis is a vital field of research with applications in fields ranging
from biology to social science to computer science. By structuring data in such
a way that nodes are linked together by edges if they share a relation (much like
how users on a social network are connected if they are friends), new analysis
techniques can be used to take advantage of this unique data structure.
When analyzing the information within various data networks, communities
form naturally within them through connections between individual points of
data, or nodes. However, as more individual nodes of data are added to the
1data collection, the number of connections between nodes and the number of
communities formed to represent these connections grows exponentially, creating
difficult problems to overcome when analyzing the data in a timely manner.
3 Related Work
It’s important to note that grouping data has been a challenge that we have
been trying to solve, and can be achieved using “clustering” algorithms, where
using multiple attributes for each data entry can be used to find similarities and
differences between them to create “clusters”. However, the idea of locating
and recovering communities is focused on networks as analysis largely relies on
a key component of the data structure - the edge. This is where the idea of
the planted clique problem was first presented: identifying the subset of nodes
in a network that have something in common, determined by the density of
edges in a network. The challenge was constructing an algorithm to do so that
could perform in efficient time. Methods to achieve this in polynomial time
were introduced in 1995 by Ludˇ ek Kuˇ cera [4], and improved upon in 1998 by
Alon, Krivelevich and Sudakov [1]. Both proposed constraints to the size of the
planted clique relative to the network, where the planted clique could be found
with high probability. More recently, the paper “Computational Lower Bounds
for Community Detection on Random Graphs” [3] observes that there are cal-
culations to clearly define three bounds that determine the level of difficulty
to retrieve a planted clique: simple, hard, and impossible. These bounds are
based off the size of the network and size of the planted clique (or community)
is. This prior research exposes a drawback in graph data, given that some situ-
ations cannot be optimized at all.
Figure 1: The general bounds describing the difficulty of a given community
detection problem [3].
2Traditional approaches for community detection, such as the planted clique
problem, have focused on identifying dense subgraphs in the network. However,
these methods may not be optimal for networks with overlapping communities
or complex features. This has led to the development of alternative approaches,
such as CESNA, that leverage additional information beyond the network topol-
ogy. By considering both edges and features, CESNA can provide a more nu-
anced understanding of the communities in the network, which is essential for
many real-world applications.
CESNA takes a different approach for detecting communities by using a
combination of the network architecture as well as the specific features of each
node. By considering both sources of information from the data independently,
CESNA is able to better understand and assess which nodes best belong in each
community. While there do exist other algorithms which take both edges and
features into account, CESNA is able to outperform them when dealing with
networks that feature overlapping communities, an important distinction given
how interconnected some communities can be in networks.
Figure 2: Two ways of modeling the statistical relationship between a graph G,
attributes X, and Communities F. Circles represent variables that need to be
inferred while squares represent observed variables.
There are four method classes for community detection in networks that we
will use in comparison to CESNA. First is the Heuristics method class which
refers to the set of algorithms that identify communities in a network using sim-
ple rules. The most popular heuristic method is the Girvan-Newman algorithm,
which repeatedly removes edges with the highest connectedness centrality (num-
ber of shortest paths in the network that pass through an edge) until the network
is divided into communities. Second is the LDA (Latent Dirichelet Allocation)
which is used to model the distribution of nodes based on their connections
to other nodes where the nodes are treated as ”documents” and the edges are
treated as ”words”. Third is the Clique-based heuristics class which is a set of
algorithms that identify cliques or subsets of nodes that are fully connected to
each other in a network. Nodes belonging in the same clique are most likely
to belong to the same community. Lastly, the social circles method which is
based on the social network concept that people who share common interests
form social circles where nodes are connected based on the similar attributes or

From this table, we see that CESNA can detect overlapping communities,
assigns hard node-community memberships, allows dependence between the net-
work and node attributes, and the most efficient method class for community
detection in networks with node attributes.
4 Data Description
Our primary source of data is a dataset of Spotify playlists collected by
Andrew Maranh˜ ao, which is freely available on Kaggle [6]. This dataset was
collected using a subset of users who published their nowplaying tweets via
Spotify. This tabular dataset lists a row for each song that was tweeted out,
containing the name of the song, the artist of the song, and the playlist that
song was playing from. While the data also contained the user IDs of each
person who tweeted the track they were listening to, our model does not take
personal information as input.

Table 2: Breakdown of Dataset
We began our initial analysis of the dataset by removing any rows that con-
tained missing information as well as playlists that only contained a single artist.
4We then randomly sampled 2000 playlists from our dataset, and increased the
threshold to only keeping artists that were in at least 10 playlists. A graph was
then generated by iterating through artists within playlists and generating edge
weights between artist nodes. Initially, this gives us a novel perspective on how
artists are connected through their appearances in playlists.
Figure 3: Visual insight into how artists are connected through their appear-
ances in playlists.
5 Methods
On a technical level, in network G, each node has K attributes, and there are
C communities in total. The node attributes are represented in a binary matrix
as X where Xu,kis the k-th attribute of node u. Additionally, we consider a
community membership matrix F, where we assume that each node u has a
non-negative affiliation weight Fu,c∈[0,∞) to community c. If Fu,c= 0 then
node u does not belong to community c.
For implementation, the adjacency matrix is constructed from nodes defined
to be artists, where an edge is denoted by two artists existing in the same
playlist. Our node attribute is constructed by calculating total playlist appear-
ances by artist and identifying the top 25% threshold of appearance count. The
attribute is the binary representation of whether that artist’s total appearances
is above the threshold.
The CESNA algorithm infers communities through four assumptions:
•Nodes that belong to the same communities are likely to be connected to
each other
•Nodes can belong to multiple communities
•Nodes with more communities in common are more likely to be connected
than those with less in common
5•Nodes in the same community share common attributes
These assumptions are satisfied because: 1. edges are created from shared
community memberships (edges are created if artists are in the same playlist),
2. Each node represented in the community membership matrix F is considered
an independent variable which allows a node to belong to multiple communities,
3. Each member in community c has independent connections, so those with
more communities in common are more likely to be connected than those with
less, and 4. We can predict the value of each node’s attributes based on a
node’s community membership. The objective function we are trying to solve
is then ˆF,ˆW= argmax L(G) +L(X) where L(G) =logP (G|F) and L(X)
=logP (X|F, W ). We break L(G) and L(X) into two subproblems by fixing
community memberships F and weights W for each node and update F and W
at the end of each iteration of gradient ascent.
6 Results
Using the CESNA algorithm, we identified seven distinct communities from
the Spotify dataset. To assess the accuracy of our algorithm, we evaluated
the top three genres in each community and computed the percentage of nodes
within each community that have any of these three genres. We also used gen-
eralized genre for our accuracy metric here because there are several sub-genres
of a main genre for example indie-pop and dance-pop which we believe that
including all under the term pop is appropriate.
Figure 4: The same network, now assigning a color to each artist based on which
community CESNA found them most likely to be in.
The first community detected belongs to the rock genre, containing 496 edges
or playlists and includes popular bands such as Bon Iver and One Direction. The
6genre accuracy of this community is approximately 45.4%, while the accuracy
of the generalized genre improved to 78.8%.
The second community we identified is a dance pop genre group with only five
edges, including artists such as Charli XCX, Demi Lovato, will.i.am, Naughty
Boy, and The Pussycat Dolls. Given the small size of this community, both the
genre accuracy and the generalized genre accuracy are 100%.
The third community is also a dance pop genre group with 76 edges, includ-
ing artists such as John Mayer and Adele. The genre accuracy of this community
is 60.5%, and the accuracy of the generalized genre is about 87%.
The fourth community is a hip hop genre group with only eight edges, featur-
ing popular artists like Kendrick Lamar, Drake, and Lil Wayne. The genres of
this community include hip-hop, rap, and pop. The genre accuracy of this com-
munity is 75%, and the accuracy of the generalized genre improves to 87.5%.
The fifth community is another dance pop genre group with 26 edges, in-
cluding artists such as Britney Spears and Snoop Dogg. The genres of this
community include dance pop, pop, and pop rap. The genre accuracy is 69.2%,
and the generalized genre accuracy is 88.5%.
The sixth community is the second community in the rock genre group with
a generalized genre of rock which has 17 edges including artists such as Beck
and Red Hot Chili Peppers. The genres of this community include rock, modern
rock, and pop rock. The genre accuracy of this community is about 65%, and
it improves to 94% when we generalize the genre.
Finally, the last community we detected in our model also belongs to the
rock genre with a generalized genre of rock. It has a community size of 148 edges
including artists such as Coldplay and Arctic Monkeys. The genres of this com-
munity include rock, pop, and dance. The genre accuracy of this community is
about 68%, and the generalized genre accuracy is 86%.
Overall, the total accuracy of the original genres associated with each artist
is 53%, which improves to 82% when we generalize the genres. Looking at a
single data point in its original form, we are only able to identify the playlists an
artist is featured on. Using this network we can quickly identify several similar
artists, not just limited to those in the same playlists. In a practical sense, a
network like this can be used to generate new playlists or discover similar artists.
7 Conclusion
In conclusion, our study explored the use of CESNA algorithm for com-
munity detection in a network of music playlists. By leveraging both edge
structures and node attributes, we identified seven distinct communities where
the nodes shared common genres. Our evaluation of the accuracy of the com-
munities showed that most communities achieved 60% or higher accuracy, with
an overall improvement from 53% to 82% when generalizing the genres. These
results suggest that CESNA can be a useful tool for identifying communities in
dense networks with basic attributes.
Moreover, our study highlights the importance of considering node attributes
7in community detection algorithms. By using node attributes such whether an
artist was within top 25% of artist appearances, we were able to identify com-
munities of playlists that are not only structurally similar but also share simi-
lar musical characteristics. This approach could be extended to other domains
where nodes have additional attributes, such as user preferences or geographical
location, to better capture the underlying communities in a network.
Finally, our preliminary work shows that given a dense network and a few ba-
sic attributes, CESNA was able to achieve a good accuracy score. This promis-
ing result suggests that we are reaching a new turning point in community
detection in growing, denser networks. As networks become increasingly com-
plex and multi-dimensional, community detection algorithms that can effectively
leverage both network structure and node attributes will become increasingly
important. We hope that our study will inspire further research in this direc-
tion and contribute to the development of more powerful community detection
methods.

Abstract
Deep learning has been growing rapidly over the past couple decades due to its
ability in solving extremely complex problems. However, this machine learning
method is often considered as a ""black box"" since it is unclear how the neurons of
a deep learning model work together to arrive at the final output. A recently found
method called Network Dissection has solved this interpretability issue by coming
up with a visual that shows what each neuron looks for and why. Results show
that groups of neurons detect different human-interpretable concepts. Inspired by
Network Dissection, we will be investigating methods to improve a convolutional
neural network’s prediction power based on the knowledge of the role of each
neuron. One such method is FocusedDropout: keeping neurons that focus on
human-readable concepts while discarding everything else. Additionally, the effect
of regularization of input gradients on model robustness and interpretability is also
tested.
1 Introduction
Deep Neural Networks consist of a large number of hidden layers and units, the functionality of
which we are not fully aware. While we may understand feature engineering at the input level and the
final output classification, the intermediate hidden features are somewhat of a ""black box"". It is not
clear how the network is solving a task of high complexity. However, it has been observed that many
hidden units are actually associated with concepts that are human-interpretable. Thus, it becomes
important to really understand the functionality and contribution that each of these hidden units has to
the final output of the network. In order to understand this, network dissection is used - a method to
correlate semantic concepts identified within a complex convolutional neural network (CNN) [1]. It
aims to identify, visualize and quantify the contributions of each individual unit within a deep CNN.
Findings from network dissection show us that different groups of neurons correspond to different
human-interpretable concepts such as trees, snow, etc. Taking this one step further, the goal of this
paper will be to find out if we can improve a network’s prediction accuracy given this information
regarding each neuron’s roles. Until recently, most methods that aims to improve neural networks
do not include specific knowledge about these networks, such as regularization and fine-tuning. A
method that we will implement in this paper is FocusedDropout: a dropout method that retains
36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022).neurons that contain target-related features while discarding other neurons [2]. Additionally, we
are also incorporating input gradient regularization, which involves minimizing the rate of change
of loss with respect to the input features [3]. This is said to improve the robustness as well as the
interpretability of the network.
2 Network Dissection
A strength of network dissection is that the key idea relates to analyzing the visual concept associated
with units within the network, which is a concept that image-based neural networks employ. Thus,
network dissection can be applied to a wide range of models rather than specific model architectures
for which the algorithm is particularly designed. While this does restrict network dissection to
image-based tasks, the versatility of network dissection streamlines the understanding of this type of
model significantly. In addition, network dissection can be applied to multiple tasks as long as the
units learn relations to visual concepts. This is exemplified within this paper as network dissection is
applied to image classification. The variety of tasks and model architectures that network dissection
applies to without the need for heavy customization makes it a powerful tool to analyze the role of
individual hidden units and find insights about the black box natures of neural networks.
The first step in training a network on a scene classification task is to identify units that are capable
of detecting objects. In this paper, we use the Places365 dataset from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Scene Recognition Database
[4] to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using the VGG-16 architecture to classify images
into 365 scene categories. Since the last convolution layer has the most object-detecting units [1], we
mainly focus on conv5_3 layer.
The units compute activation functions au(x, p)that output a signal at every position p of the image
given a test image x. Bilinear upsampling facilitates the visualization and analysis of filters with
low-resolution outputs. Denote by tuthe top 1% quantile level for au: That is, writing Pxp[·]to
indicate the probability that an event is true when sampled over all positions and images, we define
the threshold tu≡Pxp[au(x, p)> t]≥0.01. Activation regions above the threshold are highlighted
in visualizations by {p|au(x, p)> tu}. Fig.2 shows how this region corresponds to semantics, for
example, the heads of everyone in the picture. We use a computer vision segmentation model [5] that
predicts the presence of the visual concept c within image x at position p based on the agreement
between each filter and the visual concept c. sc: (x, p)→ {0,1}is trained to identify filters that
match semantic concepts. Using the intersection over union (IoU) ratio, we quantify the agreement
between concept c and unit u:
IoUu,c=Px,p[sc(x, p)∧(au(x, p)> tu)]
Px,p[sc(x, p)∨(au(x, p)> tu)]
This IoU ratio is computed on the set of held-out validation set images. Within this validation set,
each unit is scored against 1,825 segmented concepts c, including object classes, parts of objects,
materials, and colors. Then, each unit is labeled with the highest-scoring matching concept. Fig.3
shows several labeled concept detector units and the five images with the highest unit activations.
Within layer conv 3, we find 512 units matching 51 object classes, 22 parts, 12 materials, and eight
colors. In some cases, more than one unit matches the same visual concept. Fig.1 shows the frequency
of units matching segmented concepts with unit types in layer conv5_3, excluding units with IoU
ratios of 4 or 4%. A total of 28 object classes, 25 parts, nine materials, and eight colors can be
detected by units at the last convolutional layer, while the total number of object parts peaks two
layers earlier, at layer conv5_1, where units match 28 object classes, 25 parts, and nine materials.

3 Methods
3.1 Method 1: Network Dissection Intervention
Network dissection intervention is the process of modifying internal representations to improve the
performance of the network on a specific task. For example, if a network is trained to recognize
images of cars, but it is found that it has trouble distinguishing between different models of cars,
network dissection intervention can be used to identify the units that are responsible for recognizing
different car models and modify them to improve performance on this task. As we use Places365
data, we calculate the accuracy for every 365 classes by removing one unit at once and determine
which unit assists the network by increasing accuracy. After dividing units into good and bad, we
reduce the weights or output of bad units.
33.2 Method 2: FocusedDropout
FocusedDropout is a highly targeted approach that makes the network focus on the most important
features (based on the idea of Network Dissection) while dropping other features. The methodology
for FocusedDropout is shown in Figure 4. To get a visual understanding of FocusedDropout, Figure
5 shows the process of creating the binary mask that will be applied to every channel based on the
highest activation channel. For this paper, we will be using VGG-16 for the CNN and CIFAR-100 for
the dataset.
Figure 4: FocusedDropout Algorithm
Figure 5: FocusedDropout Binary Mask
3.3 Method 3: Input Gradient Regularization
Input Gradient Regularization was initially introduced as ""double back-propagation"", and involved
training neural networks by minimizing quadratic loss of the network as well as the rate of change
of loss with respect to the input features. In this particular implementation, cross-entropy loss is
used instead. The goal of this approach is to ensure that even if any input changes slightly, the
KL divergence between predictions and labels will not change significantly. In turn, it serves as an
interesting means to prevent adversarial attacks. In our paper, we aim to implement this method to
check for general improvement in network accuracy, and combine it with network dissection to check
for improved accuracy and interpretability. We formulate our overall loss function for this method as:
The object function is presented more concisely as:
44 Experiment & Results
4.1 Network Dissection Intervention
For Network Dissection Intervention, we trained VGG-16 on Places365 and experimented with
conv5_3 layer as the layer had units that captured most objects. To test the hypothesis, we performed
the following steps:
1.Unit Deletion Analysis: We calculated the accuracy of the VGG16 model with and without
each unit in layer conv5_3 to identify the best and worst performing units
2.Unit Activation Analysis: We modified the output of layer conv5_3 for the worst and
best-performing units and reevaluated the accuracy of the model
3.Weight Modification Analysis: We modified the weights of layer conv5_3 for the worst and
best-performing units and evaluated the accuracy of the model
For both modifying unit output and weights of the layer, we experimented with dividing and multi-
plying constant numbers and stopped the experiment when the accuracy got below the baseline. The
results are shown in Table 1.
Table 1: Network Dissect Intervention Accuracy
Unit Type & Target Baseline Divide/Multiply 2 Divide/Multiply 3
worst unit output division 76.58% 76.52% 75.91%
worst unit weight division 76.58% 76.6% 76.02%
best unit weight division 76.58% 76.35% 75.56%
4.2 Input Gradient Regularization & FocusedDropout
For FocusedDropout and Input Gradient Regularization, we trained our VGG-16 on CIFAR-100 with
the following training settings:
• Batch size of 128
•Stochastic Gradient Descent Optimizer (Learning rate = 1e-2, momentum = 9e-1, weight
decay = 5e-4)
• CosineAnnealingLR Scheduler (T_max = 200)
• 150 Epochs
For input gradient regularization specifically, we made use of the L2 norm for regularization with a
penalty of λ= 0.1.
The classification results are shown in Table 2.
Table 2: Accuracy of VGG-16 on CIFAR-100 (150 epochs)

FocusedDropout par_rate 0.1 90.71% 72.90%
L2 (lambda 0.1) Input Gradient Regularization 99.92% 71.67%
4.3 Network Dissection on reported and experiment models
After training VGG-16 on CIFAR-100, we performed Network Dissection on it and compared the
results with that in the original Network Dissection paper (VGG-16 on Places365).
The results are shown side-by-side in Figure 6.
5Figure 6: VGG16 Masks for Places365 (left) and CIFAR100 (right)
5 Discussion
Based on the images from Network Dissection, we see that VGG16 on CIFAR100 does not detect
scenes that well while the reported result (VGG16 on Places365) shows clear classifications of
high-level concepts. This is highly suspected due to the fact that CIFAR100 is a dataset that revolves
around object detection while Places365 is a dataset that revolves around scene detection. This
difference in the datasets might prevent our model from learning high-level concepts. Additionally,
CIFAR100 is a subset of a much bigger dataset and we feel that using a larger dataset will also allow
for better generalization and conceptual understanding.
A next step for this project would be to train our VGG16 models on Places365. This was not done in
this project due to limited resources: it was estimated to take around 50 days for our model to train
on Places365 for 100 epochs with our GPU. As a result, we stuck with CIFAR100 for this project.
Through this project, we see that a network’s information can be utilized to manipulate the network
to achieve better performance.

Abstract
Although neural networks have proved very effective in solving a range of tech-
nological and scientific problems, our knowledge of how they work hasn’t kept
up with their progress in practice. We can develop fresh and efficient strategies to
enhance neural network performance by identifying the underlying mechanics that
underlie these systems. In order to construct recursive feature machines (RFMs),
which are kernel machines that learn features, we focus our study on the essential
mechanism underlying feature learning in fully connected neural networks. Our
results demonstrate the superior performance of RFMs over a variety of models
and a variety of data types.
1 Introduction
1.1 Background
In recent years the world has seen large, billion-parameter models achieve extremely high levels of
accuracy at tasks previously thought to be difficult for machine learning models. However, researchers
begin to question why these large parameter models work significantly better than more traditionally-
sized models. One approach to this problem is to analyze kernel methods, specifically kernel functions
which are a type of algorithm used to solve non-linear problems with linear classifiers. Different
types of kernels such as the polynomial or Laplacian kernel transform the data into higher dimensions
to solve the linear separability problem. Additionally, we want to compare neural networks to
recursive feature machines which are simply kernel machines that learn features from deep fully
connected neural networks and fill the gap between kernel machines and fully connected networks. A
key mechanism between feature learning in neural networks can be isolated by connecting feature
learning with a statistical estimator for feature selection which is known as the expected gradient
outer product. Recursive feature machines can capture features learned by deep networks and can
achieve state-of-the-art performance on some tabular data that we will compare against both kernel
methods and neural networks and comment on the mathematical basis of our results. In this paper,
we compare n-gram models and Laplacian kernel machines to recursive feature machines that utilize
Preprint. Under review.a feature matrix that is a driving feature in neural networks for text data and gain an understanding of
the performance differences between the three methods. We also look at the theory behind recursive
kernel machines by analyzing the eigenvalues of the kernel matrix.
1.2 Related Work
Previous work has been done in analyzing kernels for machine learning (Hofmann et al., 2008). The
authors of the paper explain that kernel methods are based on the idea of using a kernel function to
map data from the original input space to a higher-dimensional feature space, where the data can be
more easily separated by a linear classifier.
The authors describe different types of kernel functions, such as polynomial, Gaussian, and sigmoidal
kernels, and discuss their properties and applications. They also describe how kernel methods can be
used in different machine learning tasks, such as support vector machines, kernel principal component
analysis, and kernel density estimation.
However, no research has been done on trying to understand why certain datasets are better suited for
kernels than others. Further research has also been done the use of GPUs for large batch training
on kernels (Ma and Belkin, 2018). Ma’s work creates the basis for parallelizing kernel training
by loading data and weight matrices onto a GPU where linear calculations can happen orders of
magnitude faster. Some research has also been done on understanding the phenomenon of transition to
linearity of certain neural networks as their width approaches infinity (Liu et al., 2020). This provides
a new perspective on the NTK’s role as an approximator of (linear) neural networks. However, the
transition to linearity only holds when the last layer of the neural network is linear.
Previous work has also been conducted to develop kernel machines that learn features. Since kernel
machines are classical learning models that are generally easy to implement (Adityanarayanan Rad-
hakrishnan, 2022). Neural Tangent Kernels are a specific kernel that have been effective at classifying
images but have under performed compared to neural networks. Recursive Feature Machines aim to
learn features and become data-adaptive to estimate a predictor with a kernel machine and average
gradient outer product to update the feature matrix which causes feature learning.
1.3 Datasets
We will be using a text novel dataset in this project:
1.1984 (Orwell): 1984 by George Orwell is a ebook novel with 9456 lines with 64 characters
each and utilizes a context size of 48 characters.
The text will be webscraped to extract raw words from the document and build a vocabulary of 50
words with alphanumeric characters to tokenize the text. The characters will be one hot encoded
to create a matrix with the number of samples for dimensions rows (N) and the token size (64) by
vocabulary size (50).
2 Methods
For points that are randomly distributed, classifying them using a linear classifier is a complicated
task as they are generally not linearly separable. The problem of linear separability scales with the
dimensionality of the dataset, as linear separability must produce a hyperplane as a linear combination
of all dimensions.
Kernel methods come in handy in these situations because they transform the points with respect to
the rest of the dataset before classification. The basic structure of a radial kernel (the focus of this
paper) is as follows:
K(x, y) =exp−||x−y||t
Ω
γ
2The key parameters in this kernel ( Ω,t,γ) can be modified to produce different kernels. For example
the Laplacian kernel (which is used in all experiments in this paper) is created when Ω = 1 and
t= 1. The Gaussian kernel (sometimes called the RBF kernel), is produced when Ω = 2 andt= 2.
γis the bandwidth parameter – it governs how ""wide"" the kernel is, and will affect the classification
performance based on the dataset.
After rewriting our data points using the formula above, we get regression model weights:
ˆα= (K(X, X) +λIn)−1y
Where λis a regularization parameter. The above formula also gives us some insight into the effect of
γ; namely, when γ→0,K→I, which causes ˆα→y. On the other hand, when γ→ ∞ ,K→1.To
get the training and test predictions, we use ˆαas follows:
ˆy=sign(K(X, X)ˆα)
ˆy′=sign(K(X′, X)ˆα)
Note that these pairwise kernel machines require the storage of the entire training dataset X, even for
inference. This imposes a severe performance restriction on them as K∈Rn×n, which when nis
large, makes it difficult to store Kon most modern computers, much less invert in order to find ˆα.
In future portions of this project we will explore more advanced kernel machines that use random
fourier features to approximate Kusing Monte-Carlo sampling. However, one should note that these
kernel machines are highly efficient when dis large and nis small, since they effectively reduce the
dimensionality (and therefore the size) of the dataset in such domains.
In deep neural networks, the expected gradient outer product is a statistical estimator for feature
selection in feature learning. Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs) are a class of kernel machines that
learn features using this expected gradient outer product as denoted below.
Γ(g) =1
nnX
i=1∇g(xi)∇(xi)T∈Rd×d
Kernel machines also must use a kernel function in the form K: Rd×Rd→Rso with that kernel
function and a dataset (X,y) ∈Rd×n×R1×nthe predictor ˆfis depicted as below:
ˆf= ˆαK(X, x); ˆa=yK(X, X)−1
Mwill be a positive semi-definite and symmetric matrix that will be a learnable parameter in the
kernel function. We then consider kernels of the form
KM(x, z) :=ϕ(||x−z||M).
Now the kernel regression with the kernel function KMcan be used estimate a predictor then using
the average gradient outer product to update the feature matrix M.
Using the algorithm above, we analyze the 1984 dataset by predicting a specific character based on
previous characters. We use a weighted bag of word method in which we start by tokenizing our text
into characters. We then encode the characters into numerical representations by assigning vectors to
each characters. When predicting a character, we also assign more importance/weight to characters
closer to the the item we are trying to predict.
32.1 N-Gram Model Baseline
The N-Gram model is a language model that finds the probability distribution over word sequences.
We will develop two N-gram models of 3 and 4 grams respectively which calculates the probability of
a word based on the previous 3 words. It will utilize a context size of 48 words which is the window
of words to predict the context of each word.
2.2 Laplacian Kernel Method
The Laplacian kernel machine utilizes an encoded matrix where each token is replaced with its index
in the vocabulary. Then it is one hot encoded into multiple matrices split for training and testing data
and its respective labels. We can obtain the sequence of the next characters and train the Laplacian
kernel by finding the solution of the kernel and the next character and call this â. We then obtain
the resulting matrix by solving that kernel at â to obtain ˆy. We can plot this ˆy to visually see the
next-character accuracy in the figure below.
Figure 1: Next Character Accuracy Plot
We then calculate this ˆy with the context size for the train dataset and decode the text and slide the
window forward and return the transpose for the results. We then join it all together to receive a text
of the results and append the Bleu Score and Perplexity metrics to our findings.
2.3 Recursive Feature Machine
The Recursive Feature Machine requires the Training features X, training labels y, Kernel Function
Kand number of iterations T. We create the feature matrix called Mthat is a prominent feature of
neural networks that is a square matrix whose size is d x d where dis the number of features. We
then train the Kernel Function Kwith M.
KM(x, z) =exp−∥x−z∥M
σ
where ∥x−z∥M:=q
(x−z)TM(x−z)
Thus, ∇KM(x, z) =Mx−Mz
σ∥x−z∥MK(x, z)
We update M where M=1
nP
x∈X∇f(x)∇f(x)Twhere ∇f(x) =α∇KM(X, x). We then cross-
validate and repeat the previous steps until it converges. After training, we receive an αand generate
a text kernel with the kernel RFM function, alpha, and the training and testing encoded matrices. We
join the output and create a list of text that we can evaluate our bleu and perplexity scores on.
2.4 Scoring Metrics
Bleu Score - Bilignual Evaluation Understudy is a metric to measure and compare the similarity of
translated texts ranging from 0 (perfectly mismatched) to 1 (perfectly matched). It compares
the original and translated corresponding n-grams to each other and averages all the n-grams
to compute the final Bleu Score.
4Perplexity - A metric that measures the amount of ""chaos"" that exists in the text dataset. The lower
the perplexity score is, the more ""predictable"" the generation of the text is. Conversely, the
higher the perplexity score, the more likely the less ""predictable"" the generation of the text
is.
3 Results
3.1 Score Comparison
Comparing the RFM to the bigram/trigram model and the Laplacian kernel model, we get the results
in the table below:
Results
N-gram Laplacian RFM
Bleu Score 0.449 0.453 0.472
Perplexity 15.36 9.08 11.53
Figure 2: Next Character Accuracy Plot for RFM
3.2 Scaling Test Findings
Figure 3: Scaling Plot Test with Baseline
54 Conclusion
4.1 Baseline Methods vs RFM Results
From these results table between the three methods, we see that the RFM has the highest Bleu score,
meaning that it performed best at predicting text. However, the Laplacian Kernel Machine had the
lowest perplexity meaning that it produced the most ""predictable"" text out of the three methods.
4.2 Recursive Feature Machine Next Character Accuracies
Figure 2 compares the next character accuracy of the RFM generated characters (left) with the actual
next character accuracy of the original text (right). Each row corresponds to a one-hot encoded vector
denoting the next character in the sequence, with lighter colors corresponding to a higher predicted
probability.
4.3 Scaling Test Findings
In Figure 3, we wanted to understand how the performance of an RFM scaled with the model and
feature size. In order to do so, we generated 1000 random datapoints xi∈Rd→Xand used the
following target function: f(x) = 5 x3
1+ 10x2
2+ 2x3We then trained an RFM and a Laplacian kernel
and calculated their respective MSEs.
What is interesting here is that the test MSE for the RFM is much smaller than the Laplacian kernel’s
MSE when dis between 20 to 200. However, when dis greater than 500, the performances of both
models are very similar even though the RFMs MSE is still a little smaller.
More peculiarly, the MSE curves look highly irregular, as they descend first, then ascent until about
d= 500 , and then descend again. This corresponds roughly to the idea of double descent as seen
in deep neural networks Nakkiran et al. (2019). The fact that the RFM appears to also exhibit this
indicates that the RFM model and a classic deep neural network share similar properties that lead to
interpolation in high-feature regimes.

ABSTRACT
Simulations of animal behavior have the potential to reveal new insights into the
mappings between the brain and natural behaviors that animals evolved to pro-
duce. Artificial neural networks applied in the context of task learning have re-
cently been used as a common model of animal behavior. We reproduce various
visualization and network comparison techniques traditionally applied to neuro-
science to understand artificial neural networks, trained via offline and online re-
inforcement algorithms, in the context of biologically realistic behavior.
1 I NTRODUCTION
Living animals are one of the primary sources of data for the development of artificial neural sys-
tems. In general, animals are able to perform all of their behaviors and actions under the guidance of
a single neural network and its underlying algorithms. One of the end goals for artificial intelligence
systems is to emulate these complex neural networks in a virtual manner, to allow our creations to
act in a way that replicates how a real animal would behave and learn. Embodied control in neuro-
science holds the potential to deepen our understanding of how the real brain works. If a sufficient
model of the brain can be created in conjunction with the behaviors that a biorealistically simulated
agent generates, then we can quickly generate new hypotheses about real world mappings between
the brain and behavior. To achieve this researchers within this field are working to decode all the
parts of animals’ neural networks through inferential and replicatory techniques. One of the leading
method to do so is to build models to learn how to behave like a real animal, mainly through deep
learning models that emulate imitation learning or reinforcement learning. Prior research within
this intersection of neuroscience and machine learning have explored methods to solve tasks given
input data from a sensory channel, such as vision or sound. The particular approach taken in “Deep
Neuroethology of a Virtual Rodent”, along with this replicatory work, focuses on understanding the
underlying mechanisms of “embodied control” Merel et al. (2019), which is how animals utilize a
”combination of their body, sensory input, and behavior” to accomplish tasks, with a particular focus
on motor control. The implications of this study include furthering developments in understanding
the underlying mechanisms of animal behavior within the fields of motor neuroscience and artificial
intelligence.
Since all the underlying mechanisms and algorithms for a live animal’s neural network cannot be
easily observed, it is difficult for observers to understand exactly what is happening. Replication
with deep learning models, however, gives us a chance to pull out all the data from the agent and
see what exactly is happening within the simulated neural network. In addition to this, we are also
able to observe and control nearly every feature of both the agent and environment with the use of
three-dimensional physics simulators. The virtual nature of such models give us significantly more
flexibility compared to experiments with live animals. From this data, inferences can be made to
give us an understanding of what policies go into play during certain actions or behaviors.
Our work builds off the technical framework in Merel et al. (2019), where they use the MuJoCo
physics simulation introduced by Todorov et al. (2012) to simulate a biorealistic rodent model,
created with a skeleton and muscle groups from dissections of a rat. Using an artificial neural
1network as a model for the brain, this rat is trained to accomplish various tasks such as foraging for
food, navigating a maze, and avoiding obstacles - taking sensory information like a real rat would
and using it to actuate muscles in its body in order to accomplish the tasks at hand. In an extension of
Merel’s groundwork we utilized a simplified humanoid model that can perform a walking action as
a human would. In addition to the online reinforcement learning methods utilized in Merel’s work,
we expanded on the algorithms used to train a second simulation based on offline reinforcement
methods. With these trained models in hand, the neural networks can be extracted and explored for
the difference and similarities between the different reinforcement learning frameworks.
The authors apply various visualizations over timescale, kinematics, and neuronal population dy-
namics in order to understand the behavior and neural dynamics of a rodent in the same manner as
a neuroscientist would. Classical methods such as tSNE and PCA have been used van der Maaten
& Hinton (2008), and methods to visualize rotational and oscillatory dynamics of complex models
have been utilized, such as jPCA (Churchland et al. (2012)) and Centered Kernel Alignment Nguyen
et al. (2020). In our work, we seek to reproduce visualization techniques drawn from neuroscience.
We plan to borrow techniques focused on visualizing neural populations to analyze the populations
of neurons within artificial neural networks akin to real brains. Overall, the goal in this work is to
evaluate the differences and similarities between models trained via online reinforcement learning
and offline reinforcement learning. This replication, it will give us further insight into the nuances
between the two.
2 M ETHODOLOGY
The models used for this evaluation are based on the framework for the Walker2D agent from the
Mujoco Gym environment. As per the Gym documentation, the walker builds upon the prior hopper
environment, whose task is to jump on one leg, by adding an additional leg to allow for walking
movements. The model is composed of a torso, two upper leg segments, two lower leg segments,
and two feet, as shown in Figure 1.
The task used for evaluation was the walking task, which involves the agent learning how to apply
torque on the joints to make itself walk forward without its position moving out of the specified
bounds of the environment or its joint angles being outside a specified range. The training process
involves teaching the agent how to act through both online and offline reinforcement learning where
the walker is rewarded and penalized according to its reward function. The reward is calculated
through three components: the healthy reward, the forward reward, and the control cost. The healthy
reward is a fixed value awarded to the agent every timestep if it is upright and moving faster than a
specified speed. The forward reward is measured by the forward reward weight times the difference
between the x coordinate before the action and the x coordinate after the action, divided by the
time between actions. The control cost is a penalty if the agent makes an action that deviates too
much from the previous one. The total reward is calculated by adding the healthy reward bonus and
forward reward then penalizing the agent for the control cost by subtracting it.
Torque can be applied to any combination of the upper leg, lower leg, or foot for the walker’s
legs. From these models, we can extract data–such as joint angles, joint velocities, and positional
data–from the available observation space for later comparison between the model itself or the two
differently trained models.
The two algorithms used to train an individual agent are online reinforcement learning and offline
reinforcement learning for the purpose of exploring the representational differences within the re-
spective neural networks. The main difference between online and offline methods involves what
data is made available to the agent at any given time step and how it learns from it through the
training.
The first walker agent will be trained through online reinforcement learning, where the agent will be
learning how to perform its task, walking, through interactions with its environment. Specifically,
the Soft-Actor Critic reinforcement learning algorithm guides the agent’s decisions and interactions
with the environment. This is an off-policy algorithm that optimizes both a Q-function and stochastic
policy function at each timestep by using the policy gradient algorithm, along with utilizing entropy
regularization to promote the exploration of a broader range of actions. The ”critic” network of the
Soft-Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm takes in the state and action and outputs the Q-value from the Q-

function. The “actor” network learns to optimize the policy function by taking the state as the input
and outputting the probability distribution over the action space. This actor-network is supervised by
the critic network to minimize the mean squared error between the predicted and actual Q-values.
Online reinforcement methods allow for adaptability in the agent’s actions due to it adjusting its
policies accordingly given the environment state in real-time. However, this means that the agent
will essentially be learning through trial and error, so it will be making suboptimal actions in the
training process.
The second walker model will be trained through offline reinforcement learning methods, meaning
that the entire dataset of the collected observations in Table 1, along with the action and reward
states, will be fed to the agent to train upon. This reinforcement learning method involves training
the agent on pre-collected data, in this case, data from the agent trained via online reinforcement
learning. Since all the data is available to the agent upfront, no interactions with the environment
are needed. Once the “expert” demonstration is trained, a second agent can be trained via behavior
cloning by learning how to imitate the actions of the online reinforcement learning Walker given the
expert data. Behavior cloning is a supervised learning method where the predicted actions are com-
pared against the expert demonstration and, eventually, learns a policy through maximum likelihood
estimation.
One limitation of offline reinforcement learning is that it does not generalize well to situations not
found within the training dataset. Unlike online reinforcement learning, agents trained via offline
methods do not interact with the environment in the training process, so it will only be trained on
situations within the expert demonstration’s training dataset. This can result in poor performance in
scenarios not present in the training set and non-robust policies. To address this challenge, the noise
3was added to the training dataset for the behavioral cloning model. From this, eight variations of the
same model were generated to explore the effect noise had on how well the offline model could learn
and generalize. Models for the following amount of noise were created and used for comparison:
0%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 80%, and 160%. The addition of noise is especially beneficial for offline
models since it makes the data more diverse and generates additional situations, which in turn helps
the trained policy generalize to new data and unexpected situations.
On paper, online reinforcement learning boasts adaptability to environmental conditions. In contrast,
offline reinforcement is more efficient in learning tasks since it does not require interactions with
the environment and does not face the exploration issues that online reinforcement learning methods
typically do. The capabilities of the two algorithms will be tested and analyzed for differences in
performance and representational similarity.
After training the model, we can now compare the similarity between the neural activities of the
two differently trained agents. Central Kernel Alignment is the primary method used to compare
the representational similarity of the neural networks of the offline and online agents. The CKA
similarity metric was calculated using the methodology described in by Simon Kornblith (2019).
CKA(XXT, YYT) =∥XYT∥F
∥XXT∥F∥Y YT∥F
In the CKA equation formulated by Simon Kornblith (2019), ∥∗∥ Fis the Frobenius norm. CKA
compares the representational similarity of features between neural networks to compute a similarity
metric. It does so by calculating the similarity between the matrix of pairwise similarities for each set
of features and then finding the normalized Frobenius inner product between the pairwise similarity
of the central subspaces of the feature sets after centering them. The result is a value between 0 and 1,
with 0 signifying no similarity and 1 meaning the features are exactly the same. The representational
similarity of each pairwise combination of activation layers within the SAC and behavioral cloning
model can be compared between the two networks and within each individual network.
In order to compare the walking behavior of the two agents, we use t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor
Embedding (t-SNE) as a dimensionality reduction method for mapping the agent’s 3D movements
through time (consisting of height positions of every body part for each timestep) into 2D space.
The mapping produces distinct clusters/groupings, which shows how the agent’s gait changes as it
moves through time.
The process of mapping the height positions of various body parts of the agent, with respect to the
ground, into 2D space involves the calculation of similarities of each input data point (a series of
height positions at each timestep) to every other input point in the collected agent kinematics. t-SNE
then attempts to learn a 2-dimensional map that reflects these similarities as well as possible. This
mapping is determined by minimizing the KL divergence of the distribution of similarities in the
original input space with the distribution of similarities between mapped points in the output 2D
space (Maaten Hintonet al.).
The clusters inherent to a t-SNE plot are better pronounced by applying a watershed to the plot.
A watershed clustering algorithm applied to this mapping, which uses KDE to highlight central
”hotspot” regions within the t-SNE, is expected to identify key groupings between different gaits
adopted in the agent’s movement.
Final analysis of the kinematics of the walker agents was conducted using Power Spectral Density
(PSD). PSD analyzes the frequency of time series data, which can be applied to the kinematic data
generated by the Walker agents performing the walking task. In this case, the frequency of the
agent’s movements when walking was analyzed by PSD to detect oscillations within the frequency
of the movement cycle. After the kinematic data is collected from each agent, the movement signal
is sampled and then transformed with a Fourier transformation, which converts the signal from the
time representation to a frequency representation. Once the data is in this form, the power per unit
frequency, or PSD, can be calculated from the signal and plotted.

Figure 2: CKA Similarity Between Online and Offline RL Networks
3 R ESULTS /ANALYSIS
The results of the CKA similarity analysis are displayed in Figure 2. Plots A and B demonstrate that
the activation from the online reinforcement learning and behavior cloning models are not represen-
tationally similar when comparing them to layers within their respective neural networks. If the two
networks were similar, each unique combination of layers should have the same shade in both self-
comparison graphs. Most notably, the log std linear layer and the linear2 layer display high similarity
within the behavior cloning network; however, comparing them in the online reinforcement learning
network shows very little similarity. Furthermore, plots C and D further showcase the fact that there
is very little similarity between the reinforcement learning and behavior cloning models. The CKA
analysis between the reinforcement learning and behavior cloning networks yields values smaller
than 0.1 for all combinations of activations. This suggests that the two representations are highly
dissimilar, meaning the representations and task learning significantly differ between the two agents.
However, when comparing the online reinforcement learning model to the behavior cloning model
with noise, it was found that they displayed higher similarity than the model without any addition
of noise. This suggests that the policy learning by the behavioral cloning model with noise is more
robust and more closely reflects the representations of the online reinforcement learning model from
which it was trained. Contrary to what we hypothesized, it turns out that a behavior-cloning-trained
agent has very different representations concerning the walking task.
Tracking the points plotted on the t-SNE plot as the agent moves about its environment, we notice
the emergence of a cyclical pattern of movement within the t-SNE through time. Such a cyclical
movement around the plot indicates the clear presence of a structured gait cycle, in which the agent
repeats its stance in a cyclical fashion as it takes two steps in a straight line through its environment.
5Figure 3: t-SNE plots of Gait Cycles for SAC and BC agents
In the generated t-SNE plots shown above, to which a watershed clustering has been applied (Figure
3) we see the presence of a repetitive cycle for both our SAC agent and our BC agent trained with
noise, that navigates through each identified cluster before returning to its starting cluster. From this
pattern, we see that as the agents move about their environments, their patterns of walking become
more structured and monotonous, resulting in clear cyclical patterns appearing in the t-SNE plot.
Furthermore, by comparing the two plots, we can also see that there is less variance in the gait cycle
of the BC agent (the cyclical movement within the t-SNE follows a more direct path), which is what
we identify as a more consistent stride in the agent’s walking movement.
Both the online and offline reinforcement learning models generate actions guided by policies that
control behavior. It is important to ensure that the power spectral densities of the kinematics are
preserved to ensure the learned behaviors are the same. If the PSD is not preserved between the two
agents, the model may not be able to capture crucial aspects of the behavior that we want to compare.
In this particular case, we further analyzed if the walking behavior is what we expect from a walking
motion and is not a different action. To verify this, the behavior cloning model should be able
to replicate the frequency distribution of the agent’s movements. From the power spectral density
analysis, it can be concluded that the harmonics present in the original online reinforcement learning
model are preserved and also displayed in both the behavior cloning models with and without noise.
All three models being compared, BC with noise, BC with no noise, and RL, all display highly
similar movement cycles as shown by Figure 4. From the PSD analysis, we can conclude that the
harmonics of the movement is preserved between online and offline reinforcement learning models.
6Figure 4: Power Spectral Density of Kinematics
4 C ONCLUSION
In conclusion, the online and offline reinforcement learning models appear to be display highly
dissimilar representations, as suggested by the CKA analysis. This analysis revealed close to no
correlation between the representations of each model, suggesting they learned different policies for
the same task. Despite being trained on the data generated from the online reinforcement learning
model, the offline model ended up formulating significantly different representations and policies.
Further differences in the behavior of the two agents are exemplified through the analysis of the
t-SNE plot for each agent, from which it was found that the stride of the BC agent was more strict,
compared to that of the SAC agent.
This analysis provides insights of the underlying nuances within offline and online reinforcement
learning algorithms. By evaluating the similarity of the representations between the two networks
and the agents’ behavioral patterns, we gained insights of the strengths and weaknesses of the dif-
ferent approaches. Overall, the findings of this study contributes to the research in the intersecting
field of neuroscience and deep learning and provides footwork for further efforts of the relationship
between these two variants of reinforcement learning.

I. ABSTRACT
Utilizing correlative biomarkers from inexpensive blood tests as ground truths could decrease the cost of obtaining
training data for deep learning dramatically. This work aims to analyze the success of utilizing BNPP levels as a
heuristic for pulmonary edema for training data by testing these chest radiograph models on radiologist confirmed
pulmonary edema radiographs from a public dataset. It also explores the use of anatomical segmentation for images
to help focus the model on biologically important aspects of the image.
II. INTRODUCTION
Medical imaging requires highly specialized analysis by imaging professionals. This process is costly and time
consuming. In recent years, there has been a push to use machine learning and a form of Artificial Intelligence called
Deep Learning to analyze medical images without the need of specialized persons involvement. These models have
gained popularity as their effectiveness are proven time and time again. However, the training process for these models
requires tens of thousands of medical images and their lab diagnoses.
In an effort to reduce the burden on training the models, this paper utilizes biomarkers from blood streams that
are representative of pulmonary edema, instead of actual pulmonary edema diagnoses. This work expands on past
work performed by AiDA Lab ([2]), which found success in predicting biomarker levels from blood tests using chest
radiographs. These blood tests are far cheaper and faster. Therefore, this paper presents models trained on these
biomarkers, compares different training techniques using conventional statistics, and implements saliency techniques.
Furthermore, this paper explores the success of this model on publicly available datasets. Additionally, this paper
utilizes a lung segmentation model to create new lung-and-heart only images to be used for a new training model.
The goal of this new model is to compare the effectiveness of model prediction on using focusing attention on key
anatomical elements we are predicting diagnoses for.
III. METHODS
A. UCSD Data
Utilizing the dataset provided by AiDA Lab at UCSD Health ([2]), there was a total of 16,000 chest radiograph
images, each with a correspond BNPP value. The mean and standard deviation of BNPP values across the set
was 4919 ±11039 pg/mL. This total set was randomly split into train and validation sets with an 80%, 20% split,
respectively. Using a threshold of 400 pg/mL, the BNPP values are classified into positive and negative classes as a
heuristic for pulmonary edema. The set contained 64.6% positive labels. These images were downsampled to a size
of 224 by 224.3
B. MIMIC-CXR Data
MIT’s MIMIC-CXR study provides their data publicly ([3]). 22,000 chest radiograph images were sampled from
their set. The set contained 48.7% positive labels. These images were downsampled to a size of 224 by 224.
C. Image Segmentation
All images went through a U-Net based anatomical segmentation model, kindly provided by AiDA Lab ([2]). The
segmentation model provides a heart, left lung, and right lung segmentation. The lungs were combined into a singular
image and then the lungs and the hearts were added as separate channels to create segmentation datasets.
D. Model Training
All Neural Networks used were built with a ResNet 152v2 pre-trained on ImageNet ([1]). Each model was trained
using at max 30 epochs (Early Stopping based on change in validation AUROC), a static learning rate of 1e-5, a
weight decay of 0.9, and a batch size of 32. The loss function utilized is weighted cross balanced entropy.
All layers of the models were unfrozen for training. Models were analyzed using conventional statistics including
Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve (AUROC), Area Under the Precision Recall Curve (PRC), and Accuracy.
E. Model Evaluation
After training, each model was tested on the held back MIMIC data. The same conventional statistics were applied
to the test sets. The best performing model was then further analyzed using XRAI, a saliency technique ([4]).
Each model was evaluated based on Area Under ROC (AUROC) and a Precision-Recall Score (PRC).
IV. RESULTS
In total, four models were trained, two UCSD training data based (one full image, one segmentation) and two
MIMIC training data based (one full image, one segmentation). All four models were evaluated on the same withheld
MIMIC test set.
For each style of images (full or segmented), MIMIC trained models outperformed their respective UCSD biomarker
trained models by a considerable amount, allowing for the rejection of Hypothesis 1 (VII, 1, 2). Currently, models
trained on radiologist ground truths outperform models trained on heuristic biomarkers for the prediction of pulmonary
edema presence.
The model trained on MIMIC segmented images performed the best overall. However, between the UCSD trained
models, the segmented images did not improve performance more than the full images.
The best performing model (MIMIC based segmentation) was further analyzed using XRAI ([4], 3).4
V. DISCUSSION
From these results, it appears that biomarkers as a heuristic are not a quality substitute for radiologist confirmed
labels for the identification of pulmonary edema. The UCSD biomarker trained models consistently under-performed
compared to their MIMIC radiologist confirmed data models. The differences in each performance statistic are vast,
MIMIC based models were at least 10% better.
There are a few explanations for these results. First, biomarkers are a good correlative feature for pulmonary edema
identification, but with enough error to affect model performance significantly. In this case, radioligist confirmed
ground truths are to be preferred. Second, models trained on biomarkers need additional hyperoptimization to
perform at the level of models trained on radiologist confirmed ground truths. This experiment trained all models
using the same techniques for fairness; however, this could have the exact opposite effect by not giving enough
accommodation to a model that is performing a harder task. Third, models trained on the MIMIC set were also
tested on the MIMIC set, whereas UCSD biomarker models were tested on a different set (MIMIC). It is possible that
there is a homogeneity across MIMIC set and a different homogeneity across UCSD set due to the actual radiographic
images themselves. MIMIC trained models would have the advantage of learning those features across the dataset,
while UCSD trained models would be punished for learning the features inherent to the UCSD set. Overall, In this
experiment, Hypothesis 1 can be rejected.
Alternatively, segmented images had a nonzero improvement in MIMIC based models, while it had a negative
effect on UCSD biomarker based models. Interestingly, MIMIC trained models performed better than UCSD trained
models. It could be possible that segmentation helped improve the models that better represented the the feature
space of pulmonary edema by targeting focus to the anatomical structures that mattered. On the same note, the
UCSD models did not represent the pulmonary edema feature space appropriately and thus segmentation may have
led it further astray. Of course, the improvement in MIMIC based models and the worsening of UCSD models due to
segmentation was minimal and could thus be completely random.
For both experiments, future work is necessary. Better training procedures for biomarker based models would most
likely improve results. Additionally, the results for segmentation are unclear. Further experimentation is necessary
to see if improvement was an artifact of randomness or a significant result.

Abstract
Background
This project investigates the potential of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to iden-
tify cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE) from chest radiographs and NT-proBNP biomarker
measurements. Building upon the methods used by Huynh in “Deep Learning Radiographic
Assessment of Pulmonary Edema,” our project aimed to expand upon his findings by modifying
CNN architectures to intake additional parameters [1]. Specifically, we evaluated the impact
of including (1) clinical data and (2) heart and lung image segmentation on CNN model per-
formance: we hypothesized that incorporating these features would improve the ability of the
CNN classifier to identify CPE.
Methods
Chest radiographs and clinical data obtained from 16,619 UC San Diego Health patients
were randomly split into train, validation, and test sets at a ratio of 80%/10%/10%. We trained
four modified ResNet152 CNN architectures with differing inputs: (A) Original Radiographs
only, (B) Original Radiographs + Clinical Data, (C) Original Radiographs + Heart & Lung
Segmentations, and (D) Original Radiographs + Heart & Lung Segmentations + Clinical Data.
Early stopping was implemented to save the models with the minimum loss on the validation
set (n = 1,662). The four model’s accuracy and AUC on the test set (n = 1,662) were used to
compare model performance.
Results
Model (B) had the highest accuracy (0.787) and AUC (0.869). Model (D) performed
marginally worse than Model (B), with accuracy and AUC of 0.783 and 0.866, respectively.
Models (A) and (B) performed considerably worse than both Models (B) and (D).
Conclusions
This project emphasizes the need to consider confounding factors, clinical data, and image
segmentation when training CNN models for medical imaging classification tasks. While an
1increase in CNN model performance was observed from adding clinical data, a performance
increase was not observed in the models that included heart and lung segmentations. Further
research is needed to determine the optimal use of image segmentations in CNN models.
1 Introduction
Pulmonary edema is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition with increased extravascular
lung water [2]. The condition is most commonly caused by two major conditions: cardiogenic and
noncardiogenic. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE) typically results from acute decompensated
heart failure due to increased filling pressures in the heart’s left chambers, causing pressure backflow
to the lung vasculature [3]. Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is caused by increased permeability
of the lung capillaries resulting from injury, infection, or trauma.
NT-proBNP is a natriuretic hormone released primarily from the heart in response to increased
chamber size due to increased filling pressures. Elevated levels of NT-proBNP can be used to
determine if findings of pulmonary edema from chest radiographs are due to cardiogenic versus
noncardiogenic causes [4].
However, NT-proBNP levels are influenced by confounding factors such as renal failure, age, sex,
and BMI [5]. First, patients in renal failure tend to have higher concentrations of NT-proBNP due to
increased intravascular volume [6]. As such, we incorporated laboratory measurements of Creatinine,
which is the most widely used biomarker for measuring kidney function [7]. Second, patients with
obesity tend to have lower concentrations of NT-proBNP compared to non-obese patients. However,
it is not known whether this disparity is due to obesity or other confounding variables including age,
sex, and heart failure severity [5]. For this project, we included BMI measurements for each patient
so the CNN model could account for this confounding variable.
The typical chest radiograph findings of pulmonary edema range from mild to severe, including
redistribution of pulmonary blood vessels, cardiomegaly, Kerley B-lines, peribronchial cuffing, con-
solidations, air bronchograms, and pleural effusions. These are the primary identifiers for examining
chest radiographs to diagnose CPE.
CNNs have been effective in classifying diseases from medical images. However, the consistency
and accuracy of manually labeled medical image datasets is an area of concern. In addition, highly
accurate and generalizable CNNs for diagnosing diseases from medical images have a strong appli-
cation, particularly in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC) where there may not be enough
radiologists. To address these points, Huynh proposed the method of training CNNs to predict
NT-proBNP concentrations; this biomarker provides a continuous and objective measure used for
diagnosing CPE.
2 Literature Review and Prior Work
Huynh’s study included 26,667 radiographs with a corresponding NT-proBNP value and 1,423 ra-
diographs with a BNP value. These BNP values are blood serum biomarkers indicative of acute
heart failure and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The datasets were partitioned into 80% train,
210% validation, and 10% test sets, and the distribution of NT-proBNP and BNP values remained
relatively constant across the sets. Based on scientific literature, the threshold for diagnosing car-
diogenic pulmonary edema is NT-proBNP 400 pg/mL [4]. The ResNet152v2 model trained on a
two stage training process of transfer learning. The first stage was used to infer NT-proBNP values,
while the second layer used ResNet152v2 to infer BNP values. This model architecture was trained,
and performance was measured across different image resolutions. The correlation between the true
and predicted values peaked as smaller image sizes for both BNP and NT-proBNP. However, the
AUC scores increased to 1024x1024, indicating greater CNN performance. Additionally, the study
found that BNP predictions had stronger correlations to the measured BNP values than NT-proBNP
predictions to the measured NT-proBNP values.
The scientific paper ”Lung Field Segmentation in Chest Radiographs: a Historical Review, Cur-
rent Status, and Expectations from Deep Learning” by Sanjeev Sofat et al. explored a modified
U-Net architecture for biomedical image segmentation. The model was designed to effectively seg-
ment the lung field, clavicles, and heart using 18 convolutional layers. Although this model did not
perform as well as an existing InvertedNet architecture, the researchers pointed out the shift from
feature engineering to improving architecture engineering.
One of the primary challenges the researchers face is the limited availability of annotated medical
data for training. To address this issue, they have looked to transfer learning and are also attempting
to crowdsource large medical datasets with the assistance of radiologists. Despite the challenges,
the researchers remain optimistic about the potential of deep learning techniques in medical image
segmentation and hope to improve the accuracy and efficiency of these models.
In the paper Comparing different deep learning architectures for classification of chest radiographs
by Keno Bressem et. al., the researchers used 15 CNNs of five architectures: ResNet, DenseNet,
VGG, SqueezeNet, Inception v4, and AlexNet. This project was conducted in a similar domain as
our project, although the scope was broadened to include other diseases like cardiomegaly, atelec-
tasis, and pleural effusion. They hypothesized that deeper CNNs do not necessarily have better
performance than shallower networks. They noted that with increased complexity of a CNN, the
higher the amount of resources required to train a model. To account for larger images, we can
reduce batch sizes to avoid memory errors. They concluded that AlexNet, ResNet34, and VGG16,
which are shallower CNNs, gave an accurate classification of radiographs. These results are insight-
ful since it shows that with networks with fewer layers, we may have more hyperparameter tuning
and a faster training process, while being able to efficiently handle larger images.
3 Data Description
We constructed a dataset of 16,619 records from UCSD Health patients. The NT-proBNP column
represents the NT-proBNP value, a continuously valued biomarker measured from blood serum
samples. The NT-proBNP values are bottom and top coded as their minimum possible value is
0 pg/mL, and the maximum is 70,000 pg/mL. As shown in Figure 1, there is a strong right skew
for NT-proBNP values. Due to this, we followed Huynh’s study and performed a log (base 10)
transformation to create the log10 NTproBNP column. The histogram for log10 NT-proBNP in
3Figure 1 shows that the distribution is approximately normal due to the log transformation. Using
the threshold for pulmonary edema consistent with academic literature, we classified patients with an
NT-proBNP value of at least 400 pg/mL as positive for cardiogenic pulmonary edema and patients
under the threshold as normal cases. Similarly, on the logarithmic scale, any records with a log10
NT-proBNP value of at least 2.602 are considered positive for cardiogenic pulmonary edema. These
binary cases were encoded in the ‘cardiogenic edema’ column. Around 64.7% of the records in our
dataset had cardiogenic pulmonary edema based on this threshold.
The ‘bmi’ column contains the patient’s body mass index ( kg/m2), derived from a patient’s
mass and height. The ‘creatinine’ column contains a continuous Creatinine concentration ( mg/dL )
measured from blood serum samples. The normal range for adult males is 0.7 to 1.3 mg/dL and
0.6 to 1.1 mg/dL for adult females [8]. The ‘pneumonia’ and ‘acute heart failure’ columns indicate
the presence or absence of these physician clinical findings. In the dataset, 12.0% of patients have
pneumonia, and 17.2% have acute heart failure. The dataset initially provided by the UCSD Artificial
Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDA) Lab had 18,900 deidentified records.
4 Methods
4.1 Clinical Data
To ensure high-quality data for our project, we excluded patients with missing values for columns
containing clinical data, specifically Creatinine, BMI, Acute Heart Failure, and Pneumonia. This
exclusion was performed on the initial dataset of 18,900 patient records, resulting in 2,281 patients
being removed from the final dataset used for model training, validation, and testing. The remaining
dataset contained 16,619 patients. The potential mechanisms of missingness were not evaluated for
the excluded patients.
4.2 Lung & Heart Image Segmentation
The UC San Diego AIDA laboratory provided a pre-trained U-Net CNN, which we used to create
predicted binary masks of the right and left lungs, heart, right and left clavicle, and spinal column
for each patient’s chest radiograph. These masks were generated by applying the pre-trained model
to the full dataset of patient chest radiographs. We then used the binary masks to create a new
image of only the heart and another with only the lungs (Figure 2).
4.3 ResNet152 Architectures
We used the default PyTorch ResNet152 model, with only one (regression) output class instead of ten
(classification), to train four models. Model A took only the original radiographs as inputs. Model
B incorporated the clinical data by modifying the forward method of the model to concatenate the
clinical data with the output from the convolutional layers. Model C took in the original radiographs,
lung segmentations, and heart segmentations (three image channels) as inputs, passing each through
the model’s convolutional layers. Model D took in the original radiographs, lung segmentations, and

heart segmentations (three image channels), and the clinical data as inputs. The forward method
of the model was modified to concatenate the clinical data with the output from the convolutional
layers (Figure 3).
4.4 Model Training/Validation
All four models were trained on the training set with a batch size of 12 for 20 epochs using the
NAdam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 [hyperparameters: betas=(0.9, 0.999), eps=1e-08,
weight decay=0], and the mean absolute error (MAE) loss function. The MAE on the validation
set was computed after each epoch, and early stopping was implemented such that the model with
the minimum MAE on the validation set was saved. The overall purpose of the validation set was
to optimize the model’s parameters during training. (Figure 7)
4.5 Model Testing
After 20 epochs, the MAE on the unseen test set was computed for the four models with the
minimum MAE on the validation set. We also saved each patient’s predicted log10(NT-proBNP)
values in the test set. We plotted these predictions against the laboratory-measured values for
log10(NT-proBNP) and calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient (r). We used the threshold
for cardiogenic pulmonary edema diagnosis (log10(400 pg/mL) = 2.602) to binarize each model’s
predicted values of log10(NT-proBNP) and calculated accuracy and AUC using the test set. We
created confusion matrices and AUC-ROC curves for all four models and used these metrics to

5 Results
Table 1 includes all four ResNet152 model performances by input data, including their respective
Train L1-Loss, Test L1-Loss, Accuracy, AUC, and Pearson R scores. This table highlights that
Model (B) performed the best with an accuracy of 0.787 and AUC of 0.869.
Figure 4 displays the ROC curves of each ResNet152 model with different model inputs. Model
(B) achieved the highest AUC score of 0.869 compared to Model A (AUC: 0.824), Model C (AUC:
0.828) and Model D (AUC: 0.866). Figure 5 presents the four outcomes to visualize the performance
rates for each model. As previously mentioned, the matrices showcase that Model (B) outperformed
all other models.
The performance of the models can also be seen in the Pearson correlation scatterplots, as shown
in Figure 6. The red lines with the equation y=x represent a perfect regression model in which the
predicted values perfectly align with the observed values. The scatterplots show that Models (B)
and (D) follow the red line most closely. The correlation coefficients for these two models are similar
(r = 0.739 and r = 0.738, respectively), thus showing that they outperform the models that do not
include Clinical Data.

6 Discussion
From the above results, it was apparent that a more complex and preprocessed input including
segmentations did not appear to improve the ability of the classifier to identify cases of pulmonary
edema. We hypothesized that image segmentation of X-rays would help focus the neural network
on the lungs and heart regions, where cardiogenic pulmonary edema is most identifiable from ra-
diographs. We proposed that by reducing noise in the input, the classifier could better distinguish
cardiogenic pulmonary edema and normal cases. However, heart and lung segmentation did not
improve performance, which is likely because the neural network was able to learn the necessary
features from the original X-rays. Providing segmented images is not necessarily adding information
to the ResNet152 model, but is instead cropping information out when it is passed to the network.
Another reason we believe segmentation was not as beneficial as we had hypothesized is due to
the dataset size. By training on around 13,000 images, the neural network will most likely have
sufficient data to distinguish normal and edema cases and determine that these differences lie in the
heart and lung regions. If there were a smaller set of training images. In that case, segmentation
might yield a better classifier due to the more focused input provided and the possible lack of the
neural network’s ability to have enough data to focus on the heart and lungs.
Our results reinforce our hypothesis that the addition of confounding factors as features improve
the performance of a classifier. This suggests that when creating a classifier, it is crucial to under-
stand the features that truly correlate with the target feature. In this case, the clinical labels have
shown that they have a high impact on the presence of CPE.

ABSTRACT
This project focuses on training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for a supervised classification
task, specifically for predicting the presence of pulmonary edema and pleural effusion in chest
radiographs. The project is a series of experiments to formulate a pipeline based on deep learning best
practices, to achieve the best performing model for this multi-label classification task. The first
experiment involved determining the appropriate application of transfer learning to chest radiograph
image data. It was determined that the models should be trained through a serial unfreezing of the top
layers in the ResNet152 architecture, at intervals of unfreezing one block of layers every 10 epochs with
early stopping. The second experiment involved testing different formulations of the problem statement to
achieve the best performing model. Separated binary label classifiers, a multi-label classifier and a
multi-class classifier were all trained and evaluated using label prediction accuracy and the AUC (Area
Under the Curve) of the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve which is a measure of the
model’s discriminability. The multi-class classifier had the best overall performance, achieving an
accuracy of 80% in the prediction of pulmonary edema and 83% in the prediction of pleural effusion, with
the corresponding ROC AUC scores for both labels being 0.88 and 0.90 respectively.
INTRODUCTION
Radiographs are an imperative source of information for physicians in determining certain ailments their
patients may have. With the huge advancements made in the field of deep learning, images can be
processed in novel ways to produce insights efficiently, as opposed to time-intensive manual approaches
even by professionals in that particular domain. This project deals with the application of convolutionalneural networks (CNNs), which are deep-learning architectures composed of a combination of
convolutional layers (which consist of a set of filters to activate features of the input images), pooling
layers (to reduce the dimensions within the network) and fully connected linear layers to ultimately
produce the model’s prediction. CNNs are most commonly used in image classification, a supervised
machine-learning approach where the model is fed a fully labeled training dataset and predetermined
classification categories, and it is able to learn features from the given data to accurately predict the class
of unseen and unlabeled test data.
In the case of chest radiograph classification, there are significant time costs associated with the effort that
radiologists need to apply to manually annotate radiographs for supervised training. Various high
performance NLP tools like CheXpert and NegBio have been developed to automate this process. These
algorithms can detect and infer medical terms directly from electronic health records and reports,
associated with the radiographs. As a result, the necessary training data can be collated from the patient
records without any additional manual effort. Expanding on the NLP tool, the CheXpert
2
initiative at
Stanford significantly guided the approaches used in this project. The CheXpert task aimed to develop
and evaluate deep learning algorithms for chest X-ray interpretation. To achieve this, a large-scale dataset
of chest X-rays, along with associated radiology reports, was created and annotated. A Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) was trained on this dataset to classify the presence of 14 different thoracic
diseases. The focus of this task was on leveraging the ability of deep learning algorithms to learn complex
patterns in medical imaging data and apply them to make accurate predictions. The work behind training
the CheXpert deep learning model has contributed to advancing the field of medical imaging and the
development of more accurate and efficient algorithms for interpreting chest X-rays.
In this project, the MIMIC-CXR database of chest radiographs and patient reports will be used to train a
CNN classifier, using transfer learning techniques. The MIMIC-CXR database
3,4
consists of 377,000
radiographs, stored in a DICOM format with resolutions of up to 4K. As a result, the size of this databaseis 4 TB, and it is currently hosted in a Google Cloud bucket, where credentialed users can access the data.
For this project, the classifier will predict two labels, associated with Pulmonary Edema and Pleural
Effusion. In its current state, the database metadata contains information associated with 14 labels,
automatically produced by running both the CheXpert and NegBio algorithms on the patient reports.
Considering the performance of the model and computational resources available, the inputs to the
classifier will be downsampled to standard 512*512 images, and a subset of 34,000 images which have
labels associated with both conditions will be used for the training process.
OBJECTIVES
The first objective is to determine the balance point for unfreezing layers in the ResNet152 architecture
during the model training phase, between faster convergence and overfitting. This will allow the
development of a consistent training process with constrained hyperparameters to achieve a good model
performance while allowing a comparison across models. The second objective is to train and compare
the performances of a set of single binary label classifiers, a multi-label classifier and multi-class
classifier, on the metrics of label prediction accuracy, ROC AUC score and overall training time. This will
provide a basis for making a conclusion on how best to approach the task of multi-label classification for
chest radiograph image data.
DATA
The MIMIC-CXR database is a collection of chest radiographs (CXRs) that has been curated from the
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database, which contains clinical information from
over 60,000 critical care patients. The CXRs in the MIMIC-CXR database were acquired from various
intensive care units (ICUs) using different radiographic equipment and techniques, resulting in a diverse
range of imaging quality and patient positioning. The database contains over 377,000 de-identified CXRs,
making it one of the largest publicly available datasets of chest radiographs.The MIMIC-CXR database has been extensively annotated by expert radiologists to provide a rich set of
labels and metadata. These annotations include radiographic findings, such as the presence or absence of
lung opacities, pleural effusions, and cardiomegaly, as well as clinical data, such as patient demographics,
hospital admission and discharge dates, and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. The
database also includes time-series data, allowing for the tracking of changes in radiographic features over
time.
The labels used in this investigation correspond to Pulmonary Edema and Pleural Effusion. Pulmonary
edema and pleural effusion are both medical conditions that can affect the lungs and breathing. Pulmonary
edema is a condition in which excess fluid accumulates in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe. The
excess fluid can be caused by several factors, such as heart failure, kidney failure, lung infections, or
exposure to high altitudes. Pleural effusion is a condition in which excess fluid accumulates in the pleural
space, which is the space between the two layers of tissue that surround the lungs. This can also make it
difficult to breathe, as the excess fluid can put pressure on the lungs. While both conditions deal with the
buildup of fluid, they present in different areas of a chest radiograph. Therefore, it would be worthwhile
to train a CNN model to predict these labels simultaneously.
METHODS
I.
EXPERIMENT I: DETERMINING A MODEL TRAINING PIPELINE
Transfer learning is a machine learning technique that involves using a pre-trained neural network
to solve a new task. Instead of training a neural network from scratch, transfer learning involves
taking an existing neural network that has already been trained on a large dataset and adapting it
for a new task. The pre-trained neural network is typically a deep neural network that has learned
to recognize complex features in images. To adapt the pre-trained network for a new task, the
final layers of the network are typically replaced with new layers that are specific to the new task.
These new layers are then trained on a smaller dataset that is specific to the new task. Thisapproach allows for the transfer of knowledge from the pre-trained network, which has learned to
recognize general features, to the new task, which may require more specialized features. The
following image shows how transfer learning is used for feature extraction:
Figure 1:
General use of CNN architectures in Transfer
Learning

The decision of when to unfreeze layers in a pre-trained neural network depends on several
factors, such as the size and similarity of the new dataset to the original dataset, the complexity of
the new task, and the performance of the model on the new task. In general, if the new dataset is
small and similar to the original dataset, it may be beneficial to keep most or all of the layers in
the pre-trained network frozen and only train the new layers that are specific to the new task. This
approach helps to prevent overfitting on the small dataset and makes use of the pre-trained
network's ability to recognize general features.
On the other hand, if the new dataset is large and dissimilar to the original dataset, it may be
beneficial to unfreeze some of the layers in the pre-trained network and fine-tune them on the
new task. In this instance, the ImageNet dataset consists of over 14 million images, which have
been annotated with object labels and bounding boxes. The chest radiograph image data used in
this project is dissimilar enough to the ImageNet dataset to warrant an investigation into whether
layers with pre-trained weights should be unfrozen in the training process.
This experiment was conducted partly during Quarter 1, and extended for its specific application
for this quarter’s project. During Quarter 1, I trained a CNN regression model on similar chest
radiograph image data with continuous BNPP serum biomarker labels from a dataset compiled at
UCSD Health
6
. Initially, I left all 566 layers in
the ResNet152 architecture frozen but quickly
realized that due to the huge imbalance in number of trainable to untrainable parameters, the
model simply wasn't learning. Therefore, I decided to explore unfreezing certain layers iteratively
in the following schedule, and observed the following:

Table 1:
Iterative unfreezing of convolution layer
blocks
The major observation from this experiment was that unfreezing further layers in the architecture
allows the model to better fit to the new dataset, up until a certain point where it would begin to
overfit as seen when Convolution 4 was also unfrozen for learning. Therefore, applying this
understanding on where the ResNet152 architecture would begin to overfit, the following model
training and serial layer unfreezing pipeline was developed as shown in Figure 2:Figure 2:
General Model Training Pipeline - Both the
top and bottom layers of the architecture
are augmented for the correct input image format and output label format, depending on the task.
The Model Training Pipeline shown in the figure was adapted from the Quarter 1 experiment with
a few changes. Since the task at hand for this project is a classification task with binary labels as
opposed to regression with a continuous target, the ResNet152 architecture tended to fit more
quickly to the training data, despite the larger dataset being used for this project. Therefore, each
setting of the model was trained for a shorter duration of 10 epochs with early stopping, and only
one block of layers were unfrozen between settings as opposed to multiple blocks of layers as
shown in Table 2. The training baseline of 10 epochs was determined after observing when early
stopping took effect on a binary classifier for pulmonary edema using the MIMIC-CXR dataset
with all frozen layers. Since this setting instantiates the least number of trainable parameters, it
would also be the least likely to overfit. As hypothesized here, every further setting on the models
for comparison converged sooner than 10 epochs, and the models are explored further in the
following section.
II.
EXPERIMENT II: DETERMINING THE BEST MODEL FOR THE MULTI-LABEL
CLASSIFICATION TASK
Three approaches to implementing this multi-label classification task will be explored in this
section, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. The following figure is a
representation of the respective model architectures:
Figure 3:
Model Training Methods
Model
(a)
describes a set of binary label classifiers.
In this method, two separate ResNet152
architectures are trained, one using the Pulmonary Edema label and the other, the Pleural Effusion
label. The final layer is augmented to a fully connected linear layer, with one output activated by
a sigmoid function. The advantage of this approach is that the architecture can focus on fitting to
a single target variable, rather than multiple variables. Therefore, the model expected to perform
well on prediction accuracy. However, the time involved in training multiple classifiers is a major
disadvantage compared to models (b) and (c).
Model
(b)
describes a multi-label classifier. In this
method, one ResNet152 architecture is trained
with both labels as the input. The final layer is augmented to a fully connected linear layer, with
two outputs activated by a sigmoid function, corresponding to the pulmonary edema and pleural
effusion labels. The scaleup in training time is the major advantage offered by this approach,
however there is an expected tradeoff in prediction accuracy due to the same architecture, now
having to fit to two labels.
Model
(c)
describes a multi-class classifier. The
use of a multi-class classifier for a multi-label
classification task is counterintuitive. However, when considering that pulmonary edema and
pleural effusion are conditions that often present together in patients, the dataset of ~34,000 is
skewed towards cases with the labels (0, 0) or (1, 1). More specifically, here is a table showing
the value counts of radiographs for the different combinations of labels:
(Pulmonary Edema, Pleural Effusion)
Number of Radiographs with these labels
(0, 0)
11548
(0, 1)
5709
(1, 0)
2310
(1, 1)
14136
Table 2:
Composition of the Training Dataset
As seen in Table 2, about ~26,000 of the training images account for cases with neither conditions
present or both conditions present. Therefore, a multi-label classifier is likely to fit in such a
manner, where the prediction of one label dictates the prediction of the other label, leading to
misclassifications in cases where only one of the conditions are present in the radiograph.
Therefore, with an ample number of training cases in each of the categories as shown in Table 2,
it would be worthwhile to investigate a training method where the loss calculated during trainingis weighted by a proportion inverse to its label representation in the dataset. Therefore, this class
imbalance is addressed by reframing the multi-label classification task as a multi-class
classification task where the array of labels are collapsed as: {(0, 0): 0, (0, 1): 1, (1, 0): 2, (1, 1):
3}, into 4 classes. Then, using the value counts from Table 2, class weights are calculated and
accounted for in the model training process. For this classifier, the final layer is augmented to a
fully connected linear layer, with four outputs activated by a softmax function, with each output
corresponding to prediction confidence probability of each class. Once the model provides its
prediction on the test data, the four outputs are concatenated using those probabilities in the
following manner:
Prediction for Presence of Pulmonary Edema:
(0 * P(0))
+ (0 * P(1)) + (1 * P(2)) + (1 * P(3))
Prediction for Presence of Pulmonary Edema:
(0 * P(0))
+ (1 * P(1)) + (0 * P(2)) + (1 * P(3))
This is done instead of just extracting the maximum argument from the prediction and the label
class it is associated with, in order to get a more exact representation of what the model has
learned. By accounting for the class imbalance, it is expected that this model would perform
better than its counterpart (b), and has the same computational resource and time efficiency
advantages from (b) as well. Models (a) and (b) are converged on binary cross-entropy loss, while
model (c) is converged on weighted categorical cross-entropy loss. Both these loss functions are
the standard used in classification algorithms.
MODEL TRAINING SETTINGS
I.
Loss Function:
In the case of the single label and
multi label classifiers with a sigmoid activated
output layer, the model is fitted using binary cross entropy as the loss function. Binary cross
entropy measures the difference between the predicted output probabilities and the true labels,
and penalizes the model for incorrect predictions. It is defined as the negative sum of the
logarithm of the predicted probabilities for the correct class, and is commonly used in conjunctionwith a sigmoid activation function in the output layer of the neural network. The multi-class
classifier with a softmax activated output layer is fitted using class weighted categorical cross
entropy. Categorical Cross Entropy measures the dissimilarity between the predicted probability
distribution and the true probability distribution, and penalizes the model for incorrect
predictions. It is defined as the negative sum of the logarithm of the predicted probability for the
true class, where the predicted probabilities are normalized by a softmax function to ensure that
they sum up to one. Class weighted categorical cross entropy is a variation of the categorical
cross entropy loss function that is used in multi-class classification problems where the classes
are imbalanced. Class weighted categorical cross entropy addresses this issue by assigning a
weight to each class proportional to its inverse frequency in the training set. This means that the
loss contribution of rare classes is increased during training, while the loss contribution of
frequent classes is decreased. This would allow the model to generalize better.
II.
Optimizer:
All the models are trained using the Adam
optimizer, which is a popular optimization
algorithm used in deep learning that adapts the learning rate based on the gradient of the loss
function with respect to the model parameters. Adam maintains a moving average of the gradient
and the squared gradient, and uses these estimates to update the learning rate for each parameter
in a way that scales the learning rate differently for each parameter. This means that Adam can
handle noisy or sparse gradients and converge faster than other optimization algorithms. Adam is
a popular choice for many deep learning models and has been shown to be effective in achieving
high accuracy with minimal tuning of the hyperparameters.
III.
Early Stopping:
For every training setting, early
stopping is instituted with a tolerance of rising
validation loss on three epochs. Early stopping is a technique used to prevent overfitting in
machine learning models. Early stopping works by monitoring the performance of the model on a
validation set during training and stopping the training process when the validation error starts to
increase or stops decreasing.RESULTS
The following figures and table show the results of the best model obtained for the methods (a), (b) and
(c). The first set of figures are the confusion matrices of the model predictions for the Pulmonary Edema
Label on an unseen test set (n = 3371). A confusion matrix visualizes the number of true positives, false
positives, false negatives and true negatives. The raw outputs of each model were converted to binary
predictions at the threshold 0.5:

DISCUSSION
In this project, I investigated the effectiveness of progressively unfreezing blocks of layers in the large
ResNet152 architecture for a binary-label classification task involving pulmonary edema and pleural
effusion, and found that this technique led to a speed-up in model convergence before overfitting
occurred, which improved the overall efficiency of the model. I also compared the performance of
multiclass and multilabel classifiers for this task, and found that the multiclass classifier was a more
efficient method when considering training time, with little to no tradeoff in overall prediction accuracy or
model discriminability. Framing the multi-label classification task as a multi-class classification task was
essential in accounting for the imbalance in training cases where either condition was observed in
isolation. As seen in Figures 6, 7 and 8, the multi-class model outperformed the multi-label classifier in
terms of discriminability and accuracy. However, it needs to be noted that extending this investigation to
multi-label tasks with significantly more than 2 labels may not be feasible due to the difficulty in finding
sufficient training data for every combination of labels. These findings provide valuable insights into the
optimization of deep learning models for medical image classification tasks, specifically for binary-label
classification tasks involving pulmonary edema and pleural effusion. The results suggest that
progressively unfreezing blocks of layers and using multiclass classifiers can lead to more efficient and
accurate models for this type of task.

Abstract
Dimensionality reduction, typically applied to data in order to make it more usable
and generally easier to model, is often used to understand neural spike data, which
is typically very complex due to its high-dimensional nature. Through latent factor
modeling, we can effectively apply dimensionality reduction to this data and create
lower dimensional representations of it. With data compiled from the International
Brain Lab, we applied a Variational Latent Gaussian Process model (vLGP) in
order to extract latent trajectories from the data collected within the motor cortex.
These trajectories are separated into four distinct categories, representing the
activity from the designated brain region when the mouse moves the wheel in one
direction correctly in response to the stimulus, or when the mouse moves the wheel
in the incorrect direction. These trajectories reveal linear separability between
the correct decisions in different directions (when the mouse turns the wheel
clockwise correctly versus when the mouse turns the wheel counter-clockwise
correctly). Comparing this model to Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA),
another dimensionality reduction technique - reveals that vlGP produces cleaner
and more interpretable trajectories while also being more scalable to larger amounts
of data without running into memory issues.
1 Introduction
The brain is an intricate and complex system that deals with hundreds of thousands of simultaneous
processes at the same time. In order to truly understand the brain we must carefully observe it,
knowing that we only have access to input stimuli and output of the neurons we are observing. The
actual calculations themselves, computed by the “Neural Network” of the brain, are unseen by us,
and thus must be inferred to gain a clearer understanding of what the brain is truly doing.
The reality of the situation is that there are up to billions of neurons in the brain. While we
cannot observe them all, the ones we can observe yield data in very high dimensions. This is where
the importance of dimensionality reduction comes in. There are two main reasons why reducing the
dimensionality is extremely useful when dealing with neural data. The first, most obvious reason is
that a smaller and less noisy subspace is simply much easier to understand and internalize than the
raw data in huge dimensions. Secondly, dimensionality reduction is a key tool in understanding the
true nature of the neural circuit and its computations as it allows us to describe and simplify a set of
complex variables in order to explore the unobserved, lower dimensional, variables that may explain
36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022).their relation. Last quarter we focused on gathering the necessary tools in order to create models and
conduct meaningful analysis from neural data, by developing factor analysis and Gaussian Process
Factor analysis models for use on dummy data.
In this project, we aim to apply these methods, including an additional method, Variational
Latent Gaussian Process, on real-world neuron data, collected from the International Brain Lab, in
order to find relationships between mouse behavior and neuron activity.
1.1 Literature Review and Prior Work
Due to the nature of the problem, many studies have been done on dimensionality reduction techniques
and methodologies for analyzing neural data. Yu et al. [ 2] explain that “neural responses are a
reflection of internal processing rather than external stimuli drive”, and that in behavioral tasks that
involve perception, decision making, etc. are best analyzed on a trial-by-trial basis, rather than
averaging neural data across trials. They introduce the GPFA model, which “unifies smoothing
and dimensionality reduction operations in a common, probabilistic framework. Zhao, Yuan, and
Memming [ 3] take this one step further, explaining that compared to previous methods such as GPFA,
vLGP achieves a substantially higher performance for predicting omitted spike trains. Compared to
previous methods, vLGP is faster and yields better predictability at a fine time scale to reveal hidden
neural dynamics from large-scale neural recordings.
After our work last quarter, we realized that GPFA would have some shortcomings when used on
the IBL data. Since the dataset is more closely aligned with a Poission distribution, the Gaussian
observations from the GPFA model were not optimal for reducing dimensionality in the neural data
we were feeding it. Namely, we started running into issues with scalability, with GPFA unable to fit
or infer if given all the data at once. Thus, we switched to Variational Latent Gaussian Processes,
which aim to remedy this problem by using Poisson observations, which operate much better in
small(millisecond) time ranges. The following figure shows the difference in calculated trajectories
between PCA, GPFA, and vLGP on dummy data:
1.2 Dataset
The data analyzed were collected by the International Brain Lab, which aimed to produce standardized
and reproducible measurements of decision-making in mice [ 1]. Their experiment involved mice
trained in a task to move a vertical grating, which randomly appeared at −35◦,−0◦, or35◦azimuth,
to the center of the screen using a wheel. During this task, Neuropixel probes in the mouse’s brain
collect electrophysiology measurements. See figure 1 for the experimental setup.
The position of the probes was determined such that they cover all major brain areas of the left
hemisphere, and the right cerebellum, since connections between the cerebrum and cerebellum cross
hemispheres. See figure 2 for the probe locations. The raw data consists of voltage potentials across
384 channels over time. Action potentials, referred to as spikes, were determined from this raw data.
Using the waveform of the spikes, IBL used a modified version of the Kilosort 2.5 algorithm to find
clusters, which are individual neurons or multiple neurons that always fire together, referred to as
units. Each probe was precisely placed according to the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas, thus the location
of every channel is known, allowing us to plot the spikes over time and their depths. See figure 3.
2Figure 1: Diagram of the experimental setup showing vertical grating, and a correct vs incorrect
response.
Figure 2: Coordinates of where Neuropixel probes were inserted.
During the task, the mouse is simultaneously shown the vertical grating, and a 5 kHz sine wave
was played for 100ms. The mouse is given a reward of 1.5 µL water if it correctly completes the task,
and a noise burst is played if it incorrectly completes the task.
Our analyses were focused on the Primary Motor Cortex (MOp) of a single mouse across
hundreds of trials. The motor cortex was selected because latent trajectories should be more distin-
guishable between different mouse behaviors, which would allow us to classify the latent trajectories,
and eventually predict the mouse’s behavior. We attempt to differentiate trajectories between 4
different trial types, the wheel turned clockwise incorrectly, and the wheel turned counter-clockwise
incorrectly.
2 Methods
Raw electrophysiology data is very high dimensional and contains a lot of noisy, spiky activity. Due
to this, it must be heavily processed before the accurate neural trajectories can be extracted. We
utilized two important methods in our study that are able to both process and model our complex
datasets: Gaussian Process Factor Analysis and Variational Latent Gaussian Processes.

right side.
2.1 Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA)
Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA) is a probabilistic modeling technique used to infer low-
dimensional structure from high-dimensional time series data. The method is based on the idea
of representing each high-dimensional time series as a linear combination of a small number of
underlying latent factors that vary smoothly over time.
GPFA models the observed data, y, as a linear combination of low-dimensional latent variables,
z, using a Gaussian process. The latent variables are modeled as a Gaussian process with mean, m,
and covariance function, kz(zi, zj). The observed data is modeled as a linear combination of the
latent variables, given by y=Cz+ϵ, where Cis a loading matrix and ϵis a noise term.
The goal of GPFA is to infer the latent variables and the loading matrix given the observed data.
This can be done using maximum likelihood estimation by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data,
given by:
logp(y|C,m,kz) =−1
2yTK−1
yy−1
2log|Ky| −n
2log(2π)
where Ky=CCT+σ2Iis the covariance matrix of the observed data and σ2is the noise vari-
ance. The optimization problem can be solved using iterative algorithms, such as the expectation-
maximization (EM) algorithm or the gradient descent algorithm.[2]
The solution provides estimates of the latent variables and the loading matrix, which were used
to uncover patterns in our mouse’s brain activity.
2.2 Variational Latent Gaussian Processes (vLGP)
Variational Latent Gaussian Process (vLGP) is an extension of Gaussian Process Factor Analysis that
incorporates a variational inference framework to allow for more efficient and scalable inference.
This also allows for a more flexible approach to modeling time-series data. For example, in our case
the prior distribution fed into our model is Gaussian while the posterior distribution that is solved for
is Poisson. This allows us to create a model more closely aligned with real world neural data.
The goal of the vLGP is to infer the posterior distribution, q(z|x), over the latent variables given
the observed data. This is done using variational inference by minimizing the objective function, also
4known as the evidence lower bound (ELBO), given by:
ELBO =−DKL(q(z|x)||p(z)) +Eq(z|x)[log(p(y|z, x))]
where DKLis the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which measures the difference between two distribu-
tions, and E is the expected value. The first term in the ELBO encourages the approximate posterior,
q(z|x), to be close to the prior, p(z), while the second term represents the negative log-likelihood of
the data given the latent variables [3].
The solution to the optimization problem provides estimates of the latent variables, which can
be used to reconstruct the hidden patterns in the data. For the purposes of our project, vLGP is used
to extract neural trajectories, which are the underlying patterns in neural activity that reflect how the
brain processes information.
2.3 Data Preparation for vlGP and GPFA
Prior to running the vlGP model, we spent a great deal of time preparing the data and getting it
into a format which would allow vLGP to produce good trajectories. The first step in this process
was to filter our data by the spikes produced in our brain regions of interest - the primary motor
cortex. Once we obtained the spikes within our regions of interest, we filtered once more to keep
only the “good spikes”, which are the spikes which pass all three of the metric tests conducted by
IBL themselves. At this point, we had significantly reduced the amount of spikes being analyzed,
leaving us with a cleaner, yet very informative data set to work with. After filtering, we worked on
getting the data into the correct format to pass into the model. This consisted of two steps: aligning
our spikes, and binning them appropriately. We chose to align the spikes based on the mouse’s first
movement, analyzing the spikes from 100 milliseconds before the first movement up to 1000 ms after
this movement. This method of alignment gave us important insight into how the neuron activity and
latent variables change throughout the entire process of the mouse making a decision, from the mouse
thinking about the decision before moving, the mouse moving the wheel, and the potential neuron
activity after the mouse’s first movement. After aligning our spike times, we binned each trial by 50
milliseconds - where the index of each row represented time, and each column was a specific neuron,
with entries representing the number of times in which that particular neuron fired between bins. The
motivation for binning in this format is that, upon passing multiple trials - each binned by 50ms -
we are able to examine neural spike activity within each trial, which is revealed by each individual
trajectory for a specific decision. With this in mind, we separated the trials into two categories: when
the mouse rotated the wheel clockwise and when the mouse rotated the wheel counterclockwise.
To prepare our data for GPFA, we underwent the same initial filtering process to obtain the
appropriate neurons within our brain regions of interest. We also aligned our spikes and binned them
in the same way. However in order to fit the model, we had to convert our data into SpikeTrain
objects, which take in the trial start time, end time, and an array of times in which the neurons fired
over the length of a trial. These SpikeTrain objects were passed into the GPFA model, and from this
we were able to generate trajectories. Similarly to vlGP, we separated the data into two categories
mentioned above, allowing us to observe the difference in activity in our regions of interest between
the decision to turn the wheel left versus right.
2.4 Classification
After extracting trajectories from our data preparation process, our aim was to determine the time at
which we could best observe a clear separation between the trajectories of the two different trial types,
counterclockwise and clockwise wheel rotation. We determined this time by plotting our trajectories
in a 3-dimensional space and testing on data from multiple different mice, who all exhibited unique
trajectories. Eventually, upon achieving trajectories that had an interval of clear separation between
categories, we were able to build our Logistic Regression classification model.
The time where we observed separation happened to be around 100 milliseconds after the mouse
began moving in each trial. The latent feature data from each trial, at the time of separation, was
then separated into four categories: clockwise and correct, counterclockwise and correct, clockwise
and incorrect, and counterclockwise and incorrect. The aim of the separation at this point was
to see if we could achieve separability within each individual trajectory regarding whether that
decision was correct or not, and to check the strength of classification between the clockwise and
counterclockwise trajectories. This was done using two Logistic Regression classifiers. First we
5compared clockwise against counterclockwise, and then we compared clockwise and correct against
clockwise and incorrect.
3 Results
After fitting both vlGP and GPFA models with two latent variables, and experimenting with different
mice, we obtained the following trajectories plotted over time:
Figure 4: vLGP
 Figure 5: GPFA
Looking at the above figures, we can see that in both models, we achieve separability between
the trajectories for left and right movements between 0 and 200 milliseconds for both plots. For both
plots, we used data from this interval of separation in order to train our logistic regression model.
Upon zooming into the plots, when time is equal to 100 milliseconds, we observe the following for
vlGP (Figure 6) and GPFA (Figure 7):
Figure 6: vLGP
 Figure 7: GPFA
Our hypothesis was that, when observing separable trajectories such as our results above, a
classification algorithm should accurately predict which way the mouse would turn the wheel based on
the brain’s neural trajectories. This hypothesis proved true, as our classification algorithm performed
very well on test data in both models, achieving 93% balanced accuracy using trajectories from vLGP,
and 91% accuracy using trajectories from GPFA.
6Figure 8: vLGP
 Figure 9: GPFA
We also hypothesized that separating trials by whether or not the mouse was correct in the
direction it moved the wheel would not help us achieve separability, and this was proven true upon
analysis of correctness at the times when we observed statistical significance. Looking at Figures
8 and 9, we can see that the latent variables behave similarly when the wheel was moved correctly
to the right versus incorrectly to the right, and this is likely because the mouse thinks that moving
the wheel to the right is the correct decision regardless of whether it actually is or not, and thus the
activity observed in the brain is not very different and follows the same properties in both cases. This
conclusion is further reinforced by the fact that, upon training the classifier to predict whether or not
the mouse’s decision to move the wheel was correct, the balanced accuracy of our trained classifier
was around 50% for both our vlGP and GPFA trajectories. This reveals that a trained classifier’s
predictions are no better than a random guess between the two possible categories, and thus the
decision to not separate by correctness proved fruitful.
4 Discussion
Our results indicate that using vLGP trajectories to predict decision making is more effective than
using GPFA trajectories. There are multiple potential reasons behind why we observed such a
difference in performance. For one, raw neural data is very erratic, with action potentials lasting only
for 2 to 4 milliseconds, and with many action potentials occurring all at once. Our vLGP model did
better at capturing this quality of our data than GPFA which always gives very smooth results. In
addition, The slight difference in accuracy between our model trained on vLGP trajectories and our
model trained on GPFA trajectories can be attributed to the fact that our trajectories for vLGP had
better separability than those of GPFA. The fact that we had better separability for vLGP reveals that
the distribution of our data aligns more closely with that of a Poisson distribution than a Gaussian
distribution, and therefore we were able to observe the distinction between the decision trajectories
more clearly, and the classifier was more accurate in differentiating between categories.
In addition, when it came to prediction, we initially wanted to classify between the four categories
of left and correct, left and incorrect, right and correct, and right and incorrect, and we struggled to
get separable trajectories for each of these categories. This struggle was present for several reasons,
the first being the fact that within the decision trajectories themselves, correct and incorrect decisions
exhibit the same behavior, which makes sense due to the fact that the mouse made its decision thinking
it was the correct choice, and thus the thought process for choosing right or choosing left is uniform
regardless of correctness. Secondly, our analysis was conducted only using data from one brain region
at a time, in the mouse where we observed separable trajectories, we only examined the spikes from
the motor cortex. The motor cortex is largely responsible for movement, and thus examining only
this region does not provide us with insight whether or not the mouse was thinking about whether
the decision was correct or not after making it. If we wanted to categorize the trajectories by both
correctness and decision, we should have monitored the activity of another brain region at the same
time intervals which we analyzed the motor cortex, perhaps the prefrontal cortex, and this would have
shed more light as to how neural activity can be different for an incorrect vs. correct decision.
Another important aspect of our investigation was determining the ideal brain region to analyze,
which ended up being the motor cortex, which is heavily involved in movement. We initially looked
7at the visual field, since the mice are presented with a visual stimulus and are tasked with responding
to it. The resulting trajectories, however, did not exhibit any separability, and ultimately a classifier
would not have performed well when trained on these trajectories. This could be due to the fact that
we did not give enough time before the mouse’s first movement when we were aligning our spikes in
our data preparation, as we only looked at the data before the first movement for 100 milliseconds, but
included spike data from up to 1000 milliseconds after the first movement. This could explain why
analyzing the primary motor cortex gave better trajectories. Perhaps if we reversed this alignment,
and looked at more data before the first movement, while the mouse was processing the stimulus, we
could have achieved more separable results from analyzing the visual field. What’s important to take
away from this is that when analyzing neural data, we must pick our brain region very carefully, and
make sure that the data preparation allows us to maximize results from that region.

Introduction 
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are a popular method for identifying inherited genetic variants 
associated with risk for certain phenotypes or disease traits.
13
These studies first survey the genome to 
determine which nucleotides individuals have at which genomic positions. The variations in these 
individual positions, called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are then associated with diseases or 
phenotypes like lung cancer or height.
13
Genetic variations
in non-protein coding regions of the genome 
can modulate expression levels of proteins while genetic variations in protein coding regions of the 
genome can alter proteins themselves. Both of these changes can affect functions of cells inside the 
body.
13
These small variations are responsible for
phenotypes ranging from obesity to autoimmune 
diseases.
13
For example, sickle cell anemia stems
from a mutation on a gene responsible for encoding the 
hemoglobin molecule on red blood cells.
14
Due to the
mutation, red blood cells are formed in a sickle 
shape and can block blood flow leading to fatigue, pain, and organ dysfunction.
14
If disease risk is 
discovered early on in one’s life preventative measures can be taken to decrease the likelihood of 
developing the disease or additional screenings can be scheduled to monitor an individual and catch the 
disease before it causes untreatable damage.
14
Understanding
how genetic expression translates to the 
observable traits is a necessary step towards providing insights for disease risk, prevention, and 
heritability.
Expression
quantitative
trait
loci
(eQTLs)
are
single
nucleotide
polymorphisms
(SNPs)
that
are 
significantly
associated
with
gene
expression.
Previous
studies
have
applied
linear
models
to
associate 
genotype
with
gene
expression
and
call
eQTLs.
1
The
numerous
resulting
associations
are
significantly 
confounded
by
linkage
disequilibrium
(LD),
and
are
therefore
insufficient
to
determine
causal 
relationships
between
SNPs
and
gene
expression.
2
Linkage
disequilibrium
causes
proximal
genetic 
variants
to
be
inherited
together,
meaning
that
individual
variants
are
not
inherited
independently.
2
Further 
methods
development
is
required
to
determine
functional
significance
from
eQTL
mapping. 
Fine-mapping
provides
a
suite
of
methods
to
determine
high-confidence
SNPs
likely
to
include
causal 
variants
by
incorporating
linkage
disequilibrium
information,
and
can
be
performed
with
software
tools 
such as susieR.
11
There
have
been
recent
advances
in
the
1000
Genomes
Project
leading
to
a
high-coverage
whole-genome 
sequencing
dataset
for
the
1000
Genomes
Project
cohort.
7
Sequencing
coverage
could
have
a
significantimpact
on
the
detection
of
SNPs
and
allele
frequencies
used
for
eQTL
analysis.
Reanalyzing
eQTLs
and 
causal
variants
with
an
increased
coverage
dataset
could
result
in
improved
eQTL
identification
and
better 
location of causal SNPs.
Results 
To call eQTLs, we obtained genotype data from the 1000 Genomes Project for both standard coverage 
and 30x coverage for chromosome 22.
7
We then obtained
previously published gene expression data from 
a subset of individuals in the 1000 Genomes Project.
1
Both the genotype and gene expression data were 
sequenced from lymphoblastoid cell lines.
1,7
When calling significant cis-eQTLs by testing all possible SNPs within 500kb of a gene on the lower 
coverage dataset, we performed 1,802,930 association tests and identified 4,035 significant cis-eQTLs 
(p-value < 5e-8, Fig 1A). When performing a parallel analysis on the higher coverage dataset, we 
performed 2,151,453 association tests and identified 4,321 significant cis-eQTLs (p-value < 5e-8, Fig 
1B).

15
To

this
locus,
we
analyzed
p-values 
from

from
SNPs
within
500
kilobases
of

In
both
the

we
identify

that
are
significantly
associated
with

gene expression (-log10(p-value) > 8, Fig.

Discussion and Future Directions 
In this work, we develop a framework for determining significant SNP-gene associations and 
fine-mapping these associations to identify candidate causal variants for gene expression. We apply this 
framework to both low and high coverage genotype datasets obtained from the 1000 Genomes Project. In 
this work, we identify a greater number of eQTLs using higher coverage data than lower coverage data.
When performing fine-mapping for SNPs near the
FAM118A
gene locus, we find that a higher coverage 
dataset identifies a larger set of potential causal SNPs than the lower coverage dataset. However, both 
analyses lead to candidate SNPs with the same posterior inclusion probability, indicating that a single 
causal SNP could not be identified from both analyses.
This general framework could be applied to genome-wide eQTL and fine-mapping studies to determine 
how experimental design parameters like sequencing coverage can impact downstream analyses of 
genetic variation, and can be weighed against factors like experimental cost.
One of the major drawbacks of our analysis is the presence of population-level structures within our data. 
These population-level structures could confound our gene expression information, and therefore affect 
the cis-eQTL associations that we discover. To improve this analysis, in both our eQTL mapping and 
fine-mapping, we could include PEER factors to account for these structures.
1,17
Another future direction for this work is to compare our fine-mapping results with functional enrichment 
analyses using ATAC-seq data from the Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium, and relating eQTLs to 
biological pathways using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).

Abstract
Understanding how genetic variation impacts gene expression can help us identify
gene-based mechanisms of disease risk. For the last two decades, genome-wide association
studies (GW AS) have been utilized to identify disease-associated genetic variants. However ,
these associated variants often do not lie in gene exons, creating uncertainty as to which genes
are associated with disease. Our project aims to fill this gap by leveraging a technique known as
transcriptome-wide association studies (TW AS). TWAS is a powerful strategy that can detect
gene–trait associations if variation in the expression of a gene colocalizes with phenotypic
variation. It combines expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data with GW AS summary
statistics to identify disease-associated genes. We leverage gene expression and genotype data
from the 1000 Genomes project and GW AS from UK Biobank. Here, we focused our analysis on
Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Ultimately , the identification of disease-associated genes will
accelerate the development of therapeutics and treatment options for patients.
Intr oduction
Identifying the gene-based mechanism of disease risk is crucial to facilitate early
diagnosis and treatment of individuals. Previous approaches attempted to understand this
mechanism by detecting key variants associated with gene expression, which in turn is
responsible for regulating the production of certain key proteins that can lead to the presence of
certain diseases
1
. For example, GW AS finds thousands
of trait-associated variants, h
owever , 93%
of disease and trait-associated variants emer ging from these studies lie within noncoding
sequence
s of the DNA
2
.  This makes it dif ficult to
understand the functionality of these variants
and their association with disease risk. In addition, it is infeasible to measure gene expression in
as many people that are in a GW AS cohort.
In order
to address these concerns, a new technique
called eQTL  colocalization was developed. It leverages transcriptomic data in order to inform
gene discovery by connecting non-coding disease-associated variants to changes in transcript
levels
3
. Colocalization determines whether a single
variant is responsible for both GW AS and
eQTL  signals in a locus, however this approach is often underpowered
4
. For our project, we
decided to use a technique called TWAS that aggregates variant ef fects on gene expression and
estimates a gene level association
5
.
TWAS aims to identify genes that lead to manifestation of complex human traits due to
genetically regulated transcriptional activity
6
. It
integrates genome-wide association studies
(GW AS) and gene expression datasets to identify gene–trait associations
.
TWAS leverages
eQTL  cohorts with expression and genotype data to discover gene–trait associations from GW ASsummary statistics. The eQTL  cohort is then used to find predictive models of gene expression
by using allele counts of genetic variants in the gene’ s vicinity
7
. The model is then used to
impute the genetic component of gene expression in a lar ge sample of people with genotyping
results (ex. a GW AS cohort). Finally , TWAS correlates the disease phenotype and predicts gene
expression to find disease associated genes
8
. Ultimately
TWAS is powerful in identifying the
disease associated gene by aggregating the ef fects of multiple variants into a single testing unit
5
.
Identification of a gene, rather than just a variant, can enable scientists to create drugs tar geting a
specific gene that can potentially of fset or mitigate the ef fects of the associated disease.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a highly heritable disease, which causes a chronic
inflammation of tissues in an individual’ s digestive tract
9
. This disease af fects 3.1 million adults
in the United States and adversely impacts their quality of life
10
. Even though GW AS has
identified hundreds of variants associated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), there are few
known associated genes. For our project we decided to leverage TWAS to identify the genes
associated with IBD. To this end, we utilized gene expression data from whole blood samples
because IBD is an immune disease and blood will contain the relevant cell types. We applied
TWAS to this data and found 7 genes associated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Our analysis
not only found genes that were previously known to be associated with IBD but it found more as
well. This can help scientists create drugs in the future that can tar get a specific gene, potentially
offsetting the ef fects of IBD.
M e t h o d s
Data:
The genotype data that we worked with was collected from Phase 1 of the 1000 Genomes
Project, Release Version 3 for chromosome 22. This dataset contains data on millions of SNPs
for hundreds of individuals, which we attempt to connect to our gene expression dataset to
identify potential relationships. We combined this single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) data
with gene expression data from RNA-sequencing on LCL  samples from the Geuvadis
RNA-sequencing project, retrieved from EBI ArrayExpress. Together , these data sources contain
genetic data for 344 individuals across four populations: CEPH (CEU), Finns (FIN), British
(GBR), and Toscani (YRI). Combining these data sources, we are able to identify relevant SNPs
to each gene. We identified cis/local-SNPs as those found within 1Mb of the transcription start
site (TSS) of each gene from the Geuvadis project. We considered
SNPs that had a minor allele
frequency greater than 0.05 to be common, and obtained variant information for these SNPs
across all individuals.
To perform TWAS, we also required
the summary statistics of our chosen
disease, IBD.  The GW AS summary statistics for IBD were obtained from the analysis carried
out in the paper Finucane 2015, Nature Genetics.
Methods and Process Flow:In order to perform our analysis, we downloaded the genotype and gene expression data
from 1000 Genomes project, phase 1 release 3. We filtered the gene expression data to focus our
analysis on chromosome 22. We also retrieved additional information about the individual’ s
population groups and mer ged it with our gene expression data for these individuals. To work
with the genotype data, we used plink to convert the original VCF files into the bed, bim and fam
files containing the genotype information about the individuals. When extracting the genotype
information using plink we removed variants that were not biallelic and had an allele frequency
less than .05.
Once we identified the significantly heritable genes and their corresponding cis-SNPs
using the GCT A script, for each gene we created a linear model to predict gene expression,
weighted by the SNPs. We assume that SNPs additively contribute to a phenotype. For each
gene, this follows the following linear model:
=𝑦𝑖 𝑗∑𝑋𝑖𝑗β𝑗
where
represents the gene expression for an
individual
,
represents the estimated
minor𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑋𝑖𝑗
allele count of SNP
for the individual
, and
is an unknown
weight
on cis-SNP
. To estimate𝑗𝑖β𝑗𝑗
the set of
for each gene, we used three
different modeling techniques - lasso regression, elasticβ𝑗
net regression, and only using the single-best eQTL. Both lasso regression and elastic net are
regularization techniques that aim to reduce overfitting of our linear regression model. Lasso
regularization aims to do so by minimizing the following, using an L1 penalty:
||𝑦− 𝑗∑𝑋𝑖𝑗β𝑗||2+λ||β||
Elastic net regression minimizes the following error , using both L1 and L2 penalties:
||𝑦−𝑗∑𝑋𝑖𝑗β𝑗 ||2+λ1||β||+λ2||β||2
These two methods incorporate information from all of the cis-SNPs of a gene. With the
single-best eQTL  method, the estimated minor allele count for only the most significantly
associated SNP  was used to model a gene’ s expression. For this method, the rest of the SNP
weights are set to zero.After fitting these three models for each gene,
we performed the summary-based
imputation TWAS analysis.
To perform the analysis, for each gene we use each set of the model
weights obtained above along with GW AS summary statistics for IBD for the corresponding
cis-SNPs. Letbe the
standardized GW AS ef fect
sizes of the corresponding SNPs on the trait.𝑍
We impute the ef fect size of the expression-trait association using a linear combination of the
estimated weights
with
. To test for significance,
our null hypothesis is that there is noβ𝑍
association and that
follows a multivariate normal
distribution
, whereis the𝑍𝑍∼𝑁(0,Σ)Σ
covariance/LD matrix among all SNPs
. Under these assumptions,
has a variance of
,β𝑇𝑍β𝑇Σ β
and the standardized imputed Z-score of the association is as follows:
β𝑇𝑍/ (β𝑇Σ β)1/2
We then compute imputed Z-scores for every gene with relation to IBD using each of the
different regression methods and identify the best-performing model for each gene. We can then
use these standardized Z-scores to calculate p-values and identify significant associations
between genes and the presence of IBD. This methodology is particularly useful as it allows us
to impute gene expression into the GW AS summary-based data and exploit the GW AS data’ s
large sample size to draw significant associations.
Discussion
From our initial sample of 633 genes, we identified 100 that were significantly heritable. Of
these 100 genes, 7 were found to have a significant association with IBD. These 7 significant
genes are illustrated in Fig. 1.
Fig. 1
Five of the seven significant genes are very close together and share the same best GW AS SNP ,
indicating that they might contribute to the same signal. This highlights TWAS’s ability to
identify the actual genes associated with a particular disease, rather than just the GW AS SNPs.
From the figure above, we find that PDGFB had the most significant association with a p-value
of 4.17 x 10
-17
.
For each gene, we were able to identify which modeling technique performed the best. Fig. 2
depicts this distribution.
Fig 2.
For significant genes, elastic net regression and using single-best eQTL  were the best performing
models for three genes each, and lasso regression was the best model for only one.
In addition, we found that the R
2
for each gene was
reasonably bounded by heritability . This is to
be expected and hence serves as a sanity check for our findings.
Fig 3.
Conclusion
In conclusion, TWAS was ultimately able to identify 7 genes that are associated with IBD
One of the genes, A4GAL T, did not have any genome-wide significant GW AS SNPs nearby .
This highlights that TWAS is able to find relevant genes even if that locus is not genome-wide
significant in GW AS. It was also interesting to see that our findings could be verified by other
sources. For example, Marigorta et. al (2017) showed that there was an association between
SYNGR1 and IBD, which our analysis was also able to identify . Thus, the use of a technique like
TWAS for the identification of these genes can be crucial for disease prevention and early
detection.

Abstract
Major insufficiencies in healthcare systems today leave patients and clinicians
alike wanting for a more effective way of receiving and giving care. Several ma-
jor deficiencies are 1) the lack of an integrated Electronic Health Record (EHR),
lifelog, and personal omics data, and 2) the lack of standardization across health-
care systems, data standards, and terminologies. This incompatibility creates
inefficiencies in operating personalized medicine, leading to problems with in-
teroperability and introducing ambiguity into the healthcare environment, espe-
cially amongst patients, their providers, and organizations. Our work focuses on
developing a data-integrated patient timeline dashboard. While many specialty-
specific and administrative clinical dashboards may already exist, there is not
much –if any– literature available that describes general clinical dashboards that
are oriented around patient care, can be used across various medical specialties,
and explain how computations on the dashboard are conducted. Our work aims to
consolidate the overwhelming amount of data and graphics in a patient’s medical
history into a single accessible platform. Key aspects of this dashboard include
options for what performance indicators to see, variety in the data sources being
used for visualization, and interactive capabilities for both patients and clinicians.
To accomplish the creation of this dashboard, we worked in two sub-teams, with
one focused on understanding the types of available data and standards to be
followed, researching relevant UI/UX practices to be followed when working with
medical data, and the other discovering potential software tools that can be used
to store this data and create dashboards.
1 Introduction
The healthcare industry is one that produces large quantities of data coming from a
wide variety of sources; however, the data is typically not accessible to or presented in
a way that is useful for a patient or their healthcare provider. Patient data can come
from an assortment of sources - prior physicians, wearable devices, apps, etc - which
are typically not standardized with one another. This creates a lot of issues for clini-
cians. The lack of standardization discourages coherent patient health records and the
1inconsistency of data standards produces further problems with integration and inter-
operability of patients’ electronic records. The data inconsistency at the clinician also
reflects patients’ difficulties with accessing their health records. The current healthcare
infrastructure can often be a barrier for patients, leaving them unaware and uninformed
of their medical data and history.
The goal of our work is to integrate various sources of patient data into a single
patient timeline dashboard to allow clinicians, and patients to easily visualize a patient’s
current health status. Apart from the specialty-specific dashboards, our purpose is to
integrate a variety of data into a generalized stream of information with processed data
adhered to the medical industry standards. This would be an individualized resource
with consolidated patient data available to both an individual and their healthcare
provider. The problems existing in the healthcare space that our dashboard will attempt
to address are 1) medical dashboards not being designed with the patient in mind 2)
the non-existence of timeline visualizations integrating EHR with personal omics’ data
3) the inability of many existing dashboards to integrate data from different wearable
device sources and 4) the lack of personal trauma data in medical histories (something
that is often requested by patients)
2 Methods
Our dashboard is aimed at integrating data from a variety of sources - specifically,
wearable devices and electronic health records. Therefore, the initial phase of our
work focused on standardizing data from different sources. This was quite an exten-
sive process, as it required thorough data exploration, identification of useful metrics,
elimination of duplicate metrics, and standardization of units. We looked at data taken
from two specific wearable devices - Oura rings and Apple watches - as well as data
from patient electronic health records. We calculated important statistic functions -
such as Pearson correlation - from the data so that they could also be integrated into
the dashboard.
Once we had an initial set of usable data, the next step of the process was making
the data into a format that was compatible with our visualization tool, Tableau. We
selected Tableau as our primary visualization tool because of its ability to integrate
smoothly into web pages and because of its useful interactivity features. This was an
iterative process, in which the sub-team focused on data processing and worked with the
visualization team to debug any data-cleaning or standardizing issues and ensure that
the data format could be smoothly integrated into Tableau to create the visualizations
we needed.
In order for the data to be more compatible with Tableau, we created a pipeline
specifically designed to read in, clean, add features to, and subset the data. Our
pipeline currently utilizes Oura ring csv data and exports the cleaned version of these
files to one smaller csv that is easier for the front-end team to incorporate into Tableau
visualizations. Our pipeline removes null values using a threshold, meaning that rows
with null values are only removed if they contain entirely null values or more than
10 null values. Our pipeline also cleans timestamps for ease of integration with other
datasets, typecasts columns, and subsets the data to a desired date range.
Using the data we had, we created and tested three different predictive models
2using the Oura Ring sleep data that predicts whether the data point comes from a day
that was a weekend or weekday. Weekends can signify when patients were relaxing or
performing less strenuous tasks than on a weekday, so looked to see if we could predict
this based on their health data. The best performing model was the sklearn Nearest
Neighbor classifer(N = 2) which had .77 accuracy on the training set and .85 accuracy
on the test set. This prediction model shows that in the future we’ll be able to predict a
number of things using mobile health tracking devices. Cleaning and feature additions
such as these allow us to produce more accurate, compelling visualizations. Overall,
our data is saved at multiple stages in the pipeline, and the final, cleaned version is
exported to a directory for the convenience of the front-end team.
3 Results
After gathering all of the data, processing it, visualizing it using Tableau, and publishing
it to the website, our team established a product for the data-integrated dashboard
presented by Tableau. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of a user’s
health status, consolidating multiple sources of health data into one convenient location.
At this development stage, the dashboard includes a variety of metrics, such as
calories burned, total sleep hours, lowest heart rate, and Pearson Correlation graphs
between different pairs of variables (minutes awake, total calories burned, steps, total
sleep hours, lowest heart rate) all displayed on a per day scale. This allows users to
easily monitor their daily health status and track changes over time. Additionally, the
dashboard features user-selected years and months for dashboard display, which further
enhances the ability to track progress.
However, we did encounter some obstacles in regard to incorporating EHRs into the
dashboards. This posed a challenge due to HIPPA regulations and the need to protect
sensitive patient information. While we were unable to include this information in the
public-facing dashboard, we recognize the potential benefits of incorporating it in future
iterations of the project.
Furthermore, we also faced difficulties with incorporating direct user input of sig-
nificant life events into the annotation feature of Tableau. While this feature could
potentially add valuable insights to the dashboard, it would require further develop-
ment and testing to ensure its effectiveness.
4 Conclusion
The end result of our work was a single, integrated dashboard that provided patients
with a way to easily view, filter, and engage with their health data. This dashboard
is unique because it integrates data from multiple wearable technologies into a single
platform; it synthesizes the information from various useful sources and presents it
in a unified manner. The key strengths of our dashboard are the interactivity and
the customization. Users - including both patients and providers - are able to tailor
their viewing experience to best fit their needs, thanks to the filters and toggles on the
dashboard.
There were several challenges and obstacles we encountered when developing this
dashboard. For instance, there are many ethical considerations in involved with manip-
3ulating biometric data is very sensitive and confidential information. Therefore, because
of privacy-related concerns, we did not have much data to work with; we were limited
to using the data of three patients. There is a lot of potential for expanding upon
this dashboard. The immediate next step would be to incorporate data from EHRs
(specifically, EPIC), which would allow us to incorporate major medical procedures
and chronic conditions into patient timelines on the dashboard. Additionally, we would
like to automatize the data uploading and processing pipeline, as that would allow us
to scale the platform better to more patients. Finally, we are interested in getting more
detailed feedback from users in order to determine what features are helpful and how
we could possibly expand the functionality of the dashboard.
5 Appendix
We used pandas as the main tool to perform data cleaning and standardization for this
project. In order to clean and standardize the data, we removed null values using a
threshold strategy. Any row that contained 10 or more null values were removed, and
the remaining rows were left in the DataFrame.
In addition, we converted dates so that they were pandas datetime objects, and so
that they were easier to work with. In order to consolidate the data into one convenient
location, we needed to merge everything based on the date of collection. This is a
particularly interesting challenge in Oura, as each metric is recorded at different time
points. However, for the purposes of this project, we limited our data to metrics that
were recorded daily so that all of the metrics corresponded to one another.

 Introduction  
 In the past, work has been done in a prior  
 study that contained eye tracking data and  
 fMRI data of 20 subjects who viewed and  
 recalled the last 5 minutes of 2012 March  
 Madness basketball games (   Antony et al.,  
 2020   ). The researchers used the ending of  
 basketball games as a stimulus for surprise.  
 The paper looked at the ef fects that surprise  
 had on brain region activation. The paper  
 found that surprise was positively correlated  
 with brain activation in subcortical regions  
 associated with dopamine, game enjoyment,  
 and long-term memory . In addition,  
 significant voxel activity was found in  
 reward-related regions of the brain: ventral  
 tegmental area (VT A), nucleus accumbens  
 (NAcc), and prefrontal cortex.   They were   also able to find a strong correlation  
 between surprise and long-term memory . 
 The dataset was found from the database  
 OpenNeuro at

 The fMRI data of 20 subjects who viewed  
 and recalled the end (last 5 minutes) of 2012  
 March Madness basketball games is present.  
 Each subject viewed and recalled from  
 memory a set of three games from a total of  
 nine selected games. This data was used in  
 the original paper . The dataset is from 2019.  
 Of the 20 subjects, 14 are males and 6 are  
 females. The subjects’ ages ranged from 18 -  
 35. The data contains functional scans for  
 each subject for each task (view/recall) for  
 each run (i.e. one game). In addition, there  
 are event files which detail when the task  
 started and how long it lasted in seconds.  
 The event files provide a description of the  
 experiment. There are also confound files   2 
 which detail possible factors that need to be  
 accounted for as they could af fect the  
 significance results and conclusions of  
 analyses. The time-series fMRI data of each  
 subject while they recalled and viewed the  
 end of three basketball games allows for the  
 analysis of brain regions that are activated  
 during recall and viewing tasks to be  
 accomplished. A group analysis was  
 conducted because it allows for greater  
 generalizability to a much lar ger sample  
 since the results are more precise and  
 accurate than compared to just a  
 single-subject analysis.  
 Each subject had approximately 10 GBs of  
 preprocessed (smoothed/trimmed) fMRI  
 data. This results in about 200 GBs of usable  
 information for this project. This data was  
 used to represent approximately 271,000  
 voxels for every subject.  
 Methods  
 The pre-processed fMRI data for all 20  
 subjects was used for this project. There are  
 three runs for each subject, where each run  
 contains a view task and a recall task for an  
 individual basketball game.  
 For each run, the events file for view and  
 recall were combined to create a first level   design matrix. The design matrix was built  
 from timings of view and recall phases.  
 Next, a contrast matrix was formed by  
 finding the dif ference between view and  
 recall tasks.  
 Fig 1: Plot of the contrast matrix  
 Then, the contrast matrix (Fig 1) was used to  
 fit a first level General Linear Model  
 (GLM). Finally , the 
 nilearn.glm.compute_contrast method was  
 used to compute the ef fect size and ef fect 
 variance of the contrast of the model. Ef fect 
 size represents the magnitude of dif ference  
 between the view and recall runs. Ef fect 
 variance represents the variance of the  
 differences between the view and recall  
 tasks. These results were saved as .nii files.  
 For each subject, the variance across all  
 three runs was computed by using the  
 compute_fixed_ef fects method. The three  
 runs for each subject were combined into a  
 single average run. Then, these results were  
 used to compute the ef fect size and the  
 effect variance between all 20 subjects, also  
 3 
 known as random ef fects. Random ef fects  
 looks at each voxel and runs a regression  
 across subjects using the dif ference between  
 each subject. These ef fect sizes and ef fect 
 variances were stored into a folder and the  
 original pre-processed fMRI data was  
 deleted. This was done for storage purposes.  
 Instead of having to store all 200 GBs of  
 data at once, only storage of 87 MBs of data  
 as contrasts was needed.  
 The design matrix was made using a column  
 of ones of length 20, which is the number of  
 subjects used in the dataset. Nilearn’ s 
 SecondLevelModel method was used to  
 create the GLM for multiple subject fMRI  
 data. Then, a second level GLM was fitted  
 using the ef fect size for each subjects’  
 average run and the design matrix. Finally , a 
 z-map was made using the second level  
 GLM and multiple plots were created. These  
 plots (shown in the results section) all used  
 the same z-map and used various methods to  
 set dif ferent thresholds for the z-map. These  
 methods include uncorrected, false  
 discovery rate correction, and Bonferroni  
 correction.   Results  
 Fig 2: Ef fect Size contrasts of each subject  
 In Fig 2, the contrast maps (z-scores maps)  
 corresponding to the ef fect size were plotted  
 to visualize activation during viewing and  
 recall tasks for each of the 20 subjects.  
 There are similar general regions of  
 activation between the 20 subjects.  
 Fig 3: Plot cuts of a mask image using an  
 uncorrected p < 0.001  
 First, a second level contrast (z-map) from  
 the second level GLM was thresholded at an  
 uncorrected p-value of 0.001 (p < 0.001)  
 shown above in Fig 3. There is a 0.1%  
 4 
 chance of returning an inactive voxel as  
 active.  
 Fig 4: Plot cuts of a mask image using false  
 discovery rate correction and set cluster  
 threshold to 50 voxels  
 To remove some of the random data noise in  
 the previous contrast, another second level  
 contrast was created using a false discovery  
 rate correction. Since a p-value of 0.001 was  
 used, there is again a 0.1% chance of  
 returning an inactive voxel as active.  
 Clusters smaller than 50 voxels were  
 removed, leading to greater confidence that  
 the voxels identified as active are truly  
 active. The plot is shown above in Fig 4.  
 Fig 5: Plot cuts of a mask image using  
 Bonferroni correction   Last, a second level contrast was performed  
 using a strict Bonferroni correction in Fig 5  
 where the p-value is equal to (0.05) / (# of  
 voxels in overall z-map) = (0.05) / (61 x 73  
 x 61) = 0.05 / 271633 = 1.841 * 10   -7  . This  
 strict correction decreases the probability of  
 obtaining false-positive results. There is a  
 1.841 * 10   -5  probability of making any false  
 detections.  
 Fig 6: Interactive view of mask image slice  
 using false discovery rate correction  
 Of the z-maps created for each of the 3  
 methods, the z-map created using false  
 discovery rate correction was analyzed since  
 it was the second most strict of the methods.  
 An (x, y , z) position was chosen to look for  
 significant regions of activation. The chosen  
 position was (4, -24, 16). V oxel activity was  
 found in the occipital lobe (Fig 6), which is  
 the visual processing area of the brain. In  
 addition, there is significant voxel activity in  
 the Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dAcc),  
 which is associated with “executive control,  
 learning, adjustment, economic choice, and  
 self-control” (V oloh et al., 2021).  
 5 
 Conclusion  
 In conclusion, dif ferent results from the  
 original study were found. In   Antony et al.,  
 2020   , the paper found neural activity in the  
 ventral tegmental area (VT A), nucleus  
 accumbens (NAcc), and prefrontal cortex. In  
 this project, voxel activity in the occipital  
 lobe and the Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex  
 was observed. Significant voxel activity in  
 the prefrontal cortex, VT A, or in the NAcc  
 was not seen. This may be due to the paper  
 using dif ferent thresholds for their plots.  
 Another explanation could be that   Antony et  
 al., 2020   used a contrast other than ef fect 
 size or ef fect variance.   Refer ences

Q2 Project Report
Evaluating Fungal Feature Importance in Predicting Life
Expectancy for Cancer Patients
Abstract
This project aims to investigate the correlation between combined mycobiome data and
metadata with regards to cancer stage progression and mortality across various cancer types. The
research aims to identify the specific features linked to cancer staging and the duration between
diagnosis and death.
Introduction
Each year , an estimated 1.9 million Americans receive a cancer diagnosis (
Siegel et al.
).
Patient characteristics such as age, gender , and general health status can impact cancer
progression and response to treatment modalities like chemotherapy . Nonetheless, a crucial yet
often overlooked element that may hold significant sway is the patient's microbiome. While
humans possess approximately 20,000 genes in our DNA, we also harbor a substantial number of
microbial genes, ranging from 2 to 20 million throughout our various bodily microbiomes.
Furthermore, despite a 99.99% DNA  similarity between two strangers, their gut microbiomes
may only share 10% similarity .In numerous instances, the microbiome composition dictates medication ef ficacy and
disease susceptibility . For example, one study investigated the ef fectiveness of Cordyceps
militaris extract in overcoming carboplatin resistance in ovarian cancer and found that the extract
reduced the viability of carboplatin-resistant SKOV -3 cells and induced apoptosis. (Jo
et al.
)
Consequently , it is plausible that mycobiomes might partly contribute to the dif ferential cancer
progression rates observed in some individuals.
Literatur e Review and Discussion of Prior  Work
In the past, researchers have found that bacteria microbes were present in over 1500
tumors spanning seven types of cancer (
Nejman
et al
).
The study identified both cancer cells and
immune cells as being sites for microbiomes, and that the bacterial composition varied by cancer
type. Following this, researchers at the University of California, San Diego re-examined
sequencing studies in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) of 33 types of cancer from
treatment-naive patients (a total of 18,1 16 samples) for microbial reads (
Poore
et al
). They found
that they could diagnose cancer type in individuals with stage Ia–IIc cancer and cancers lacking
any genomic alterations. Furthermore, they were able to distinguish between healthy individuals
and individuals with multiple cancers solely using microbial signatures. Additionally , a paper
published earlier this year also found that multi-kingdom microbiota was ef fective at diagnosing
colorectal cancer (
Liu
et al
). These studies comprehensively
looked into the bacteria microbiome
within tumors, but what remained unknown was whether tumors contained fungi as well. And if
so, whether this fungi was useful in cancer detection, diagnosis, or treatment.
MethodsFirst, we obtained 2 feature tables from the original study examining cancer type
classification. These feature tables consisted of the final, cleaned TCGA  fungal counts and
metadata used in the study with 12773 total samples. Next, we preprocessed the metadata using a
combination of One Hot Encoding, Ordinal Encoding, Scaler , passthrough, and dropping
features. For days to death regression specifically , we filtered outliers greater than 10,000 days to
prevent them from skewing the data. We then imputed missing values, which were primarily
from the passthrough features, with the column mean and combined the transformed metadata
table with the fungal counts table.
For regression, we used scikit-learn to run lasso ridge regression with 10-folds cross
validation on both the fungal data and preprocessed metadata to predict the patients days to
death. We tried out other regression models as well including simple linear regression, bayesian
regression, and decision tree regression as well. The parameter for our primary model, lasso was
an alpha of 0.1
For classification, we made a gradient boosting classifier with stratified 10-folds cross
validation using scikit-learn. For the gradient boost classifier , we used exponential loss, learning
rate of 0.1, n-estimators 150, and max depth of 3.
Results
For our regression model, we found that the bayesian and decision tree models performed
much better than the lasso ridge regression and linear regression, when comparing the mean
squared errors.In our results, we generated AUROC and AUPR plots for our classification of cancer
stage. AUROC is the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, which basically shows
our true positive rate. The AUPR plot, or the area under the precision recall curve shows the
precision of our classifier .
We generated two Principal Coordinate Analysis plots, showing the separation between
stages as well as the separation between disease types by a euclidean distance metric. We can see
some similar clustering when comparing the two plots, indicating there likely being a relation
between the cancer stage and the specific cancer type. This could be a confounding caused by the
way that the data was collected, and may be something to explore in further research if there is
more data.
Finally , we generated bar plots showing the features that had the greatest importance in
our classification model. Overall the feature importance for all the stages was relatively similar ,
but there were some dif ferences especially when comparing between stage I and stage IV .
Discussion
Our study successfully achieved a high level of accuracy in classifying the stage of
various cancer tumors using a combination of metadata and counts data. Notably , the inclusion of
metadata in our model increased model performance compared to the original study . However ,
the features that our model identified as most important did not include any microbial features. It
is possible that the microbial features each had a relatively small ef fect on the model, making
them less significant than the metadata. Future studies may want to investigate methods to boost
the impact of microbial features.
Reducing the number of cancer stages to four may have contributed to our model's
performance by reducing the risk of inaccuracy in attempting to classify too many stages.
Additionally , our regression model for predicting days to death was a novel concept not
attempted in the original study . Despite utilizing only metadata and counts data, we achieved
respectable accuracy levels in our predictions.Works Cited

Abstract
In this study , we will be exploring the gut microbiome of Latin American immigrants to
determine what factors of their gut microbiome af fect metabolic diseases. The goal of our project
is to determine what metabolic diseases/disorders an individual has based on their gut
microbiome and other supporting information on the individual. To achieve our goal, we will
utilize a binary-relevance model for each disease type to see if we can predict if an individual has
that specified disease according to their microbiome factors.
1. Introduction
Metabolic diseases af flict millions of people in the US, with diseases such as diabetes,
high blood pressure, and obesity af fecting Latinos and other ethnic minority groups at a
significantly higher rate. One factor contributing to this multifaceted disparity is the fact that
minority groups are severely underrepresented in clinical research and health studies, resulting in
a continued lack of insight and solutions for these groups. Our project seeks to further metabolic
disease research and expand representation in such fields by studying how the gut microbiomes
of Hispanic populations are correlated with the prevalence of certain diseases. As the field of gut
microbiome research has grown, scientists have discovered links between gut microbiomes and
diseases like diabetes and obesity , as well as dif ferences in gut microbiomes by race and
ethnicity (
Duvallet, et al.
;
Ross, et al.
). Machine
learning solutions that can accurately determine
these links and scale across diverse gut microbial populations could provide useful general and
specific solutions for dif ferent diseases and dif ferent groups. As such, the main goal of our
project is to use the Study of Latinos (SOL) gut microbiome dataset to implement and train
machine learning models that can determine an individual’ s metabolic disorders based on their
gut microbiome.2. Literature review
We will be primarily be building of f of this study
Gut microbiome composition in the
Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Laftinos is shaped by geographic relocation,
environmental factors, and obesity - PubMed (nih.gov)
by Kaplan et al. in which they used the
SOL dataset and focused on observing the microbiome of immigrants that migrated at a young
age vs later stage in life and found key dif ferences in microbiome and obesity rates. Some of the
faults in the study are that there are no visualizations on model validation and model
performance scores. Although we will be focusing on metabolic disorders we hope to improve
on the paper by performing cross validation techniques to more robustly test our model
performances and provide clarity to how well our model performs.
For dimensional analysis of the feature table we utilized the study
Applications and
Comparison of Dimensionality Reduction Methods for Microbiome Data.
by Armstrong et al.
that discusses the key techniques of analyzing high-dimensional microbiome data and how
dimensionality reduction techniques can be applied. This study shines light on the special
characteristics of microbiome data and provides literature on previous successful studies,
together with the pitfalls and common mistakes to avoid. This paper provided a solid foundation
in understanding microbiome data for beginners in the field, in particular it introduced us to
beta-diversity analysis, PCoA, and UMAP  which are methods we will apply to our dataset.
To further study how dimensionality reduction techniques are used in the microbiome
field, we looked into the article
Uniform Manifold
Approximation and Projection (UMAP)
Reveals Composite Patterns and Resolves Visualization Artifacts in Microbiome Data
by
Armstrong, Geor ge et al. This article compares approaches of dimensionality reduction in
particular between PCoA  and UMAP  and the benefits and limitations of each method. The
visualizations in this article helped us understand the powers of each method, and gave us useful
recommendations for the selection of parameters. The article also showed us how we can utilize
Qiime2 to perform analyses of microbiome data which is helpful in our learning of Qiime2.
The literature
Human gut microbiome viewed across
age and geography
by Yatsunenko,
Tanya et al. is a study performed on a dataset that is similar to ours, in which there are many
geographic and demographic variables associated with the data. This study provided some useful
analyses techniques, in particular , we took interest in the Unifrac distance plots and the statistical
analyses techniques used in the study to pick out distinctive features in their dataset, and we plan
to incorporate these techniques into our analyses of the SOL  dataset.
3. Data Description
For the purposes of this project, we will be using the gut microbiome dataset collected by
the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). The HCHS/SOL  is apopulation-based study of about 16,000 self-identifying Hispanic/Latino adults from the ages of
18-74 who were selected from randomly sampled census block areas within Chicago, IL; Miami,
FL; Bronx, NY ; San Diego, CA  (
Lavange
, et al.
). The
study focused on gathering information on
the health status of the US Latino/Hispanic population in order to address the lack of research on
minorities.
For our project, we will be using 1835 self-collected stool samples that have gone
through 16S rRNA  gene amplicon sequencing and other bioinformatics preprocessing which is
explained more thoroughly in (
Kaplan, et al.
). The
dataset is available on Qiita
(
https://qiita.ucsd.edu/
) ID: 1 1666.
After collecting the data from Qiita, we were left with a single metadata table and a
single feature table. The feature table columns were OTU ID’ s that referenced the metadata and
the rows were genome sequences; each column in the table represents the counts of each
sequence in a particular sample. The metadata contained information about the participants
socioeconomic conditions, their country of origin, and their medical history which includes
information about whether or not a given sample had a certain metabolic disease. A subset of the
diseases will be selected as our classification tar gets and a few metadata columns such as age and
gender will be used as features in addition to the entire feature table of genome sequences.
As we will be focusing on investigating the relationship between the gut microbiome and
metabolic disorders, both tables will be extremely essential for building machine learning models
to predict whether or not someone has a given metabolic disease. Additionally , since our main
objective is to detect the presence, not severity , of diseases, the metabolic disease data is encoded
in a binary format which will lend itself to our purposes.
After dropping the samples with missing values and identifying the samples that existed
in both the feature table and metadata, we found 1750 samples that we could use for our analysis,
which is suf ficient for building our binary classification models.
We will then do some preprocessing on the amount of features (columns) of our feature
table. We plotted the count/frequency of samples that each feature appears on in our feature table
dataset. By looking at the ‘Frequency per Feature Analysis’  plot:
Frequency per  Featur e Analysiswe see that alot of our features have very low sample frequencies, which means that theres a lot
of irrelevant features/columns that have little importance and could be dropped in our data.
Summary of the Fr equencies Table
The above summary is calculated with the 1750 samples that were found post initial
preprocessing of the feature table.
Histogram of Number  of Samples & Fr equency Counts Per  Sample
Within the 1750 samples, we found that there were many samples that contained the
metabolic diseases that we want to investigate such as obesity , elevated blood pressure, diabetes
and dyslipidemia. We found the following disease counts present in the metadata. As we can see
in the graph below , pre-cvd had by far the lowest presence within our dataset, indicating that
there is a lar ge class imbalance within the pre-cvd column. This class imbalance will need to be
addressed in our pre-processing in order to prevent our model from overfitting.
After further data exploration, we found that many samples have varying amounts and
varying combinations of diseases, as can be seen in the graph below , which means a binary
classifier would not work. Though we considered using a regression model to predict the total
number of diseases per sample, we ultimately decided on exploring multi-label approaches that
could predict the specific diseases each sample has.
4. Methods
4.1 Data Preparation
The first step of our pipeline was to process the data and to prepare it for machine
learning development. For this step we primarily used Pandas to manipulate the metadata table.
The metadata was subsetted for only the diseases we wanted to study: obesity , diabetes,
dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease (ckd), pre-cardiovascular disease (pre-cvd), and elevated
blood pressure. Next, the control samples (marked by “BLANK”) and missing and null values
were dropped. Finally , the ckd and diabetes columns were mapped to binary values and all
metadata values were type casted to integers. Originally , the ckd and diabetes columns had a
range of values denoting the severity of the disease; mapping these values to binary keeps these
columns uniform with the other disease columns and simplifies our classification task by
reducing our values to 0, not having a specific disease, and 1, having a specific disease. The
feature table was also cleaned by setting a threshold value for minimum number of reads per
sequence and filtering out any sequences that did not exceed that threshold. Our threshold of
100,000 reads was heuristically determined by balancing the amount of information retained and
the speed at which our models could be trained and run.
From the summary visualizations and statistics that was explored in the Data Description
section, we see that most features only appear in less than 3 samples, therefore we are going to
drop the features that appear less than 3 times in order to reduce noise. We managed to reduce
57,241 features to 3,988 features, but only lost about 400,000 reads (23.8 million to 23.4 million
total frequency/reads), this will significantly speed up our downstream analysis process as well
as reduce the size and noise of our dataset.
As mentioned in the data description section, the pre-cvd column was imbalanced, there
were many more samples without pre-cvd than samples with pre-cvd, 1602 compared to 148
samples. As such we had to ensure that the classes within the pre-cvd column were balanced in
order to prevent our model from overfitting to the majority class. We did this by undersampling
and randomly selecting 148 negative samples. Although, we are losing data by undersampling
we do not risk overfitting our model on the majority class.
4.2 Features Analysis
A major goal of this project was to utilize
qiime2
to perform our analysis in order to
demonstrate its capabilities with the hopes of increasing adoption of the package in the
bioinformatics field. Qiime2 is extremely useful for microbiome analyses and provides a lot of
functionality for exploring microbiome diversity , performing dimensional analysis and creating
machine learning models, which is extremely useful for our project.
In order to understand our frequency table data and extract useful information to relate to
our metadata, we performed a dimensional analysis on our frequency feature table. We used the
Qiime2
core_metrics
method to perform a multitude
of dimensionality analysis techniques. The
first thing that we did is rarefy our table. Rarefying is a process of subsampling from all samples
so that the sum of frequencies in each sample is equal to the specified
sampling depth
and any
samples with frequency sum less than the sampling depth will not be included in the resulting
table. This process normalizes the data and assures that we don’ t have outliers in our dataset that
can skew our dimensionality analysis and ML  model. We still need to do further research on the
most optimal way to rarefy our table so that we do not make improper assumptions of our data
that could lead to invalid results of our project, for example, we do not want to lose too much
feature information in our data and drop too many/little samples that could af fect our findings
and credibility since dif ferent dimensionality reduction techniques yield visually and statistically
very dif ferent results on the same data.
With the rarified table, we extracted the distance matrices (with Jaccard, Bray-Curtis,
weighted and unweighted unifrac distance matrices) and created PCoA  matrices to reduce the
high-dimensional feature table to 2 and 3 dimensions. Distance matrices are useful as inputs for
further statistical analysis that we will perform to identify clustering or patterns in our
frequencies table and prove the significance of said findings. For example, we will be able to
demonstrate a separation between groups by performing beta-diversity analysis of the
distance/dissimilarity matrices and follow with a statistical validation with the PERMANOV A
(Permutational multivariate analysis of variance) test.
We also created plots of the PCoA  embedding matrix using Qiime2’ s Emperor plotting
library to visualize our data. We plan on using the new feature table in the low-dimension as an
input to our machine learning model. We also used another dimension reduction technique
Uniform Manifold Approximation & Projection (UMAP) on the data which has been proven
useful from previous successful literature (
Armstrong,
et al.
). Specifically , we are using a
supervised-UMAP  approach where we give the UMAP  algorithm our disease type label as
targets to perform supvervised clustering in the reduced 2D space. To do this supervised method,
we would need to filter our dataset to only include samples with a single disease type, and in
doing so reduced our dataset down to about 300 samples.
4.3 Modeling
Because our task involves determining which specific diseases a sample has, we took a
multi-label approach to building our machine learning model. A basic binary relevance model
was implemented as a baseline model. An independent binary classifier was created, trained, and
tuned for each class (disease), and each sample is then inputted into each classifier to see if that
sample has that particular disease or not.
To create our classifiers we used qiime2’ s
classify-samples
method, which implements
scikit-learn’ s
gradient boosting classifier
with log
loss, as the base model for each classifier . One
of the biggest advantages of using qiime2 over scikit-learn, is that it provides a lot more
information about the model such as model performance visualizations, feature importance and
probability tables by simply executing the classify-samples function. Additionally , it
automatically splits the data into training and test sets and utilizes stratified k-fold cross
validation to test the model.
While this binary relevance model is quick to implement and train, it assumes
independence between all of our classes, which is likely not true in our case. Studies have shown
diseases like obesity and diabetes are correlated, so finding a model that can account for such
relations would help the accuracy and scalability of our model to more and other diseases.We used the following params for the classify-samples method: {test_size = 0.3, cv = 10,
random_state = 100}. The
gradient boosting classifiers
used the default sklearn parameters with
a random_state=100.
5. Results
5.1 Dimensionality Reduction Results
For our first attempt at visualizations, we plotted PCoA  plots in the 3D space using a
variety of distance metrics for comparison, but found that clustering is dif ficult to see. We
believe this is caused because of varying amounts and varying combinations of diseases that
individuals/samples have, as previously mentioned in our metadata analysis.
Bray Curtis PCoA (Diabetes)
Jaccard PCoA (Diabetes)
Unweighted Unifrac Distance PCoA (Diabetes)
Weighted Unifrac Distance PCoA  (Diabetes)
We found significant clustering results in the 2D space using a Jaccard distance metric,
which signifies that further exploration of using this method could be useful for our classification
problem. However , since we have very limited sample size, and an imbalanced disease types
among samples, it is hard to utilize our finding as information/features for our classification
model.

The table above demonstrates the p-values of the PERMANOV A tests computed for each
disease type using unweighted and weighted UniFrac distance matrices. As we can see in the
table above, the majority of PERMANOV A tests computed had a p-value less than 0.05 which
means that the null hypothesis is rejected in those cases. This means that the observed
differences between those who had a given disease and those who did not, is likely not due to
chance alone and indicates that another factor/variable is leading to the dif ferences between both
groups (those with and those without a given disease). The only PERMANOV A tests that had a
p-value higher than .05 were both pre-cvd tests and the obesity test using the weighted UniFrac
distance matrix. We suspect that pre-cvd tests were likely af fected by the class balancing, which
resulted in a loss of information.
5.3 Binary Relevance Model Results
The plot above shows the performance of each individual gradient boosting binary
classification model within our binary relevance model. The plot contains the overall accuracy ,
the macro-average, and micro-average area under the curve (AUC’ s) for the model's receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The overall accuracy measured the proportion of samples
the model correctly predicted diseases for . The AUCs essentially measure our classifier ’s ability
to discriminate between positive and negative samples by measuring the true positive rate when
given a decision threshold. The macro-average AUC is calculated by calculating the AUC for
each class and then averaging the AUC overall the classes. The micro-average AUC is calculated
by averaging across each sample, which essentially means that it uses every sample prediction to
calculate the overall AUC.
As we can see by the results, the average overall accuracy of the models was about 60.9% and all
the AUC’ s are above 50% which means that every model performed better than random chance.
Obesity and diabetes were the best performing models with an accuracy of about 67% and 69%,
micro-average of about 70% and 73%, and macro-average of about 51% and 61%, respectively .
The big dif ference between micro and macro-average AUC’ s of the obesity model indicates that
the model performs better on the majority class than on the minority class, which indicates that
we may need to do more pre-processing to improve the results.
In addition to more pre-processing, it’ s possible that dif ferent choices of classifiers or
models could be implemented to improve our task performance. As seen in the PERMANOV A
test, there are significant and obvious dif ferences between the metabolic diseases when looking
at samples with only one disease. However , because the majority of our samples have multiple
diseases, it is reasonable to assume the microbiome features would look very dif ferently ,
requiring models or special inputs that recognize the how having multiple diseases can impact
the features and vice versa.
6. Discussion
Overall, we were unable to yield the desired results for our classification model. Due to
the dif ficulty of multi-label classification tasks, the complexity of microbiome and disease
research, and the lack of substantial data, the results yielded by our model has a lot of room for
improvement. The low accuracy of our model suggests a dif ferent multi-label machine learning
model, dif ferent choice of classifier model, or further data pre-processing may be required.
We attempted multiple methods to improve our model performance such as using
unweighted and weighted unifrac PCoA  results in our model training, but unfortunately it did not
improve upon our baseline performance. We suspect the biggest limitation to our project is the
lack of data and class imbalances within certain disease columns. Since we have 6 diseases we
are studying, we would need a minimum of 64 samples to have one of each possible combination
of diseases present. If we were to treat each combination as its own class and wanted 1,000
samples per class to train on, we would need a minimum of 64,000 unique samples.
Other models were also implemented to attempt to improve our classification
performance. One model was a modified multi-label K-nearest neighbors model. This model
looks at the distance of a sample’ s features to the features of other samples, and predicts labels
by looking at the weighted average of the closest 10 samples, or neighbors. Though this model
takes longer than the binary relevance model to train, there is only one classifier involved and
can easily be scaled with new data points and new diseases. However , this model performed even
worse than the binary relevance model, likely due to the lack of data and lar ge variance for each
class. Other distance metrics may need to be tested to see improvement in this model.Another tested model was a Multilayer Perceptron neural net with three fully connected
layers and a ReLU (rectified linear unit) activation layer using binary cross-entropy loss and
optimized with Adam optimizer (modified stochastic gradient descent). This is a significantly
more complex model than the knn model or binary relevance model, seeking to recognize any
patterns from scratch. Using a neural net enables actual multilabel prediction; the many nodes in
each fully connected layer allow for more nuanced weighting of dif ferent combinations of
features, and the final layer can be customized to output however many binary labels required.
Because of the complex nature of neural networks, they require enormous amounts of data, long
training times, and lots of tuning. Ultimately , the neural net did not perform very well, likely due
to our not having enough data.
While there remains other more complex models to test, a binary relevance model
follows the current state of medical testing; there is a separate, specific test for a specific disease
and sometimes multiple samples are required to conduct multiple tests. In this case, it makes
sense to continue using a binary relevance model and optimize the results. However , models like
the neural net that can weigh features and relationships between features against each other to
recognize varying patterns could very well be the next step in diagnostic fields.
Even though our project did not yield our desired results, our project still contributes to
the field of gut microbiome research by performing analysis with Python and commonly used
Python packages, lowering the barrier of entry for other data scientists and equipping current
researchers with new tools.

Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the issue of indoor air quality and safety to the
forefront of public attention. With the realization that respiratory aerosols can linger in indoor
spaces and potentially spread the virus, it has become imperative for individuals to have access
to accurate and ef fective tools for assessing indoor safety . While existing apps are available for
monitoring factors such as temperature and air quality , they do not consider the concentration of
respiratory aerosols or other contaminants that may be present in the indoor environment.
To address this crucial gap, our team is dedicated to developing a mobile application that
will leverage the built-in sensor data and machine learning models to simulate aerosol flow and
forecast the aerosol concentration in the surrounding area and enable users to assess the risk of
exposure to respiratory aerosols and other pollutants, providing them with valuable information
to make informed decisions about their safety .
The app is not limited to COVID-19, as it can be used for various other purposes and
illness. By processing the data we collected, our app can determine the safety of indoor
environments and provide valuable insights to the quality of air .
IntroductionIn order to inform, manage, and minimize risk factors related to airborne infections and
other pollutants, we want to develop simulated digital twins of physical systems that model
indoor air quality while monitoring risk related to human respiratory droplets and aerosols. That
is, we are working on developing a compartment model of aerosol concentration and flow in the
presence of dynamic human syndromic events. In addition to respiratory aerosols, other
contaminants that may pose health hazards are to be taken into account (Rahman 1).
The installation of sensor -based systems that provide information on airborne virus and
other pollution risk factors is dif ficult due to a number of issues, and one of them is the absence
of sensor equipment for general use. Currently available devices are made for specific
application situations, and their high cost makes their use prohibitively expensive in many
general use scenarios. One way to approach the problem is that we can employ computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) to provide information on the operation of indoor environments and the
flow of air , but it’ s difficult to set up without the right domain knowledge for many situations and
demand a lot of computing resources (Rahman 1). Therefore, our smartphone app could
effectively resolve the cost problems and computing dif ficulties and provide the results
accurately .
This project is divided into three stages: data collection, data visualization, and modeling
and simulation.  In the first stage, we created an iOS application that includes features such as
thermal images, audio, and room layout capturing. To test the app and collect data,
we set up a
testbed in a small of fice room where we simulated human coughs mechanically and captured
aerosol concentration using a particulate matter (PM) sensor . The cough simulation involved
using a mannequin, mechanical ventilator , fog machine and air compressor ,
and we experimented
u
nder dif ferent room conditions like fan speed, door
opening control, etc. In the second stages,we plotted the esplased time and aerosol concentration for several experiments under dif ferent
room settings and discovered that the
air exchange
rate is a crucial factor in determining the
resident time of aerosol. In the final stage, we used compartment models to forecast aerosol
concentration, and
Ansys Discovery software to simulate
the aerosol flow . We used our
experiment data to validate the performance of these performances. Overall, this project aims to
provide a reliable and ef fective solution to the challenges of indoor air quality monitoring and
risk mitigation, especially in the context of public health and safety .
Methods
Data Collection App and Tools
Our team developed an iOS application for data collection and proof-of-concept
deployment of models.
The app is equipped with various
features, including capturing audio and
classifying dif ferent sounds, with a focus on capturing
human respiratory
events such as cough
sneezing while excluding speech to ensure privacy .
It also captures thermal images using a FLIR
one camera to detect human
presence, movement, and
surface temperature
in the thermal images
using YOLO model, and room layout and geometry using Lidar and camera, which are essential
information for modeling and CFD simulation .
We stored
the collected data online using
Firebase and fetched data for further analysis.
To support data collection, we used the SPS30 Particulate Matter Sensor to measure our
ground truth aerosol concentration. We created a graph outlining our methods for a clearer
understanding.Figure 1: flowchart that describes the app that were created
Data Collection Pr ocess

Experiment Room
To ensure proper experimental conditions indoors, certain rules must be followed when
selecting the indoor environment. The designated space for data must be followed when selecting
an indoor environment. The room we chose is a compact of fice room with a dimension of
approximately 3.2m x 2.6m x 3.2 m, and there was a desk and three chairs displayed in the room.
2.
Set-up and Experiment
In order to collect data, the process involves simulating cough events and using mobile
and particulate matter (PM) sensors to capture the data from these events. The fog machine and
the mechanical ventilator were used as the cough simulator , and the mechanical ventilator emits
a high-velocity air flow , which disperses the fog (aerosol) into the room. Both are placed on the
desk in the room.
An example of the room display , sensor placements, and  cough machines are shown
below:

Figure [a] and [b]: picture of a part of the room (with cough simulators) and tripod is placed in front of mannequin
The aerosol release events are simulated five times for each room condition, taking into
the factors such as furniture placement, door and window openings, and air conditioning status.
These simulations are conducted in a steady environment, with three to five minute intervals
between each event to capture aerosol dispersion data. The ventilator button is manually pressed
to trigger the events, and the fog machine is set to operate continuously with a five minute
interval. To ensure accurate results, a human experimenter must be present in the room during
the experiment for pressing the button.
To set up CFD Simulators, it’ s necessary to define the surface types and the temperatures.
Our data collection app is designed to capture the rooms’  thermal images using the
smartphone-compatible thermal camera (FLIR One). Here’ s some examples:

Figure 4: thermal images of mannequin (cough machine)
Data Preprocessing
1.
Fetch Data from Firebase
After we collected data, the first step was to retrieve the required data from Firebase,
where we had stored thermal images and audio. To automate the process, we developed a script
that could download the data seamlessly .
2.
Data Integration and Sensor  Data Mapping
To mer ge the data from the six sensors, we developed a script that sorted the data based
on their timestamp and matched the sensor location with their respective sensor ID. This ensured
that the data was integrated accurately and could be used for further analysis.
Data visualizations
Graphs and description
We first conducted experiments at four dif ferent fan speed settings - low speed, medium
speed, high speed, and no AC. We plotted the mass concentration levels from six dif ferent sensor
positions over a 200-second period and observed that the dispersion and duration of aerosol
concentrations varied across dif ferent fan speed settings and sensor locations during a cough
event.Figure 5: PM 2.5 Sensors at different locations and the corresponding elapsed time’s mass concentrations
To better illustrate these dif ferences, we used a log scale graph and an aerosol
concentration at exhaust location graph for compariso
n.
Our findings indicated that in the
absence of air conditioning, aerosols tend to persist in a room for a longer time and disperse at a
slower rate than when the fan is turned on. Additionally , under high-speed fan settings, the
aerosol concentration was lower and dispersed faster than under low-speed settings. These
observations suggest that the air exchange rate in the room plays a critical role in the changes in
aerosol concentration.
Figure 6: corresponding elapsed time’s mass concentrations
Along with experiments conducted under dif ferent fan speed settings, we explored the
impact of room conditions on aerosol dispersion during a cough event. Three dif ferent room
conditions were tested: leaving the door open, keeping the door closed, and closing the door
during the cough event and opening it afterward.
Our analysis revealed that air flow plays a critical role in the changes in aerosol
concentration. When the door was open, the aerosol concentration was significantly lower than
when the door was closed, indicating that the exchange of air with the surrounding environment
can help reduce aerosol concentration in the room. Conversely , the resident time for aerosols was
longer in enclosed environments.
Figure 7: concentration measured for aerosol concentration in different room condition for time elapse
These observations highlight the importance of considering room conditions, such as
ventilation and air flow , when developing models to forecast aerosol concentration in dif ferent
settings. By taking into account the influence of room conditions, we can develop more accurate
models and better understand the factors af fecting aerosol dispersion.
Modeling and Simulation
1.
Compartment model
To forecast aerosol concentration, we utilized two compartment models with one
sub-compartment. We solved the equation of aerosol concentration in both the perfectly mixed
parent compartment (
) and subcompartment
over time. However , for the sake of simplicity ,𝐶𝑝𝐶𝑠
we neglected the sinks (settling) factor and focused solely on the aerosol concentration in the
parent compartment.

Softwar e Simulation
Based on the mentor ’s advice, we looked into various
third-party software that is capable
of performing computational fluid dynamics. The primary objective of using such software is to
cross-validate the data collected from the particulate matter sensors (PM sensor) as well as
potentially generating extra data for model training purposes. The software that we eventually
decided to use is Ansys Discovery because it is relatively easy to configure, and the simulation
result is quite straightforward. The diagram below shows a very basic simulated scene where one
air vent is set up on one side of the wall (represented by the small square at the origin of the air
flows) and the aerosol movement across the surfaces of the room. The scene gives our group
some expectation of the software’ s capabilities. Based on its ability to reflect fluid dynamics in
an enclosed environment, the software could also provide guidance on where to place the PM
sensors for more accurate readings during data collection.
Figure 9: simulated scene
After getting used to the software, we tested the compatibility between the environment
information collected from LiDAR and the modeling feature in the software. It turned out that by
scanning around the room, the resulting model can be imported into Ansys Discovery directly ,
which saves the trouble of constructing the room from scratch. The scanned model is nearly
perfect, despite the tessellation levels being slightly too high. To prepare the models, Ansys
SpaceClaim is used to mer ge independent surfaces into solids and remove extra edges. The
repaired geometry is shown in the figure below .
Figure 10: example of a prepared geometry (UC 302)
Figure 11: general airflow simulation
After some trial and error , we were able to replace the original walls with an abstract
enclosure (filled with air) around the furniture in the room and assess the possible airflows in the
room. From the figure above, it is obvious that when a series of normal airflow currents goes
through the enclosed space from one side to the other , the air current is disrupted by the other
side of the room as well as the furniture. As a result, the airflows form vortexes in which aerosols
would be hanging around, increasing aerosol concentration temporarily in parts of the enclosed
environment. The simulation serves as an extra data source for the group to verify that the sensor
setups are correctly capturing the minute dif ferences at various spots.
However , due to our limited knowledge of computational fluid dynamics, some
parameters such as surface heat convection and boundary conditions still need further work and
improvements before performing high-fidelity coughing simulations. The group has also been
consulting  Dr . Andres Tejada, a professional in CFD simulation from USF , to continue making
progress over this topic. As of right now , the software simulation is a great baseline to visualize
the possible airflow conditions in the room and validate our data collection process.

After researching common air exchange rates for
different room settings (as listed on The Engineering Toolbox website) and conducting multiple
trials and errors on the coef ficient, we were able to determine the best-fit model with varying

Conclusion / Discussion
For this Capstone project, we developed models using measured sensor data and
simulation data to develop robust models to predict aerosol resident time, and also performed
experiments on human subjects to improve the model’ s accuracy in incorporating sound labels
and subject movement. As for the graph part, we need a better way to determine the value of
alpha and the air exchange rate instead of manually tuning parameters in the future.

1 Abstract
The current COVID-19 pandemic and common flu highlight the importance of time-
sensitive information in biomedical institutions, politics, and economics. The application
of data science in creating real-time predictive models is crucial to help researchers and
world leaders better understand disease spread and take preventative measures. Our
project aims to optimize the DeepGLEAM model, a deep learning and stochastic process-
based predictive model, by better processing raw data and simulating it for improved
flu case predictions in the United States. We close the gap in missing data in the Deep-
GLEAM model by researching interpolation and imputation techniques to enhance the
model’s predictions. The performance of our adjusted model will be compared against a
control model for effectiveness.
2 Introduction
Due to the current state of affairs, the importance of time-sensitive information, espe-
cially regarding the livelihood and health of countries across the world has come to the
forefront of biomedical institutions, as well as in politics and economics. Data science,
in its essence, derives necessary analysis and insights amalgamated from computational
programming, as well as a fundamental understanding of statistics and decision-making
on a technical level. Consequently, data science is crucial in its application in a vast array
of fields and issues, including the current COVID-19 endemic and the common flu, being
able to create real-time predictive models that would enable researchers and world lead-
ers to be more aware of the spread and preemptive measures against disease. Therefore,
within our project proposal for Winter Quarter 2023, we aim to fully grasp the mechan-
ics of Professor Yian-Ma and Professor Yu’s DeepGLEAM model and further optimize its
ability to merge simulated and ground truth data so it better predicts future cases of fluDSC 180B Project Report
cases within the United States.
Deep learning and stochastic processes can be very effective in better understanding
and forecasting future events relevant to our society, one of which is the recent endemic
COVID-19, as well as the common flu. The concept of predictive distributions through
previous truths and predicting with a relative uncertainty projected into the future is quite
compelling, for it applies spatiotemporal insights through quantifiable evidence within
code, such as residuals. Because disease is constantly changing, mutating, and affect-
ing across state fronts, weekly data predictions are not only necessary but cumulative in
providing cognizance in how illness can permeate and any patterns we as data scientists
can derive from the perpetual change. Our task mainly lies in how we are able to better
process the provided raw data and simulate it so that the forecasting of cases align more
closely with future predictions.
The issue with missing data is more inaccurate predictions and its proclivity to increas-
ing uncertainty in predictions. In order to provide our personal contribution towards the
already functional DeepGLEAM model, we as a team have researched how to possibly 1)
interpolate missing data through a feed-forward system, 2) understand the weight vec-
tors of hyperparameters when splitting the model, and 3) considering other possibilities
of imputing the missing data, simply due to most states lacking at least a couple weeks of
information from the original shape provided within the flu data file. We aim to take the
baseline replication of the DeepGLEAM model from Quarter 1, train individual models
per each state’s data without tampering with any of it, altering the data through interpo-
lation and imputation, and finally juxtapose the results of the adjusted model’s ability to
predict future cases against the control model.
3 Methods - Experiment Design
For flu forecasting, we used DSMLP (UC San Diego’s Data Science/Machine Learning
Platform) for training and testing models. In the case of forecasting without interpola-
tion, the limited availability of GLEAM simulation data resulted in a 0.67:0.33 split be-
tween the training, validation, and testing sets. Meanwhile, in the case of forecasting
with interpolation, a 50:50 split was utilized between the training, validation, and testing
sets. For interpolation, we tried randomly selecting a portion of the real data and fill in the
gaps in the dataset. We utilized 1000 epochs and a batch-size of 6 for forecasting without
interpolation and 1000 epochs and a batch-size of 11 for forecasting with interpolation.
The ADAM optimizer was utilized with a learning rate of 1e−2for both cases, and early
stopping was implemented to prevent over-training. The input sequential length for the
DeepGLEAM Flu model was 1.
2DSC 180B Project Report
For both the Exponential Smoothing (ETS) algorithm and the Auto Regressive Integrated
Moving Average (ARIMA) model, we utilized CDC flu ground truth data after 2020-10-
10. The parameters for each state were optimized based on grid search results to improve
performance.
We also adopted a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model to tackle the flu forecasting prob-
lem, training on normalized data separately for each state. The MLP model was designed
with three hidden layers, an input length of 6, an output length of 4, and a hidden layer
length of 256. To optimize the model, we employed the Adam optimizer with a learning
rate of 0.001, along with a stepwise learning rate decay using the StepLR scheduler. As
the loss function, we chose the mean squared loss function. The training process was car-
ried out for a total of 300 epochs, with the training loss and validation loss being reported
every 10 epochs. The optimal model was selected based on the lowest validation loss
achieved during the training process.
For the combined method, we integrated both the MLP and DeepGLEAM approaches. In
the individual MLP , the model was initialized with an input length of 6, an output length
of 1, and a hidden layer length of 128. A distinct predictive model was developed for
each week, leveraging information from the preceding 6 weeks.
This methodology provides a comprehensive and robust approach to solving the flu fore-
casting problem, incorporating both MLP and DeepGLEAM techniques to enhance the ac-
curacy and reliability of the predictions. By adopting a systematic training process and re-
fining the model based on validation loss, we ensure the selection of the best-performing
model for the task at hand.
4 Methods - Experiment Results
Based on the results depicted in Figure 1, it is evident that the GLEAM prediction dataset
presents a significant gap in the records from June 2022 to November 2022. However, after
performing interpolation on the dataset, as presented in Figure 2, we were able to impute
the trend of flu cases and include an additional five months of data into the available
dataset for DeepGLEAM. The improved performance of DeepGLEAM post-interpolation
is demonstrated in Table 1, where an average MAE improvement of about 4 is observed.
The percentage improvement in MAE when using the Quantile model with GLEAM inter-
polation compared to the Quantile model without interpolation is approximately 11.85%.
Therefore, the utilization of interpolation techniques in this study has not only enhanced
the accuracy of the DeepGLEAM model but has also allowed for the inclusion of addi-
tional data points, thereby strengthening the reliability of the predictions.

Based on the findings presented in Table 2, when the prediction is shifted leftward by 2
weeks (indicated by *), there is an improvement in the model’s performance. Specifically,
for a one-week-ahead prediction, the MAE is reduced from 20.66 to 17.00, and for a two-
week-ahead prediction, the MAE decreases from 23.37 to 22.27. This improvement can
be attributed to the delayed nature of the data provided, as shifting the prediction left-
wards helps mitigate the effect of data delay. By doing so, the model is better equipped to
provide more reliable and accurate predictions, ultimately enhancing its overall perfor-
mance. The table demonstrates that incorporating a 2-week leftward shift in the Autore-
gressive Multi-Layer Perceptron model leads to improvements in flu forecasting accuracy,
as evidenced by the reduced MAE values.

As shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4, the performance of time-series forecasting models,
such as ETS and ARIMA, are impacted by a lack of trend and limited data points. In the
absence of a clear trend, these models struggle to capture the underlying patterns and
produce reliable predictions. Additionally, with limited data points, the models do not
have enough information to identify and account for seasonality or other factors that can
influence the outcome being predicted. As a result, the performance of ETS and ARIMA
models suffer under these conditions, highlighting the importance of having a sufficient
amount of high-quality data when using these methods for time-series forecasting.

Table 3 presents a comparison of the performance of various methods for time series
forecasting, and it is evident that the combined MLP and DeepGLEAM approach out-
performs all other methods, demonstrating a significant lead in MAE error. This result
is a testament to the effectiveness of combining multiple techniques to enhance the accu-
racy and reliability of time series forecasting models. The success of this approach can
be attributed to the complementary strengths of MLP and DeepGLEAM, which when
combined, are capable of capturing a wider range of patterns and relationships within
the data. Ultimately, the superior performance of the combined MLP and DeepGLEAM
approach underscores the importance of leveraging multiple methods and techniques to
produce more accurate and reliable predictions in time series forecasting.

superior performance in the long term, particularly within the 3-4 week range. The gray
area in the graph represents the 95 percent confidence interval and provides an indication
of the level of uncertainty associated with the predictions. The results of this study under-
score the importance of selecting the appropriate model for the specific time frame being

on the time horizon being considered.

5 Conclusion
Upon transitioning from multiple approaches of interpolation, ranging from simple pan-
das libraries to more advanced neural networks, we have come to realize that the Multi-
Layer Perceptron (MLP) merged with DeepGLEAM provides the best model performance,
even outperforming the default model provided in the GLEAM research paper.
Some further steps we would like to consider is the possibility of cross-validating this
new merged model back to the COVID-19 dataset, among other endemic and pandemic
time-sensitive information. We also would like to consider the Bayesian Information Cri-
terion, as opposed to the Akaike Information Criterion provided in the paper, due to the
tendency for most of the models to be Bayesian. Additionally, we can re-evaluate our
standard of metric to more than simply MAE, because although Mean Average Error is
holistic, it might not be as comprehensive as other metrics. We would also be interested in
exploring more complex neural networks, beyond the Multilayer Perceptron, in hopes of
further optimizing the DeepGLEAM model. Possibly creating a more thorough dataset,
with more data points, could aid in the process of improving model performance with a
bigger pool for model training and validating.
We believe that our results and purpose within this capstone project is impactful for the
future of deep learning in the healthcare industry, and we hope to find more progress
through further exploration of time-series data.

Abstract
Simulations in different fields such as epidemiology use models that can learn com-
plex systems very accurately, with immense processing power and huge amounts
of storage. One way to train a model that efficiently learns complex systems is
by designing a model such that it can learn from different fidelities. Multi-fidelity
models train neural processes on multi-fidelity datasets and sample a range of
predictions while achieving cheaper simulation costs and better predictions. To
improve on performance, this paper utilizes a technique called active learning.
Active learning determines which training data to train on next via a reward func-
tion, further improving training convergence and stability. This paper explores the
possibilities of extending active learning to multi-fidelity neural processes in order
to improve accuracy, training time, and simulation cost.
1 Introduction
Computational models often characterize the relationship of physical systems in various scientific
applications. In these systems, the input typically represents numerous different properties, while
outputs of these systems represent the desired values and outcomes. In epidemiology, we utilize
computational models to do forecasting of outbreaks of different viruses and outbreaks [1][2]. With
regards to COVID-19, the inputs of these models [4] are including but not limited to, transmissibility,
and contact rates. The outputs of these models describe the outcomes based on the aforementioned
factors, such as predictions and forecasts.
Specifically, computational models in machine learning, are simulated in two different ways- low-
fidelity and high-fidelity models. Low-fidelity models are cheaper with regards to cost, and pay
the price with respect to [lower] accuracy. Alternatively, high-fidelity models produce outputs with
higher accuracy, while also taking on higher costs.
Multi-fidelity models work with this trade off by combining outputs at various fidelity levels in order
to speed up the time taken to learn. In doing so, we can gain accuracy predictions and insights that
high-fidelity models would normally provide while having costs of low-fidelity models, improving
the cost-accuracy tradeoff. In the simulation and multi-fidelity modeling space, there have been two
types of processes utilized to tackle a plethora of problems- Gaussian processes and Neural Processes.
Gaussian processes
Gaussian processes are models that define probability distributions over various functions; they are
data efficient and flexible but they are computationally intensive [5]. Neural processes improve on
Gaussian processes by adapting the priors to data, and thus improve model accuracy and reduce
computation [6]. The downside of Gaussians is that they take a performance hit when it comes to
high-dimensional data, which is a major issue when it comes to machine learning, specifically deep
learning.With the introduction of multi-fidelity hierarchical neural processes [8], neural processes can now
be designed for and handle multi-fidelity data and outputs. This work also provides flexibility to
combine data with varying dimensions, and specifically tailors to applications like climate modeling
and epidemiology.
In this work, we combine active learning with the existing multi-fidelity hierarchical neural processes
framework; the contributions are as follows:
•A variant of multi-fidelity hierarchical neural processes (MF-HNP), which uses acqui-
sition functions, namely, maximum mean standard deviation (MEAN-STD) to improve
performance.
•Real-world multi-fidelity application showing the use case for the utilization of active
learning with regards to deep learning, specifically, for epidemiology modeling.
The code and data are available on https:/github.com/apatankar22/hier-neural-proc.
2 Related Work
Multi-fidelity modeling is a modeling strategy that has been used in various fields frequently, and
works in the past have used gaussian processes at various different fidelity levels for a deep learning
application [7]. Moreover, [8] includes disjoint data sets at low- and high-fidelity levels, which acts
as a failure case for multi-fidelity Gaussian processes (NARGP), proposed in [9]. Moreover, deep
gaussian processes introduced in [10] attempt to optimize parameters at fidelity levels jointly. With
regards to different process types, [11] gives an alternative for gaussian processes by modeling using
neural processes. But, the work done for that paper is unable to incorporate multi-fidelity data; the
work done by [8] is able to do just that. [12] is an example where deep active learning has been used,
but the application of this technique was image classification; the task at hand in this work is time
series modeling. A similar technique is used in [13], where the task is natural language processing.
3 Background
3.1 Multi-Fidelity Modeling
With regards to modeling in a probabilistic setting, a model is defined as a function f; with an input
domain X⊆Rdxand output domain Y ⊆Rdy, then f:X→ Y . When utilizing models like f,
we are presented with computational costs that are greater than zero. These computational costs
increase as we get to higher fidelities, and so, we are often limited with respect to high-fidelity
data, especially as training data. When modeling in a multi-fidelity setting, we have functions
{f1,···, fK}representing the costs of various ffunctions with their own individual accuracies
and computational costs. Using multi-fidelity hierarchical modeling, we combine information from
low-fidelity and high-fidelity models.
In this paper’s work, we deal with epidemiology modeling, and we have data that corresponds to
epidemic trajectories. In doing so, at a particular fidelity, we have xkas our parameters; for a given
scenario k, our data is as follows: Dk≡n
xk,i,[yk,i]S
s=1o
i. In this given scenario, [yk,i]S
s=1areS
samples generated by fk(xk,i)for scenario i. When applying this to epidemiology modeling in this
paper, a scenario and corresponding data generates time series forecasting of daily infections using
the model at hand.
2The model used in this paper is a deep surrogate model approximating the data distribution at the
highest fidelity level, given context sets at various fidelities and the corresponding input values.
Having Dhas our high-fidelity data, and Dlas our low-fidelity data, we know that Dh⊂ D l, and
because of this, the data domain Xhas a ""nested structure"". If Dh=Dlwe say the low- and
high-fidelity data sets are ""paired"". The low and high fidelity data are split into context and target sets
as follows:

3.2 Neural Processes
Neural processes [6] are a family of conditional latent variable models for implicit stochastic processes,
and produce somewhere between gaussian processes and neural networks. Neural processes are able
to represent distributions over functions while also scale to higher dimensions, giving them an edge
over gaussian processes. Using the Kolmogorov Extension Theorem [14], neural processes meet
exchangeability and consistency conditions to define SPs.
Organically, neural processes’ local latent variables zandθare included and are trained using context
sets and target sets. These sets are as follows:

34 Methodology
In this section, I introduce the acquisition functions used in conjuniction with the Multi-fidelity
Hierarchical Neural Processes (MF-HNP) [8] framework.
4.1 Acquisition Functions
4.1.1 Low-level Mean
Using the mean of low-level mean of latent variables is an approach that is used to infer zh. For every
parameter θ, you generate a set of predictions {ˆx1:T}by sampling multiple z1:T. So, for a given
subset of Tdata, with Ddimensions in each data point, we compute the mean of µzlfor a given time
step (in our case, days) tand feature/attribute d. The calculation is as follows: µ=1
TD*PT
t=1*PD
d=1*Pµt,dfor each parameter θ, and the parameter θwith the highest µis selected.
4.1.2 Maximum Mean Standard Deviation
Maximum Mean Standard Deviation [12] is originally an approach that is used to estimate the model
uncertainty, and to infer zh, given µzlandσ2
zl. For each parameter θ, you generate a set of predictions
{ˆx1:T}by sampling multiple z1:T. So, for a given subset of Tdata, with Ddimensions in each
data point, we compute the standard deviation of σt,dfor a given time step (in our case, days) tand
feature/attribute d. Maximum Mean Standard Deviation (MEAN-STD) calculates σ=1
TD*PT
t=1*PD
d=1*Pσt,dfor each parameter θ, and the parameter θwith the highest σis selected.
4.2 Multi-fidelity Hierarchical Neural Processes
Multi-fidelity Hierarchical Neural Processes is a framework introduced by Wu et al (2022) that
utilizes Bayesian latent variable model’s properties, simultaneously learning the joint distribution of
multi-fidelity output.
Figure 1: Graphical models for Single-Fidelity Neural Process (left), Multi-Fidelity Neural Process
(middle), Multi-Fidelity Hierarchical Neural Process (right). Shaded circles denote observed
variables and hollow circle represent latent variables. The directed edges represent conditional
dependence.
As the figure shows, single fidelity neural processes (extreme left) work on the assumption that
high-fidelity data is independent of the low-fidelity data. Multi-fidelity hierarchical neural processes
(extreme right) assigns latent variables zlandzhat each respective fidelity level, with the prior of zh
is conditioned on zl.
The MFHNP framework ensures that the model outputs at the respective fidelity levels are condi-
tionally independent given the corresponding latent state [8]. Hence, correlations between fidelity
levels are transformed to the latent space. Specifically, with vanilla multi-fidelity neural processes,
ˆyhdepends on (xh, yl)input pairs given z, while in MFHNP, ˆyhonly depends on input xhgiven zh.
4.3 Scalable Training
As we use the same framework used by [8], the distributions are the same, and are as follows:

5 Experiments
5Figure 2: AS-SIR Modeling Framework: High-fidelity population-level contact matrices are
generated using macro (census) and micro (survey) data [28]. Low-fidelity contact matrices are
obtained by grouping individuals in fewer age brackets. Distinct age-stratified SIR models are used
to simulate the epidemic at the two fidelity levels.
The performance of different active learning methods using the MFHNP framework are
measured on stochastic epidemiology modeling (age-stratified). Figure 2 shows the modeling
technique(s) that was also used in [8], as we use the same framework for this project.
5.1 Experiment Setup
For all experiments, the MF-HNP models with different acquisition functions (MEAN, MEAN-STD)
are compared to the NARGP, SFGP, SFNP, and MFHNP baselines.
•The Gaussian Process (GP) baselines are the nonlinear auto-regressive multi-fidelity GP
regression model (NARGP) [9] and single-fidelity Gaussian Processes (SFGP) model (under
assumption of data independence at respective fidelity).
•The Neural Process (NP) baselines are the single-fidelity Neural Processes (SF-NP) from
[15] and the multi-fidelity Hierarchical Neural Processes (MFHNP) [8].
For all neural process models, the context aggregation method used is mean context aggregation
(MA), which generates latent variable zat each fidelity level. However, the NARGP baseline only
works for nested data. Regarding model metrics, mean absolute error (MAE) is used for accuracy, and
mean negative log likelihood (NLL) is used for uncertainty estimation. For age-stratified Susceptible-
Infectious-Recovered (AS-SIR) experiment, we calculate NLL for AS-SIR experiment in the log
space, and based on the Gaussian distribution. MAE is calculated in the original space, using the
mean predictions and the truth.
5.2 Age-Stratified SIR Compartmental Model
We utilize the same age-stratified Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (AS-SIR) epidemic model as [8]:
˙Si=−λiSi,˙Ii=λiSi−γIi,˙Ri=γIi
Si, Ii, andRirepresent the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered age iindividuals. Identical
to [8], The age-specific ""force"" of infection is defined by λi:
λi=βX
jMi,jIj
Nj,
βrepresents the transmissibility rate of the infection, Njrepresents the total number of individuals of
agej, and Mi,jrepresents the overall age-stratified contact matrices describing the average number
of contacts with individuals of age jfor an individual of age i[8].
The active learning variants are built upon the same assumptions as the original MFHNP model:
heterogeneous mixing of age groups to realistically capture the social mixing differences existing
between various regions of the world [8].
Dataset. As per [8], there are exactly 109 scenarios from different locations in China, the United
States, and Europe. The data in China, USA, and Europe is at the province, state, and country level,
respectively. For each scenario, we generate 30 samples for 100 day’s new infection prediction at low-
and high-fidelity levels based on the corresponding initial conditions, R0, age-stratified population,
and the overall age-stratified contact matrices [8]. The high-fidelity data, as shown in Figure 2, has
85 age groups. As such, the age-stratified contact matrices Mh,ijis of dimension 85×85. For
low-fidelity data, the data obtained contains 18 age groups, resulting in a contact matrix Ml,ijof
dimension 18×18. All training, validation, and testing sets are conducted in the same manner as [8];
31, 26, and 52 random scenarios at both fidelities, respectively.
Performance Analysis. Table 2 compares the prediction performance for both Gaussian Process
(mean aggregation) methods and five MFHNP methods for daily infection forecasting over 100 days,
6with performance is reported in MAE and NLL. MF-HNP(MEAN-STD) has the best performance
with respect to MAE for nested data structure, meaning that using MEAN-STD as an acquisition
function for active learning is fairly viable. As expected, both NARGP and SFGP underperform.
Table 2: Comparison of average performance of various processes on Age-Stratified SIR data sets.
7Figure 3: 100 days ahead infectious incidence compartment forecasting of randomly selected scenario
at each row, analyzed in 4 age groups. Natural logscale for yaxis.
Figure 3 shows the predictions of a randomly selected scenario in the nested dataset. It shows the
truth, the SFNP and MFHNP predictions, as well as the MEAN-STD-MFHNP together with four age
groups (10,30,50,70). In this experiment, the best neural process is MEAN-STD-MFHNP; while
MEAN-STD-MFHNP has the best NLL score, studying its predictions across much more data reveals
that the predictions made by the MEAN-STD acquisition function are rather conservative, and tend
to fall in a larger band (i.e. larger confidence interval).
6 Conclusion and Limitation
In this paper, we show that using MEAN-STD [and to some extent, MEAN] is a viable approach
to implementing active learning on top of the MFHNP framework. Applying these active learning
methods to this framework is more accurate and efficient as compared to the standalone existing
MFHNP framework as well as other neural and gaussian process approaches. Specifically, it utilizes
these acquisition functions to score the data and invariably require less data to train on, while also
supporting varying input and output dimensions at different fidelity levels (as per [8]). This report
demonstrates the success of the aforementioned active learning methods on a large-scale time series
application: age-stratified epidemiology modeling, an area that is highly prevalent nowadays.
Regarding future work, the next steps would be to utilize other acquisition functions, such as expected
information gain (EIG), which is also known as Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement, BALD,
or maximum entropy. We could parameterize each feature using the mean and standard deviation
in order to use EIG, or Regarding future work, the next steps would be to utilize other acquisition
functions, such as expected information gain (EIG), which is also known as Bayesian Active Learning
by Disagreement (BALD). We could parameterize each feature using the mean and standard deviation
in order to use EIG. Another option would be to use maximum entropy as an acquisition function.

The authors propose a variant of multi-fidelity hierarchical neural processes (MF-HNP) that incorporates acquisition functions to improve performance. They demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in a real-world multi-fidelity application for epidemiology modeling. The results show that the MF-HNP with the MEAN-STD acquisition function performs the best in terms of accuracy and uncertainty estimation compared to other neural and Gaussian process models.

An investigation into the bias behind the popular image-generation model
James Dai, Moses Oh, Tyler Tran, Costin Smilovici, V edan Desai
Abstract
DALL-E
2
is
a
model
that
processes
natural
language
and
returns
a
corresponding
image
or
set
of
images.
This
model
has,
in
the
past
two
years,
come
under
increasing
scrutiny
due
to
its
biased
results
wherein
certain
genders
or
races
are
displayed
more,
often
significantly
more,
than
others.
In
July
of
2022,
OpenAI,
the
publishers
of
DALL-E
2,
revealed
that
they
had
worked
on
methods
to
mitigate
this
bias
that
had
resulted
in
a
marked,
visible
improvement
in
the
generated
images.
This
is
the
claim
that
was
tested
over
the
course
of
this
investigation;
is
DALL-E
2
still
biased
in
terms
of
gender
and
occupation?
In
other
words,
are
the
image
sets
generated
by
the
algorithm
relatively
balanced?
In
order
to
test
this
claim,
ten
professions
were
selected
from
the
Bureau
of
Labor
Statistics’
listing
of
occupations
in
the
United
States.
Half
of
the
professions
were
selected
as
slightly
male
dominated
(over
50%
of
the
gender
make
up
for
the
job
was
male),
while
the
other
half
were
selected
as
slightly
female
dominated.
Upon
testing
these
inputs
through
DALL-E
2
and
tagging
the
resulting
images
as
either
male-presenting
or
female-presenting,
it
was
found
that,
if
not
the
model
itself,
the
DALL-E
2
API
is still extremely biased at least across the axes of gender and occupation.
Keywords:
DALL-E 2, gender bias, algorithmic fairness,
machine learning
Introduction
Machine
learning
is
used
for
a
variety
of
purposes
in
our
society
today;
healthcare,
business
analytics,
correctional
systems,
scientific
exploration,
and
even
in
seemingly
mild
and
light
hearted
applications
that
have
achieved
widespread
commercial
and
critical
success.
One
of
these
applications
is
the
image
generating
model
known
colloquially
as
‘DALL-E
2’,
a
software
that
receives
prompts
in
the
form
of
natural
language
and
outputs
its
own
perception
of
what
the
user
wants
to
see.
At
first
glance
this
seems
relatively
harmless.
However ,
as
other
investigations
have
demonstrated,
this
is
clearly not the case.
DALL-E
2
has
recently
come
under
fire
for
the
racial
and
gender
make-up
of
its
outputs
when
given
specific
prompts.
This
criticism
was
addressed
in
2022
by
OpenAI
in
their
blog
post
titled
‘Reducing
Bias
and
Improving
Safety
in
DALL-E
2’.
As
such,
the
bias
inherent
in
the
algorithm
is
a
problem,
and
one
that
OpenAI
has
apparently
been
working
to
address.
This
report
investigates
just
how
far
the
team
at
OpenAI
has
come
in
terms
of
bias
mitigation
by
examining
the
outputs
generated
from
ten
prompts
based
on
various
professions,
and
testing
for gender bias within these generated images.

Smilovici et al. | Occupational gender biases in DALL-E 2
Literature Review
Though
OpenAI’ s
DALL-E
2
can
still
be
considered
a
relatively
new
platform,
research
and
relevant
publications
do
exist
regarding
the
subject
of
representation
within
text-to-image
models.
In
the
paper
‘How
well
can
Text-to-Image
Generative
Models
understand
Ethical
Natural
Language
Interventions?’,
Bansal
et
al.
study
the
tendencies
of
text-to-image
models
to
favor
select
social
groups
when generating images.
According
to
Bansal
et
al.,
text-to-image
models
are
classified
as
platforms
that
“synthesize
high-quality
photo-realistic
images
conditional
on
natural
language
text
descriptions”
(p.1).
Within
the
study ,
the
author ’s
goal
was
to
analyze
the
results
from
text-to-image
models
when
prompted
by
an
objectively
neutral
description.
The
analysis
conducted
was
measured
on
a
set
of
three
axes:
gender ,
skin
tone,
and
westernization.
One
example
provided
was
when
prompted
to
generate
“a
lawyer”,
a
model
should
provide
a
fair
representation of a lawyer upon the three axes.
Similarly ,
in
their
paper
titled
‘DALL-Eval:
Probing
the
Reasoning
Skills
and
Social
Biases
of
Text-to-Image
Generative
Models’,
Bansal,
Yin,
Monajatipoor ,
and
Chang
find
that
while
DALL-E
2
is
able
to
generate
images
consisting
of
diverse
social
groups,
these
results
can
easily
be
affected
by
key
phrases
such
as
“irrespective
of
gender”(p.
5).
As
a
result,
it
can
be
concluded
that
while
text-to-image
models
from
leading
vendors
do
incorporate
some
methods
of
diversity
auditing,
the
explainability
behind
the
processes
is
still
lacking.
The
authors
conclude
with
a
statement
that
the
topic
of
ethics
and
representation
within
text-to-image
models
is
one that still “needs further exploration” (p. 5).
Although
models
like
DALL-E
2
are
relatively
novel,
the
idea
of
using
queries
to
generate
image
results
has
been
previously
seen
in
the
ubiquitous
search
engine,
Google.
These
search
engines
operate
in
a
similar
manner ,
where
a
user
inputs
a
query
and
search
results
(such
as
images)
can
be
displayed.
In
‘Has
CEO
Gender
Bias
Really
Been
Fixed?
Adversarial
Attacking
and
Improving
Gender
Fairness
in
Image
Search’,
authors
Yunhe
Feng
and
Chirag
Shah
re-examine
the
real-world
impacts
of
gender
fairness
in
these
search
engines,
noting
that
“gender
bias
for
certain
professions
could
change
searchers’
world
views”
(p.1).
While
they
acknowledge
efforts
by
companies,
such
as
Alphabet,
to
correct
existing
biases
in
their
tools,
their
paper
proposes
adversarial
attack
queries
to
thoroughly
test
for
bias
mitigation
in
image
search
engines.
Their
analysis
consisted
of
randomly
selecting
and
searching
ten
occupations
and
corresponding
adversarial
attack
search
terms
such
as
appending
‘United
States’
to
trigger
potential
biases
in
their
searches.
Through
these
methods
they
demonstrated
that
despite
adversarial
attacks
successfully
triggering
high
levels
of
gender
bias,
their
re-ranking
algorithms
show
that
it
is
possible
to
address
bias
in
image
search
in
a
“systematic,
sustainable,
and
more
meaningful
way
than
doing
individual
query
fixes
in
an
ad
hoc
fashion”
(p.
7).
Thus,
showing
that
mitigation
of
image
search
(and
similar tools) can be successful.
Finally ,
while
much
of
the
literature
surrounding
bias
usually
pertains
to
determining
whether
or
not
it
exists
in
an
algorithm,
Vlasceanu
and
Amodio
cover
the
effects
and
impacts
of
gender
bias
in
algorithms
in
their
paper
titled
‘Propagation
of
societal
gender
inequality
by
internet
search
algorithms’.
In
this
paper ,
they
cover
the
positive
feedback
loop
that
is
created
by
algorithms
returning
biased
results
that
decision
makers
expect
to
see,
which
in
turn
leads
to
said
decision
makers
making
biased
decisions
that
influence
said
algorithms.
In
what
the
authors
call
a
‘novel
labor-market
scenario’
they
specifically
find
that
‘participants
were
more
likely
to
form
male
prototypes
of
a
profession’
when
‘exposed
to
search
result
patterns
from
high-inequality
nations’,
while
‘[e]xposure
to
search
2
Smilovici et al. | Occupational gender biases in DALL-E 2
result
patterns
from
low-inequality
nations
eliminated
this
effect’,
which
demonstrates
the
tangible
negative
effects
of
gender
bias
in
a
hiring
and
occupation-based
context.
Their
overall
investigation
and
results
help
cement
the
case
for
why
bias
in
widely-used
AI
based
image
algorithms,
including DALL-E 2, should be mitigated.
Methods
Limitations
Due
to
the
fact
that
this
project
had
no
financial
backing,
the
decision
was
made
to
remain
within
the
free
credit
limit
OpenAI
would
give
to
each
member
of
the
group.
This
resulted
in
the
fact
that
only
ninety
dollars
worth
of
images,
in
total,
could
be
generated.
This
was
a
key
limitation
in
the
ensuing
investigation,
although
not
at
all
a
complete
roadblock.
Another
limitation
of
this
analysis
is
the
treatment
of
gender
as
a
binary
feature.
Ultimately ,
the
authors
of
this
paper
acknowledge
that
gender
is
not
an
attribute
that
any
third
party
can
reasonably
detect
with
certainty .
As
such
it
is
not
the
intention
of
this
paper
to
reinforce
the
inherently
incorrect
notion
that gender is binary .
Initial Exploration
The
first
step
was
to
find
a
statistically
robust
and
reputable
source
from
which
to
derive
the
prompts.
Ultimately
the
source
chosen
was
the
US
Bureau
of
Labor
Statistics
(BLS)
and
specifically
their
‘Labor
Force
Statistics
from
the
Current
Population
Survey’,
which
can
be
found
in
the
references
section
below .
Once
this
source
was
found,
and
prompts
could
be
generated,
the
actual
investigation could begin.
Procedure
Upon
finding
a
good
source
to
obtain
prompts
from,
the
next
step
was
deciding
what
was
meant
by
an
‘unbiased
resultset’.
Here
there
were
two
options;
first
to
use
the
actual
statistical
percentage
of
each
gender
in
a
profession
as
a
benchmark
for
‘unbiased’,
and
second
to
use
a
more
ideal
and
representative
benchmark
of
equal
gender
parity;
that
is
to
say
half
of
the
images
were
expected
to
be
feminine-presenting
and
the
other
half
were
expected
to
be
masculine-presenting.
The
second
option
was
deemed
superior
(in
simple
terms
because
reflecting
the
bias
of
the
real
world
is
a precursor to representative harms)..
Once
this
benchmark
was
selected,
the
next
step
was
to
determine
how
many
and
which
prompts
to
pass
through
DALL-E
2.
The
first
consideration
here
was
the
previously
mentioned
hard
limit
of
ninety
dollars
which
could
not
be
exceeded.
The
second
consideration
was
ensuring
that
DALL-E
2
was
not
biased
towards
or
against
either
gender
in
particular .
The
third
consideration
was
determining
how
large
of
a
sample
would
be
necessary
in
order
to
arrive
at
a
robust
and
statistically sound conclusion.
It
also
became
apparent
that
choosing
occupations
with
a
particularly
heavy
bias
would
be
too
trivial;
these
occupations
demanded
a
minute
sample
size,
but
were
also
deemed
insignificant,
in
the
sense
that
the
internal
bias
within
DALL-E
2
would
not
be
rigorously
tested
if
these
were
the
prompts
selected.
As
such
the
resulting
fourth
and
final
constraint
was
to
choose
prompts
such
that
each
occupation
could
have
no
more
than
65%
of
its
survey
respondents
dominated
by
a
single
gender
to
maintain
a
balance
between
image
generation
costs
and meaningful and statistically sound conclusions.
With
these
parameters
in
mind,
the
first
task
was
examining
how
large
of
a
sample
would
be
necessary
for
each
of
the
occupations
in
the
BLS
data.
This
was
calculated
using
the
one-sample
dichotomous
outcome
formula
mentioned
in
the
reference
section
below .
Once
these
sample
sizes
were
calculated,
it
became
apparent
that
a
good
sample
size
to
use
across
the
board
was
210
images
per
occupation;
this
was
the
highest
number
of
samples
demanded
by
an
occupation
in
order
to
3
Smilovici et al. | Occupational gender biases in DALL-E 2
conduct
this
statistical
test.
This
also
meant
that
only
ten
occupations
could
be
selected
for
investigating DALL-E 2.
In
accordance
with
the
second
parameter
listed
above,
five
of
those
occupations
were
selected
to
be
dominated
by
female-presenting
individuals,
while
the
remaining
five
were
selected
as dominated by male-presenting.
Ultimately
the
ten
occupations
selected
as
prompts
can
be
seen
in
the
table
below
along
with
the
percentage
of
female-presenting
individuals
within
each
occupation,
as
determined
by
the
BLS
data:

These
ten
prompts
were
then
put
through
DALL-E
2
such
that
210
images
were
generated
for
each
occupation.
Upon
the
completion
of
the
image
generation
step,
all
2100
images
were
labeled
by
each
co-author
of
this
report,
and
the
mode
of
their
responses
was
assigned
as
the
label
for
each
image.
A
more
graphical
representation
of
this
methodology can be found in appendix section 1.3.
Statistics
After
the
data
collection,
all
image
sets
and
corresponding
labels
were
analyzed
through
permutation
testing
against
an
ideal
demographic
parity
of
50-50
(half
of
the
results
were
expected
to
be
female-presenting,
half
were
expected
to
be
male-presenting).
Permutation
tests
using
the
absolute
difference
in
proportion
of
male-presenting
images
were
selected
as
the
statistical
tests
of
choice
due
to
their
ability
to
arrive
at
a
conclusion
without
making
underlying
assumptions
about
the
normality
or
shape
of
the
underlying
data.
The
level
of
significance
was
set
at
0.05
for
all
tests
run
on
the
generated
data
and
the
null
and
alternative
hypotheses were set as follows:
H
0
:
The
images
generated
from
DALL-E
2
for this occupation follow demographic parity
H
A
:
The
images
generated
from
DALL-E
2
for this occupation do not follow demographic parity
Results
Each
image
generated
by
DALL-E
2
was
assigned
a
label
corresponding
to
the
most
common
gender
labeled
by
group
members.
From
this,
the
observed
proportion
of
male-presenting
images
was
calculated.
Notably ,
only
a
single
occupation:
‘Secondary
School
Teacher ’
had
a
majority
of
female-presenting
images
(0.42),
though
the
majority
of
images
for
this
occupation
were
cartoons.
Other
careers
displayed
a
majority
of
male-presenting
images.
‘Fitness
Instructor ’,
‘Pharmacist’,
and
‘Dentist”
had
proportions
of
0.60,
0.67,
and
0.87
respectively .
The
remaining
occupations,
‘Janitor ’,
‘Cook’,
‘Bartender ’,
‘Financial
Analyst’,
and
‘Lawyer ’
had
no
female-presenting
images.
Permutation
testing,
conducted
against
our
hypothesis,
showed
significant
results
with
a
0.05
threshold
for
significance
for
all
occupations,
indicating
that
images
generated
from
DALLE-2
for
these occupations do not follow demographic parity .

Discussion
Although
the
literature
surrounding
DALL-E
2
and
general
perception
towards
the
application
pointed
towards
some
bias,
the
results
were
relatively
unexpected
in
terms
of
their
magnitude,
especially
when
considering
the
blog
post
made
by
OpenAI
in
July
of
2022,
wherein
they
reaffirmed
their
commitment
to
addressing
machine
learning
bias
via
an
unnamed
‘new
technique’.
As
the
results
section
above
demonstrates,
there
were
several
cases
where
not
even
a
single
female-presenting
response
was
generated
(‘Janitor ’,
‘Cook’,
‘Bartender ’,
‘Lawyer ’,
and
‘Financial
Analyst’).
And
even
in
certain
occupations
where
the
data
provided
by
the
Bureau
of
Labor
Statistics
indicated
a
female-majority ,
DALL-E
2
still
skewed
male-presenting
in
terms
of
the
distribution
of
these
result
sets,
most
glaringly
when
it
generated
images
of bartenders.
This
certainly
means
that
either
the
DALL-E
2
generative
model,
or
at
least
the
API
access
point
is
biased.
This
is
an
important
distinction
to
make,
due
to
the
fact
that
while
visiting
the
web
interface
for
the
model,
there
were
instances
where
a
prompt
that
generated
an
overwhelmingly
male-presenting
dominated
response
would
return
a
female-presenting
image.
When
considering
the
extremity
of
some
of
the
5
Smilovici et al. | Occupational gender biases in DALL-E 2
result
sets
obtained,
it
becomes
reasonable
to
assume
that
there
is
some
versioning
conflict
between
the
model
that
the
API
uses,
and
the
model
that
the
public
interface
uses.
Thus
this
becomes
a
key limitation of this overall study .
However ,
this
limitation
can
be
set
aside
when
considering
that
applications
using
OpenAI
generative
models
will
likely
use
their
API
and
not
their
public-facing
application.
Thus
any
bias
found
in
the
API
will
also
be
inherent
in
any
applications
that
use
it,
and
so
this
remains
a
major
problem
that
OpenAI should address.
It
is
for
at
least
the
reason
above
that
the
gravity
of
these
results
cannot
be
understated;
DALL-E
2
is
highly
biased
in
terms
of
its
outputs
and
as
it
begins
to
see
mainstream
usage
outside
of
personal
entertainment
(for
instance,
Microsoft
using
another
model
trained
on
the
same
data
with
a
similar
underlying
algorithm
(ChatGPT)
to
supplement
its
Bing
search
engine),
more
of
the
general
populace
will
begin
to
suffer
the
effects
of
a
heavily biased model.
Occupational
gender
bias
especially
is
quite
impactful
due
to
its
ability
to
entrench
current-day
gender
norms
and
prevent
societal
progress
towards
equity
across
occupations.
A
relevant
study
to
this
point
is
a
paper
by
Vlasceanu
and
Amodio
titled
‘Propagation
of
societal
gender
inequality
by
internet
search
algorithms’,
in
which
they
underline
the
effect
of
biased
search
algorithm
outputs
on
a
society’ s
cognitive
concepts
(specifically
how
the
perception
of
the
prototypical
individual
can
shift
based
on
these
search
results,
thus leading to more oppression and discrimination).
Thus
the
overall
investigation
highlights
the
need
for
a
firmer
commitment
from
OpenAI
to
mitigating
the
bias
inherent
in
their
models,
specifically
in
regards
to
occupational
gender
bias.
Potential
avenues
for
future
investigation
include
repeating
this
same
analysis
for
the
DALL-E
series
of
models
in
the
future
in
order
to
examine
whether
or
not
the
bias
present
in
the
algorithm
has
been
visibly
addressed,
as
well
as
investigating
potential
bias
mitigation
strategies
OpenAI
could
implement
to address this problem.
Conclusion
Thus
with
an
alpha
of
0.05
and
a
sample
size
of
210
images
per
prompt,
this
paper
proves
the
existence
of
significant
occupational
gender
bias
in
OpenAI’ s
DALL-E
2
model.
Several
prompts
did
not
even
generate
a
majority
female-presenting
response,
even
when
the
data
obtained
from
the
BLS
indicated
that
the
profession
was
female
dominated.
In
one
such
case
where
a
female-presenting
majority
was
expected,
no
female-presenting
responses
were
generated
whatsoever .
While
the
impacts
of
such
extreme
bias
may
not
be
immediately
apparent,
as
the
model
begins
to
see
more
widespread
use
across
various
applications,
the
impacts
(such
as
a
potential
increase
in
gender
based
discrimination
while
hiring)
will
likely
grow
more
severe
and
visible.
As
such,
OpenAI
should
move
to
address
the
bias
present
in
their
algorithms
as
soon
as
possible,
before they see widespread commercial use.

1.3 Methodology supplement
The
precise
set
of
steps
followed
over
the
course
of
this investigation are as follows:
1.
Occupation Selection:
a.
Occupations
were
chosen
based
on
their
proximity
to
having
demographic
parity
in
the
workplace.
Prompts
were
generated
using
the
phrase
‘Face
of
a
<occupation>’,
eg.
‘Face
of
a
Lawyer ’.
2.
Sample-Size Selection:
a.
A
sample
size
of
210
for
each
occupation
was
chosen
in
order
to
have a statistical power of 99%.
3.
Image Generation Through DALLE-2:
a.
For
each
occupation
selected,
210
images
were
generated
and
stored
with
a
filename
associated
with its occupation.
4.
Labeling:
a.
Each
image
was
manually
labeled
by
all
co-authors
and
given
a
final
label
based
on
the
majority
consensus.
5.
Dataset Creation
a.
Dataset

","The study investigates the bias in OpenAI's image-generation model, DALL-E 2, specifically in terms of gender and occupation. The researchers selected ten professions from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' listing and generated images using DALL-E 2. They found that the generated images were significantly biased, with certain occupations having no female-presenting images at all.

Abstract
When
buying
an
airplane
ticket
there
are
multiple
factors
that
can
result
in
largely
different
prices
in
flights.
As
a
result,
there
exist
multiple
different
avenues
for
price
discrimination
to
occur.
Here,
we
investigate
the
effects
of
local
demographics
on
the
pricing
of
a
given
flight.
Specifically,
we
look
into
potential
biases
with
regard
to
race
and
income
in
terms
of
the
metropolitan
area.
This
is
done
through
bias
analysis
and
mitigation
via
the
AIF360
toolkit.
In
turn,
we
aim
to
develop
models
that
balance
both
accuracy
as
well
as
fairness
between
our
classes
to
provide
insights
for
a
better
pricing
strategy
for
airlines
and
pricing
information
to
consumers.
In
terms
of
pricing
bias
based
upon
metropolitan
demographics,
we
found
that
there
was
little
bias
present
in
the
data
and
in
the
models
we
developed.
While
the
bias
was
not
significant,
we
found
a
correlation
between
our
set
demographics
and
pricing
as
well
as
created
models
that
balance
both
fairness
and
accuracy
which
demonstrates
practical
applicability
of
bias mitigation techniques.
Hypothesis
We
anticipated
that
there
would
be
a
significant
difference
between
flight
fares
when
comparing
our
privileged
and
unprivileged
classes.
Here,
our
classes
will
be
determined
by
race
(white
and
non-white),
and
income
(high
and
low)
of
the
local
airport
metro
area
population.
Low
income
here
is
defined
to
be
whether
the
median
of
the
local
income
is
less
than
or
equal
to
the
25th
quantile
threshold
found
from
a
distribution
of
median incomes across all metro areas.
Introduction
Price
discrimination
is
the
practice
of
setting
significantly
different
prices
for
different
groups
of
people
for
the
same
or
similar
commodity.
This
is
specifically
known
as
third-degree
price
discrimination.
As
a
result,
this
can
often
lead
to
optimized
profits
for
the
seller,
with
a
subset
of
buyers
left
paying
higher
prices.
In
the
airline
industry,
there
are
several
features
such
as
distance
and
airport
that
can
affect
the
fare
price
as
well
as
external
forces
such
as
market
concentration
and
1
competitors.
In
turn,
the
local
demographics
of
airport
metro
areas
are
features
we
hypothesize
may
distinguish
significant
pricing
discrimination
between
majority
and
minority
populations
in
airfare
prices
when
comparing
similarly
comparable
flights.
The
goal
here
is
to
identify
potential
factors
in
the
dataset
that
may
be
causing
biases
in
model
implementations,
mitigating
these
biases,
and
ultimately
developing
fairer
machine
learning
models for fairer airfare pricing.

Price
discrimination
is
an
issue
that
is
being
observed
by
many
through
various
similar
projects.
The
first
project
we
will
be
evaluating
is
a
project
that
focuses
on
investigation
on
price
discrimination
within
the
airline
industry
by
comparing
prices
to
similar
users.
The
project
was
conducted
by
Stefano
Azzolina
from
the
Department
of
Economics
at
the
University of Bologna, Manuel Razza from   the
Italian
Competition
Authority,
Kevin
Sartiano
from
the
Department
of
Engineering
at
Uninettuno
University,
and
Emanuel
Weitschek
from
the
Department
of
Engineering
at
Uninettuno
University
and
the
Italian
Competition
Authority.
Data
for
study
was
gathered
through
a
software
that
obtained
user
information
from
information
provided
as
they
purchase
airline
tickets
online.
The
Flight
Data
Acquisition
Software
collected
data
under
two
workflows
which
are
flight
search
similarities
and
flight
search
differences.
The
results
of
this
study
revealed
that
price
discrimination
was
prevalent
as
we
see
differences
in
prices
amongst
different
types
of
users.
The
study
goals
are
similar
to
the
investigation
we
analyzed
through
this
project.
However,
instead
of
using
data
from
users,
we
collected
data
from
survey
data
and
utilized
the
AI
Fairness
360
toolkit.
Another
difference
is
that
our
project
observes
comparison
among
flight
paths,
which
entails
ticket
purchasers
within
the same origin and destination locations.
The
next
study
was
conducted
by
Kevin
R.
Williams
used
airline
dynamics
to
create
a
model
to
predict
pricing.
Airlines
dynamics
are
factors
such
as
demand
and
scarcity
that
make
airlines
adjust
their
prices
daily
based
on
potential
customers'
willingness
to
purchase
tickets
for
airlines
set
prices.
The
reality
is
that
airline
industries
use
these
factors
to
make
a
profit.
The
proposed
model
utilizes
stochastic
demand
features
and
revenue
management
models
to
predict
airline
ticket
pricing.
The
model
reveals
the
competitiveness
that
airlines
pricing
can
lead
to
price
discrimination.
Employing
similar
models
and
analysis
on
airline
data
can
help
prevent
price
discrimination
that
are
created
out
of
the
competitiveness
of
purchasing
airline
tickets.
Compared
to
our
projects,
both
create
models
to
predict
ticket
pricing.
We
believe
that
the
model
from
Kevin
R.
Williams
focuses
on
the
domain
knowledge
of
economics
that
reveals
the
reasoning
behind
pricing.
Our
model
focuses
on
the
fairness
of
the
model,
in
fact
attempting
to
mitigate
the
bias
within
our
model.
Datasets
The
airline
ticket
and
pricing
data
are
provided
by
the
Airline
Origin
and
Destination
Survey
(DB1B).
The
DB1B
database
is
a
dataset
that
is
maintained
by
the
United
States
Department
of
Transportation
Bureau
of
Transportation
Statistics.
Origin
and
Destination
Survey
(DB1B)
is
a
10%
sample
of
airline
tickets
from
reporting
carriers
in
the
United
States.
Data
includes
origin,
destination
and
other
itinerary
details
of
passengers
transported.
The
DB1B
database
has
data
from
1993
to
the
2nd
Quarter
of
2022,
however,
due
to
the
constraints
of
our
computing
environment
capabilities,
we
are
only
using
the
data
from
2018
to
the
most
recent available record in our project.
While
the
DB1B
database
does
not
include
demographics
such
as
race,
age,
or
income,
for
our
purposes,
we
are
instead
using
U.S.
Census
data
in
order
to
get
feature
variables
that
describe
the
local
populations
of
the
origin
airport
metropolitan
area
and
the
destination
airport metropolitan area.
By
merging
these
two
datasets,
we
are
able
to
investigate
the
relationship
between
local
population
demographics
and
airline
ticket
prices.
Before
beginning
our
analysis,
it
is
important
to
establish
that
our
target
variable,
airline
ticket
fare
per
mile
(FarePerMile),
will
be
categorized
into
two
classes
under
a
new
variable
called
fare_class.
For
the
preferred
outcome
or
group,
we
will
have
fares
that
are
below
the
third
quartile
or
75th
percentile
of
the
fare-per-mile
distribution.
For
the
unpreferred
outcome
or
group,
we
will
have
fares
that
are
above
the
third
quartile
which
essentially
represents
a
high-cost
fare.
This
then
turns
our
predictive
task
into
a
classification
problem
instead
of
a
regression
which
is
necessary
as
we
are
concerned
with
a
range
of
values
being
fair
or
belonging
to
the
same
group
instead
of
how
precisely
the
exact
cost of two tickets is.
The
database
also
does
not
include
the
general
details
(such
as
total
passenger
count,
amount
of
flights
on
a
given
route)
from
a
given
set
of
flight
details.
To
further
enhance
our
ability
to
capture
a
well-behaved
model
for
our
analysis,
we
also
incorporated
data
from
the
Air
Carrier
Statistics
(Form
41
Traffic)-
U.S.
Carriers
(T-100)
from
the
United
States
Department
of
Transportation
Bureau
of
Transportation
Statistics.
This
dataset
contains
domestic
market
data
reported
by
U.S.
air
carriers,
including
carrier,
origin,
destination,
and
service
class
for
enplaned
passengers,
freight
and
mail
when
both
origin
and
destination
airports
are
located
within
the
boundaries
of
the United States and its territories.
EDA
We
conducted
our
EDA
using
the
database
listed
above
and
on
other
associated
datasets.
In
this
section,
we
would
present
our
methodology
during
our
analysis
and
how
the
detailed
findings
help
our
future
progress
in
project findings.
Processing the DB1B Dataset
The
original
Ticket
in
the
DB1B
dataset
records
information
on
the
itinerary
level.
Since
one
itinerary
might
have
multiple
flights
and
destinations
depending
on
whether
it
is
a
round
trip
or
has
multiple
stops
along
the
way.
Therefore,
we
merge
the
Ticket
dataset
with
the
Market/Coupon
dataset
on
itinerary
ID,
and
it
allows
us
to
look
closer
into
ticket
information
on
an
individual
flight
level.
On
average
for
each
quarter
the
combined
dataset
has
around
6
million
rows
and
26
useful
features
after
we
exclude
other
redundant
columns,
where
each
row
represents
a
ticket
and
its
associated
information.
Details
of
the
columns
and
variables
are
available
on
the
project website.
Since
the
DB1B
dataset
is
build
on
the
ticket
level,
meaning
that
the
ticket
could
have
segments
that
represents
either
be
a
one-way,
a
round-trip
or
a
muilt-destination
ticket.
Therefore,
there
is
not
a
clearly
define
destination.
We
decided
to
use
observe
the
destination
in
dataset
in
based
on
various
assumptions
shown
below,
which
are
also
implemented in our “
sparkmanager.py
”:
Assumption
Method
name in
module
Resulting
dataset size
The last
destination is
“default”
98898392
(total
the real
destination
amount of
tickets)
The median
point is the
real
destination
“midpoint”
98898392
(total
amount of
tickets)
Each
segment
should be
separate
“segment”
247175573
(all avaiable
rows in the
dataset)
After
our
data
wrangling
work,
we
immediately
found
the
default
approach
is
problematic
because
over
60%
of
the
tickets
are
considered
roundtrips.
As
a
result,
over
60%
of
tickets
using
such
an
approach
results
in
the
same
origin
and
destination.
The
median
approach
shows
some
promising
results,
however
it
also
means
it
is
losing
a
lot
of
information
that
could
be
able
to
be
represented
in
the
segments.
Therefore,
after
our
experiment
on
the
three
approaches,
we
decided
to
treat
each
segment
as
an
individual
ticket
in
our
future
analysis
as
it
would
keep
the most information intact.
Fare Per Mile in 2022 dollars
Ticket Prices in 2022 dollars
To
further
perform
a
better
and
more
accurate
analysis,
we
also
used
the
cpi
module
in
Python
to
change
all
of
our
prices
into
2022
prices
from
their
respective
years.
The
prices
shown
below
the
EDA
section
are
the
original
number
of
prices,
unless
specifically
stated
of
using the cpi adjusted 2022 prices.
Trends and Findings of the DB1B Dataset
Distribution of FarePerMile in DB1B prior
to outlier filtering
Distribution of FarePerMile in DB1B after
to outlier filtering
Our
focus
on
pricing
prompted
us
to
focus
most
of
our
effort
in
it
when
it
comes
to
finding
trends
in
the
dataset.
Therefore,
it
becomes
essential
to
analyze
the
FarePerMile
(fare
per
mile)
and
ItinFare
(ticket
itinerary
fare).
We
immediately
look
into
the
general
distribution
of
the
two
variables
and
find
a
small but extremely strong set of outliers.
After
a
thorough
investigation,
we
discovered
that
the
bottom
1%-tile
and
the
upper
99%-tile
had
huge
outliers
that
swayed
the
variable.
Therefore,
we
decided
to
drop
those
rows
in
our
following
analysis
due
to
the
belief
that
such may be a result of human error.
By
plotting
them
against
their
respected
year
and
quarters,
we
found
that
they
in
general
follow each other quite well.
In
the
case
of
FarePerMile,
the
variable
is
relatively
stable,
prior
to
the
2020
Q1,
hovering
between
26-27
cents
in
each
quarter.
There
is
a
significant
drop
during
the
first
3
quarters
of
2020
from
the
average
of
25
cents
to
the
lowest
at
18
cents.
The
variable
since
then
steadily
rebounded
to
24
cents
at
the
last
quarter
of
2021,
and
spiked
to
the
highest
point
in 2022 Q2 and Q3 of 28 cents.
In
the
case
of
ItinFare,
the
variable
is
relatively
stable,
prior
to
the
2020
Q1,
hovering
between
$400-$430
in
each
quarter.
There
is
a
significant
drop
during
the
first
3
quarters
of
2020
from
the
average
of
$390
to
the
lowest
at
$270.
The
variable
since
then
steadily
rebounded
to
$390
at
the
last
quarter
of
2021,
and
spiked
to
the
highest
point
in
2022
Q2
and
Q3
of
$470.
It
is
important
to
note
that
this
variable
is
highly
influenced
by
the
rate
of
round-trip
travel,
as
a
round-trip
ticket
fare
is
counted
as
the
same
as
a
one-way
trip
ticket
in
this
variable.
Our
analysis
found
(also
shown
below),
on
average
60%
of
the
tickets
are
classified as round-trip travels.
We
then
focused
on
finding
whether
there
is
a
noticeable
difference
between
the
quarters
of
the ticket used on travel.
Our
analysis
shows
that
in
the
years
prior
to
the
pandemic
(2016-2019),
both
FarePerMile
and
ItinFare
follows
a
general
trend
with
both
Q2
and
Q4
peaking
in
each
respective
years.
However,
the
same
analysis
provided
insight
on
the
significance
of
the
pandemic
effects
during the later years of the dataset.
Average FarePerMile of each reporting
carrier in DB1B
Airline-wise,
low-cost
airlines
like
Spirit
have
an
average
fare-per-mile
of
0.1$,
while
Regional
Airline
like
Silver
Airways
has
the
highest
average
fare-per-mile
of
0.6$.
On
the
other
hand,
Legacy
carriers
like
United,
Delta,
and
American
Airlines
have
relatively
moderate
and
similar
average
fare-per-mile
(~
0.3$),
which
we
think
can
be
a
scenario
of
market
competition.
Nevertheless,
Legacy
carriers
have
a
dominant
market
share,
over
65%
of
the
tickets
in
this
combined
dataset
belong to these airlines.
By
visualizing
the
dollar
amount
presented
as
revenue,
we
allow
us
to
investigate
whether
there
are
airlines
that
have
a
sharp
competitive
edge,
where
they
earn
more
money
yet
by
flying
fewer
passengers.
Our
analysis
shows
that this is likely not the case.
To
further
investigate
the
significant
impact
during
the
pandemic,
we
decided
to
look
into
the
flight
volumes
associated
with
the
dataset
more.
We
found
it
matches
our
findings
and
expectations.
Processing
the
US
Census
and
Defining
the
Protected Groups
Distribution of White Population Ratio in
the Dataset
Distribution of Household Median Income in
the Dataset
The
racial
and
income
groups
for
each
airport’s
metropolitan
area
information
taken
from
the
US
Census
allows
us
to
gather
information
of
our
protected
groups.
After
conducting
data
cleaning
with
the
Census
data,
we
produce
two
separate
datasets,
Race
and
Income.
Both
dataset
has
754
rows
and
8
columns,
where
each
row
represents
a
Micro/Metro
Area
that
is
related
to
an
airport
code
that
is
listed
in
the
DB1B
dataset
and
has
corresponding
demographic
details
(e.g.
ratio
of
White
and
Non-White population).
The
Income
dataset
has
513
rows
and
5
columns,
where
each
row
represents
a
Micro/Metro
Area
and
has
corresponding
income
statistics.
Based
on
the
shared
Area
code,
we
will
merge
these
two
datasets
with
the
combined
ticket
dataset
above.
Rows
that
don’t
have
matching
area
codes
are
omitted
during
the
merging
process.
In
other
words,
it
is
an
inner
merge
as
we
want
to
ensure
each
ticket
purchased
comes
with
detailed
information about its origin/destination city.
Bias Discoveries on the DB1B Dataset
To
ensure
our
bias
discovery
process
would
be
as
fair
as
possible,
we
used
the
2022
dollars
for
this
part
of
the
analysis.
We
first
started
with
uncovering
the
difference
of
means
in
fare
per
mile
between
different
protected
groups
and
privileged groups based on their destinations.
Based on origination of flight:
-
Privileged Group:
-
High income
-
Dominant Race
-
Protected Group
-
Low income
-
Minority Race
Protected
Attribute
Privileged
group mean
Protected
group mean
Income
0.2373
0.3177
Ethnicity
0.2978
0.2859
The
privileged
group
for
the
attribute
of
income
pays
the
least
of
0.2373
while
the
protected
group
of
income
pays
the
most
at
0.3177
fare
per
mile.
For
ethnicity,
the
privileged
group
pays
more
than
the
protected
group,
and
there
is
a
much
closer
margin
between
them
which
implies
that
pricing
is
more balanced than income.
Based on destination of flight:
-
Privileged Group:
-
High income
-
Dominant Race
-
Protected Group
-
Low income
-
Minority Race
Protected
Attribute
Privileged
group mean
Protected
group mean
Income
0.2385
0.3242
Ethnicity
0.3106
0.2894
Similar
to
above,
when
grouped
on
destination
of
flight,
the
privileged
group
of
income
pays
the
least
at
0.2385
while
the
protected
group
pays
the
most
at
0.3242.
With
ethnicity,
the
privileged
group
pays
more
than
the
protected
group with a smaller margin.
Flight
with
different
groups
in
origin
and
destination
-
Privileged Group:
-
High income
-
Dominant Race
-
Protected Group
-
Low income
-
Minority Race
Groups
Fare Per mile

0.2734
Income Protected →
Privileged
0.2648
Ethnicity Protected →
Privileged
0.2648
Ethnicity Privileged →
Protected
0.2502
When
looking
at
FarePerMile
across
income
and
ethnicity
at
the
same
time,
we
can
see
that
going
from
an
income-privileged
area
to
a
protected
area
has
the
highest
fare
per
mile,
but
the margins between each are generally small.
Flight
with
same
groups
in
origin
and
destination:
-
Privileged Group:
-
High income
-
Dominant Race
-
Protected Group
-
Low income
-
Minority Race
Protected
Attribute
Privileged
group mean
Protected
group mean
Income
0.2077
0.4519
Ethnicity
0.2416
0.3067
When
we
make
both
the
origin
and
destination
city
the
same
type
(privileged
to
privileged),
we
see
that
margins
increase
even
further.
With
the
protected
income
group
having
a
much
higher
cost
of
0.4519
than
the
privileged
group
income
class
of
0.2077,
and
the
protected
ethnicity
class
also
pays
more
at
0.3067
compared to 0.2416.
Since
the
small
amount
of
representation
in
the
dataset
of
the
protected
groups
shown
above,
compared
to
the
privilege
groups.
Although
we
find
some
great
differences
between
groups,
we
did
not
find
such
a
difference
statistically
significant
enough.
Therefore,
we
may
not
conclude
that
the
dataset
itself
is
inherently
biased.
Another
discovery
that
we
take
to
further
investigate
the
relative
larger
differences
between
the
high
income
and
low
income
group
is
to
see
whether
there
is
a
strong
difference
in
their
standard
deviation,
which
if
it
is
lower
shows
a
low
price
variability
and
vice-versa.
We
found
out
that
the
low-income
groups
consistently
has
a
lower
standard-deviation
compared
to
the
high
income
group.
However,
this
may
also
be
the
result
of
there
is
far
less
samples of low income related flights included.
Further
Discoveries
and
Engineered
Variables
After
recognizing
the
general
trend
of
the
pricing
variables
and
the
relationship
with
other
variables
in
the
dataset,
we
looked
into
other
deeper
trends
to
determine
the
predictors
and predicted variables.
Fare Class Model
Distribution of FarePerMile Based on
FareClass
For the Fare Class Model, further analysis of
the relationship between FareClass and
FarePerMile features needs to be evaluated to
help classify the various fare classes as
favorable and unfavorable fare class for bias
analysis which will be described in more detail
later on in the report. The following histograms
show the frequency of FarePerMile for the
different Fare Classes.
FarePerMile Distribution for Class X
FarePerMile Distribution for Class Y
FarePerMile Distribution for Class C
FarePerMile Distribution for Class D
FarePerMile Distribution for Class F
FarePerMile Distribution for Class G
FarePerMile Distribution for Class U
As noted in previous analysis, outliers had to
be removed, specifically for FareClass X
analysis. Based on the distributions, we can
categorize classes Y, C, and D as favorable
classes, with their distributions being close to
the mean or even lower to the mean of
FarePerMile.
Transforming
Distance
to
Categorical
Variable
To
further
discover
how
flights
are
different
based
on
the
distance
traveled,
we
create
a
categorical
variable,
“Flight
Length,”
and
segment
our
ticket
into
three
categories:
“Short-haul”
flights
with
Miles
flown
less
than
1725
Miles,
“Medium-haul”
flights
with
Miles
flown
between
1725
and
3450
Miles,
and
“Long-haul”
flights
with
Miles
flown
bigger
than
3450
Miles.
We
group
by
the
variable
“Flight
Length”
and
discover
that
“Short-haul”
and
“Medium-haul”
take
up
around
80%
of
all
the recorded flights (around 40% each).
Although
our
EDA
focuses
on
the
first
quarter
of
2022,
this
ratio
varies
across
years
and
quarters.
The
average
fare
per
mile
is
the
highest
for
“Short-haul”
flights
and
the
lowest
for
“Long-haul”
flights.
In
other
words,
passengers
on
short-haul
flights
tend
to
pay
more
for
each
mile
they
are
flying.
If
most
of
the
flights
that
come
out
of
an
airport
are
short-haul,
then
residents
that
live
around
this
airport
might
have
to
bear
a
higher
fare
per
mile when purchasing flight tickets.
The
correlation
values
also
confirm
the
above
finding;
we
saw
a
negative
correlation
value
(-0.16)
between
the
target
variable
“fare-per-mile”
and
the
“MilesFlown.”
In
addition,
we
also
saw
other
features
like
“Coupons”,
“Passengers”,
“RoundTrip”,
“median_income”,
“None-white
alone
proportion_dest”,
and
“white
alone
proportion_dest”
having
a
moderate
correlation
(absolute
value
of
correlation
>
0.01,
choosing
this
threshold
given
that
there
are
so
many
features
in
the
dataset)
with
“fare-per-mile.”
The
correlation
values
suggest
there
are
connections
between
flight
fare
and
demographic
information,
implying
potential
biases
with
regard
to
race
and
income
in
price-setting models.
High Price Indicator Model
As
shown
in
below
section,
the
model
uses
the
CDF
of
the
price
variables
as
the
sensitivity
metric,
based
on
the
origin,
destination
and
the
reporting carrier.
The
sensitivity
metric
is
calculated
by
taking
all
the
ticket
prices
and
the
related
fare
per
mile
in
2022
dollars
from
the
dataset
(2016-2022)
and
ranking
them
in
ascending
order
between
the
interval
of
0
to
1
in
groups
of
origin,
destination,
and
the
airline.
On
the
training
data,
0
represents
the
lowest
price
available
in
the
dataset
on
a
given
city-pair
and
airline,
and
1
represents
the
highest
price
available
in
the
dataset
on
a
given
city-pair
and
airline.
Essentially,
the
values
are
the
CDF
of
the
distribution.
All
price
of
the
data
is
adjusted
by
the
CPI
index
(Airfare
category)
to
2022
dollars.
The
model
was
trained
based
on
data from 2016-2022 DB1B dataset.
We
interpret
if
the
model
predicts
1,
means
that
the
passenger
would
be
least
likely
to
make
a
purchase
of
a
fare
and
the
airline
would
most
likely
offer
such
a
fare.
If
the
model
predict
0,
means
the
passenger
would
be
most
likely
to
make
a
purchase
of
a
fare
and
the
airline
would
least
likely
offer
such
a
fare.
If
the
model
predicts
anything
that
is
>
1
or
<
0,
it
means
that the price is never going to happen.
Model Development
High Price Indicator Model
For
our
models,
the
data
is
grouped
by
flight
path
in
order
to
determine
if
our
privileged
class
would
be
predicted
to
pay
lower
FarePerMiles
in
contrast
to
our
unprivileged
groups.
Here,
our
privileged
group
would
be
white
majority
populations
when
summing
up
flight
origin
and
flight
destination
metropolitan
areas.
Our
unprivileged
group
is
non-white
majority
when
summing
up
flight
origin
and
flight
destination
areas.
This
variable
that
we
created
is
defined
as
our
“Race”
variable
and
it
contains
the
group
information
we
will
be
using
as
previously
described.
The
variables
used
in
our
models
for
predicting
high
or
low
FarePerMile
are
""RoundTrip"",
""OnLine"",
""DistanceGroup"",
""OriginCityMarketID"",
""LastCityMarketID"",
""RPCarrier"",
and
""ItinGeoType.""
Our
group
has
created
various
models
that
aim
to
predict
the
FarePerMile
model
while
mitigating
bias.
We
will
be
listing
the
models
that
are
the
most
accurate
or
insightful
in
understanding
and
mitigating
the
existing
bias
to
demonstrate
the
trade-off
between debiasing and accuracy.
Our
baseline
models
are
simple
logistic
regression
and
random
forest
regression
models
in
order
to
gauge
predictive
bias
and
performance.
Our
target
variable
is
created
by
applying
a
threshold
to
FarePerMile
where
any
flight
path
that
has
a
median
income
greater
than
the
75th
percentile
in
terms
of
median
income
In
testing,
we
are
using
2019
data
in
order
to
avoid
COVID-related
shifts
in
typical
air
trends
as
we
earlier
found
in
exploratory
data
analysis
that
the
trend
of
average
FarePerMile
drastically
changed
during
2020,
2021,
and
even
still
in
the
currently
available
2022 data.
In
terms
of
performance,
using
the
aforementioned
variables
alongside
a
logistic
regression
classifier
resulted
in
the
highest
best
balanced
accuracies
of
about
87%
when
using
data
from
2019.
The
random
forest
classifier
has
worse
performance
with
about
60%
accuracy.
Price Sensitivity Model
As
we
focuses
on
how
to
reduce
biases
in
model
in
pricing
models,
we
believe
it
is
essential
to
develop
a
tool
kit
that
has
the
ability
to
measure
the
chances
of
whether
a
flight
ticket
would
be
a
valid
and
accepted
by
a
given
stakeholder
(consumer
and
the
airlines),
given
all
the
attributes
of
such
a
ticket.
Not
only
because
such
a
tool
would
be
able
to
measure
whether
a
difference
between
different
protected
groups
exist
in
terms
of
price
acceptance
and
the
price
of
that
they
are
being
offered,
which
would
allow
a
thorough
investigation
in
pricing.
But
also
we
believe
it
would
be
useful
for
all
stakeholders
to
see
whether
a
given
price
and
a
given
set
of
ticket
attributes
would
be
realistic
or
not.
Since
all
the
data
in
the
datasets
are
the
prices
that
are
already
being
accepted
by
both
sides.
Therefore,
we
would
be
able
to
use
the
data
from
the
dataset
to
measuring
the
chances
of
a
hypothetical
ticket
would
be
accepted,
by
developing
a
model
to
compare
the
hypothetical
ticket
with
the
dataset
itself,
given
we
have
an
ability
to
determine
a
variable
that
would
represents
the
probability
of
a
given
entry in the dataset.
The
price
sensitivity
model
is
a
model
that
predicts
on
a
scale
from
0-1
to
showcase
whether
the
price
would
be
offered.
This
is
a
model
based
on
using
the
distribution
(CDF)
of
the
airfare
of
a
given
city-pair
origin
and
destination
and
the
carrier
from
the
DB1B
dataset.
The
CDF
serves
as
an
indicator
of
whether
a
given
airfare
would
appear
to
indicate
how
sensitive
a
given
fare
is
to
the
stakeholders
(Airline
and
Passengers),
as
it
is
able
to
capture
the
probability
of
whether
a
given ticket would be valid.
The
initial
model
of
such
a
prediction
runs
extremely
well,
our
first
initial
model
uses
sci-kit
learn’s
linear
regression
(sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression),
and
LightGBM’s
(lightgbm.LGBMRegressor).
Since
the
large
scale
of
the
dataset,
we
decided
the
initial
model
would
only
train
a
small
subset
that
is
randomly
selected
from
2018
Q2,
and
test
on
another
subset
of
the
same
quarter.
We
believe
such
an
approach
to
test
and
train
our
model
would
appropiate
during
our
initial
stage,
as
we
are
only
finding
ways
to
see
what
model
approach
and
variable
would
be
a
best
predictor.
Details
of
the
best
initial
model
are
shown on the website.
FareClass Model
Another
model
utilized
within
model
development
was
the
FareClass
Model.
The
FareClass
Model
is
a
random
forest
classifier
that
predicts
if
the
given
ticket
is
either
a
favorable
or
unfavorable
FareClass.
The
classification
for
the
FareClass
feature
was
determined
through
the
distribution
of
the
FarePerMile
attribute
for
each
of
the
FareClass.
Observing
the
distributions,
favorable
classes
had
distributions
that
were
centered
either
below
or
right
at
the
average
FarePerMile
for
all
FarePerMiles
values
together.
Other
features
incorporated
into
the
model
included
RoundTrip,
DollarCred,
Passengers,
ItinFare,
BulkFare,
Distance,
MilesFlown,
White
alone
proportion
and
Non-White
alone
proportion.
The
results
from
this
model
revealed
the
limited
bias
within
the
dataset.
Here’s the results of the following model:
The
following
results
were
gathered
based
on
the
data
from
the
first
Q1
of
2022.
The
Disparate
Impact
of
1.2261
on
the
model
prior
to
any
mitigation
methods
suggests
a
fair
model
from
the
very
beginning.
Now
the
focus
would
be
to
see
how
Reweighing
will
improve
the
fairness
of
the
model.
After
applying
the
preprocessing
technique
of
Reweighing,
we
see
the
model
fairness
improves
slightly
including
the
balanced
accuracy
of
the
model.
We
see
disparate
impact
reducing
to
get
closer
to
the
ideal
value
of
1
and
equal
opportunity
difference
and
theil
index
reducing
from
0.1957
to
0.059
and
0.1542
to
0.1440
respectively.
Further
details
about
the
fairness
metrics are detailed in the next section.

In
the
next
section,
we
will
evaluate
our
bias-mitigated
models
using
various
fairness
metrics
provided
by
the
AIF360
package.
We
will
give
a
thorough
touch
on
each
metric
used
to
better
help
comprehend
how
our
models
perform.
And
we
will
interpret
metrics
from
our
baseline
model
(no
bias
mitigator,
logistic
regression)  as an example.
Balanced
Accuracy
(BC):
0.876.
Balanced
accuracy
is
the
mean
between
the
true
positive
rate
and
the
true
negative
rate.
It
measures
the
average
accuracy
obtained
from
both
the
minority
and
the
majority
class.
A
score
of
0.876
signals
a
good
model
performance
in
identifying
negative
and
positive
classes.
However,
the
metric
itself
offers
trivial
indications regarding fairness.
Average
Odds
Difference
(AOD):
0.059.
The
average
odds
difference
value
is
the
average
difference
in
False
Positive
Rate
(FPR)
and
True
Positive
Rate
(TPR)
for
unprivileged
and
privileged
groups.
A
value
of
0
would
indicate
equality
of
chance
of
odds.
Therefore,
the
metric
with
value
close
to
0
would
suggest
fairness:
The
FPR
and
TPR
are
relatively
similar
between
privileged
groups
and
unprivileged groups.
Disparate
Impact
(DI):
1.243.
It
is
the
probability
of
positive
classification
in
the
unprivileged
group
divided
by
the
probability
of
positive
classification
in
the
privileged
group.
In
a
fair
situation,
we
expected
DI
to
be
close
to
1.
Therefore,
the
metric
with
value
of
1.243
signals
unfairness
even
though
the
results
favor
the
under-privileged
groups:
the
probability
of
positive
classification
is
significantly
higher
in
the
under-privileged
group than the privileged group.
Statistical
Parity
Difference
(SPD):
0.166.
The
metric
measures
the
differences
between
the
probability
of
positive
classification
in
the
unprivileged
group
and
the
probability
of
positive
classification
in
the
privileged
group.
A
value
that
is
different
from
0
will
indicate
unfairness
as
the
probability
of
positive
classification
is
different
between
privileged
and
unprivileged
groups.
A
positive
value
here
would
agree
with
the
DI
value
found
above,
where
the
probability
of
positive
classification
is
significantly
higher
in
the
under-privileged
group than the privileged group.
Equal
Opportunity
Difference
(EOD):
0.067.
This
metric
measures
the
difference
between
the
TPR
of
the
unprivileged
group
and
the
true
positive
rate
of
the
privileged
group.
A
value
that
is
significantly
different
than
0
will
indicate
unfairness
as
the
TPR
is
different
between
privileged
and
unprivileged
groups.
Therefore,
the
metric
with
value
close
to
0
would
suggest
fairness:
The
TPR
is
relatively
similar
between
privileged
group
and
unprivileged group.
Theil
Index
(TI):
0.065.
Theil
index
is
the
generalized
entropy
index
with
alpha
=
1.
It
measures
an
entropic
""distance""
the
population
is
away
from
the
""ideal""
egalitarian
state.
0
will
indicate
perfect
equality,
and
1
will
indicate
maximum
inequality.
Since
the
value
is
not
exactly
0,
the
metric
reveals
at
least
some level of unfairness.
Bias Analysis & Mitigation
High Price Indicator Model
In
order
to
measure
for
potential
biases,
we
are
using
the
AI
Fairness
360
package.
However,
throughout
the
model
development
process,
we
have
found
that
there
was
often
little
to
no
bias
in
the
models
to
mitigate
in
the
first
place.
The
baseline
logistic
regression
model
had
a
disparate
impact
value
of
1.24
and
a
statistical
parity
difference
of
0.16,
which
are
both
signs
that
our
unprivileged
class
is
receiving
more
favorable
outcomes
than
our
privileged
class.
Using
a
RandomForestClassificaiton
model
instead
results
in
less
bias,
but
the
performance
of
the
model
suffers
down
to
about
60%
accuracy.
As
mentioned
prior,
the
magnitude
of
these
biases
is
already
small
but
we
can
still
mitigate
them
in
order
to
see
how
they
would
affect the performance of the model.
For
example,
with
a
preprocessing
technique
known
as
reweighing,
where
weights
are
assigned
to
each
group
combination
prior
to
classification,
our
logistic
regression
model
has
a
disparate
impact
value
of
1
and
a
statistical
parity
difference
of
almost
0
which
means
that
the
bias
was
mitigated.
Additionally,
the
performance
only
drops
down
to
86%,
which
can
be
considered
negligible.
This
similarly
improved
the
bias
mitigation
for
our
Random
Forest
model
too
and
even
resulted in a small boost in accuracy.
Another
technique
we
can
apply
called
prejudice
remover
is
an
in-processing
technique
where
a
discrimination-aware
regularization
term
is
added.
This
managed
to
mitigate
the
bias
by
a
small
amount
but
was
largely
ineffective
in
significantly
dealing
with
bias.
It
did,
however,
manage
to
maintain
a
high
accuracy
of
about
87%
which
is
as
good
as
the
accuracy
seen
in
the
reweighed
logistic
regression classifier.

With
regards
to
the
actual
application
of
a
bias
mitigator
in
the
model
pipeline
and
the
fairness
implications,
this
would
add
weights
to
our
data
with
the
goal
of
achieving
a
disparate
impact
of
1
at
the
preprocessing
stage
or
before
any
actual
decision
making
is
done.
Here,
group
affiliation
and
fairness
is
taken
into
consideration
for
each
individual
prior
to
any
decision.
The
cost
of
a
false
negative
or
a
false
positive
in
this
case
would
most
likely
be
more
severe
for
our
unprivileged
class
but
we
have
found
that
there
did
not
seem
to
be
much
quantifiable
bias
in
our
model
results
against
the
unprivileged
class
to
begin
with.
However,
as
we
are
determining
our
classes
by
the
majority
population
in
the
flight
origin
and
destination,
the
bias
we
mitigated
through
reweighing
could
prove
to
still
be
beneficial
to
the
minority
populations
traveling
in
the
white
majority
cities
as
the
FarePerMile
in
general
would be lower.
Price Sensitivity Model
To
improve
accuracy
on
the
protected
group
compared
to
the
privilege
group,
reweighting
was
applied
to
the
protected
group
to
address
the
issue
of
bias.
As
a
result,
the
accuracy
of
the
protected
group
increased
from
.85
to
.9,
indicating
some
degree
of
bias
mitigation.
However,
the
accuracy
of
the
privilege
group
decreased
from
.97
to
.94.
It
is
important
to
note
that
the
accuracy
of
the
original
test
set
remained
unchanged,
indicating
that
oversampling
did
not
negatively
affect
the
generalizability
of
the
model.
The
oversampling
technique
represents
an
effort
to
promote
fairness
in
the
model’s
predictions
for
both the privilege and protected groups.
Since
the
oversampling
technique
work
reasonably
well
on
the
initial
model,
therefore,
we
decided
to
build
our
final
model
based
on
such
an
assumption.
Details
of
performance
of
the final model could be found on the website.
Conclusion
By
investigating
the
potential
bias
within
flight
ticket
pricing
models,
we
obtain
a
thorough
understanding
of
current
problems
within
this
complicated
system.
We
do
discover
correlations
between
pricing
differences
and
demographics.
Yet,
we
did
not
observe
evident
bias
with
respect
to
race
and
income
through
our
pricing
model
development.
Regardless,
we
utilize
fairness
metrics
and
bias
mitigation
methods
to
create
and
evaluate
a
model
that
is
both
accurate
and
unbiased.
And
we
believe
fairness
metrics,
like
Disparate
Impact,
would
serve
as
a
great
indicator
that
allows
consumers
to
understand
whether
they
are
price
discriminated
against
and
whether
they
are
paying
the
fair
price.
We
believe
our
findings
provide
inspiration
and
a
solid
foundation
for
the
next
step
of
discoveries,
where
the
flight
ticket
pricing
models
can
be
held
under
even
more
stringent
inspection
when
future
researchers
have
access
to
ticket
data
with
finer
details
or
more
advanced
computation
methods.
We
think
that
the
variation
of
price
sensitivity
between
privileged
and
underprivileged
groups
would
be
an
interesting
research
topic
that
builds
on
top
of
our
project.
We
expect
that
fair
pricing
models
should
result
in
similar
price
sensitivity
between
the
privileged
and
underprivileged
groups.
“Under
the
current
pricing
model,
do
underprivileged
groups
have
to
accept
limited
ranges
of
high
prices,
thus
having
lower
price
sensitivity
compared
to
the
privileged
groups?”
would
be
a
potential
question
to
ask
in
that
case.

Education on Earning
Huaning Liu, Noah Simpson, Xue Wang, Wenqian Zhao
March 2023
1 Abstract
Over the past few decades, thousands of studies have been focusing on investigating the rate of return to education.
Although a vast majority of them indicated a positive relationship between education level and income, social
scientists who are using traditional methods such as classification and regression trees (CART) and OLS have to be
meticulous to make inferences about their causal relationship and one of the big concerns is the omitted variables-
It is hard to tell whether higher education attainment causes somebody to earn more or the higher income is caused
by other factors such as the individual’s ability. In the traditional use of CART, such methods are used to predict
outcomes given a population and its covariates, typically with the ground truth for each observation already known.
However, when using CART for estimating causal effects rather than prediction when we have no knowledge about
the effect of the treatment, meaningful results become far more challenging to obtain, with bias and sparsity becoming
increasingly arduous to maneuver. This paper intends to estimate the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE)
of education level on earning using the “honest” estimator proposed in the paper Comprehension and Reproduction
of Recursive Partitioning for Heterogeneous Causal Effects , written by Susan Athey and Guido Imbens. The authors
created and benchmarked an unbiased estimator of CATE across subsets of the population with different treatments,
proposing an “honest” approach for estimation. An “honest” approach with CART involves using one sample to
construct partitions in the tree and using a separate sample to estimate the treatment effects, which removes spurious
correlations between the covariates and outcomes in the model. Therefore, we aim to apply this approach to get an
unbiased estimate of the CATE of college education on earnings.
2 Introduction
Education is widely considered as the cornerstone of personal and societal progress. It has the power to shape
individuals into well-rounded, informed citizens and provide them with the necessary skills to succeed in their personal
and professional lives. Moreover, education is a crucial factor in the development of a thriving and prosperous society.
From increasing economic growth to promoting civic engagement, education continues to be the key determinant of
success in various aspects of life, especially of the career prospects and high-status income level[26]. Economists have
started the investigation into the causal relationship between education attainments and income level in relatively
early years. In a research of human capital conducted by Gary Becker in 1963, he identified the return to education
as a central factor for labor market policy-making[6]. However, there are many challenges in terms of inferring the
causal effect of education on earnings, such as the inaccessibility of demographic profiles, the infeasibility of the
counterfactual potential outcomes, and the bias brought by the interference of other variables. To deal with those
challenges, we query the IPUMS database to get adequate demographic data and used the “honest” estimator in the
Causal Tree algorithm proposed by Susan Athey and Guido Imbens to get an unbiased estimation of the CATE.
2.1 Literature Review
Education vs. Income
The relationship between education attainment and income level has been a popular topic of discussion in academic
literature. A wide range of studies have been conducted to examine this relationship and the findings have been
illuminating. Albert E. Beaton’s study in 1975 revealed that individuals with more years of education and similar
aptitude, as measured by aptitude scores, tend to earn higher salaries on average within the sample population [5].
Sociologists and economists have reached a consensus regarding the connection between education and employment,
which can be summarized in two aspects. Firstly, individuals who have received more education have developed
1enhanced practical and interpersonal skills, which are directly linked to their promotion prospects and capacity
to perform their job duties effectively [12]. Secondly, these individuals will possess a higher socio-economic status
recognition by society, which provides them with greater access to prestigious employment opportunities[8].
However, a number of studies have also shown that other social factors can in some cases overshadow the effect
of education on income. Donna Bobbitt-Zeher’s research from 2007 uncovered a significant disparity in the annual
income of women compared to men with comparable educational backgrounds, with women earning approximately
$4,400 less per year[7]. This finding has motivated our investigation in this paper into the impact of education on
income disparities between different genders.
Causal Inference
The framework of Mincer’s Model provided a foundation for most of the recent studies of education and income
determination[24]:
logw=α+ρs+β1x+β2x2+e,
where wstands for wage, sstands for years of schooling, and xstands for years of experience. Studies have demon-
strated a positive and crucial role of education, especially high school and college, on one’s enhancement of social
economic status[2][20]. However, economists recognized that the correlation between years of education and income
obtained by OLS might not be the same as their causal effect due to other factors such as ability bias, so when
inferring causal relationships they have to be extra careful[10].
Angrist and Krueger used the quarter of birth in the U.S. as the instrumental variable for the OLS in their study of
the return to education. Due to the fact that students cannot enroll in the first grade by the age of 6 and cannot drop
out by the age of 17, they investigated the problem that whether differences in education determined by differences
in birthdays translate into differences in earnings. In doing so, they estimated the return on earnings per year of
education to be 0.102[1]. Harmon et al who similarly utilized the changes in the compulsory school attendance law as
instrumental variables for educational attainment estimated the returns to education to be 0.15 [19]. To remove the
bias brought by the correlation of other variables with education and income, Ashenfelter and Zimmerman utilized
family backgrounds such as parent and sibling education as a control to estimate the causal effect of education on
earning to be 0.08[3]. In their study of the causal effect of holding a GED(Graduate Equivalency Degree) on earnings
in the labor market for high school dropouts, Tyler et al. utilized the difference-in-difference method to control for
GED test scores and compare mean income for states with different standards for passing the GED. Their results
indicate a 10 to 19 increase in earnings for holding a GED certificate [21].
Within the area of causal inference, causal decision trees have been discussed and extended since its first proposal,
whose structures are continually being varied and optimized [23] [27]. Similar nonlinear tree-structured regression
algorithms are broadly studied under existing works, such as Bayesian regression trees, probability trees, and factor
modeling, etc [18] [14][13]. It is generally benefited from the advantages of tree algorithms, which could provide a
compact graphic, coupled with a typically low run-time [23]. The work we are investigating and replicating in this
paper examines such tree structure algorithms under heterogeneous causal effects cases, which is a large branch in
the causal inference that is consistently and increasingly studied [25] [16]. The proposed unbiased splitting criterion
and “honesty” accordingly fill in a blank of a population partitioning strategy in the decision tree algorithm and
further generalizes the use of regression trees in causal works.
2.2 Dataset
We gained our inspiration from the IPUMS database, which contains U.S. census microdata from around 1980 to
2020, with nearly trillions of pieces of data and thousands of features. Census data has been widely applied to studies
about the causal analysis of education on earnings- Dustmann and Sch¨ onberg used UK census data and J¨ antti and
Reinikka-Soininen used Vietnamese census data in their studies to estimate the causal effect of education on earnings,
controlling for various factors such as ability, family background, and occupation[11] [22]. One of the advantages of
using this kind of data is that the sample size will be large enough, so we don’t need to worry about the insufficiency
of data after cleaning and dropping null values. Upon checking, the data is fully available with an online database
query; therefore we queried the database and did simple data processing to attain the desired features and variables.
In past analyses, researchers tend to use demographic, occupational, and geographic features such as age, gen-
der, race, job type, and location as features for their causal study[1]. In Goldin and Katz’s study, they used a
regression analysis to estimate the returns to education, controlling for other factors that may affect earnings such as
occupation, age, and experience. They also compare the returns to education for different groups of individuals based
2on race, gender, and birthplace to examine differences in the labor market outcomes of these groups[15]. Therefore,
we would like to adopt similar feature-selection strategies to include features such as sex, state, and insurance status
to estimate the causal effect. We also want to compare the CATE across demographic groups to see the difference
like what Goldin and Katz did in their study.
3 Setup
3.1 Causal Effect
For every unit iinN, where i= 1,2, ..., N , there are two potential outcomes, denoted by:
(Yi(0), Y1(1))
τiis defined to be the unit-level difference in potential outcomes, denoted by:
τi=Yi(1)−Yi(0)
Wi∈ {0,1}is defined to be the indicator for whether unit ireceived the treatment or not. If Wi= 0: unit received
control; If Wi= 1: unit received treatment. For every unit iwe only have one of the previous values of Wobserved,
therefore Yobs
iis as follows:
Yobs
i=Yi(Wi) =Yi(0),ifWi= 0
Yi(1),ifWi= 1
The population average outcome for all covariates in a given partition of a tree is defined to be
µ(w, x; Π)≡E[Yi(w)|Xi∈l(x; Π)].
LetSwdenote the sample space for a specific treatment w, the unbiased estimator for the average outcome given a
partition Π and a sample space Sis defined as
ˆµ(w, x;S,Π)≡1
#(i∈Sw:Xi∈l(x; Π))X
i∈Sw:Xi∈l(x;Π)Yobs
i.
Given the average outcome, the CATE is defined as
τ(x; Π)≡E[Yi(1)−Yi(0)|Xi∈l(x; Π)] = µ(1, x; Π)−µ(0, x; Π)
the difference of the average outcome between the treatment and control group. Therefore, the unbiased estimator
for CATE is defined as
ˆτ(s;S,Π)≡ˆµ(1, x;S,Π)−ˆµ(1, x;S,Π),
the difference of the estimated average outcome for all covariates given a sample space Sand a partition Π between
the treatment and control group.
3.2 Methodology
In this section, we briefly review the two tree-based method to be practiced in this work.
Honest Tree
The ”honest” approach used for building and validating the Causal Tree is an extension and divergence from the
classification and regression trees(CART) algorithm.
Due to the fact that we cannot observe both Yi(1) and Yi(0) for an individual, the true treatment effect τis
also not observable since we are missing half of the Yobs. Thus, the ”honest” version of EMSE τ(Π):
EMSE τ(Π)≡ESte,Sest[MSE τ(Ste, Sest,Π)]
is not feasible as we have no knowledge about τi. Therefore, the paper proposed an estimator for EMSE τ(Π) by
modifying the MSE µin CART to get an unbiased estimator \MSE τfor the treatment effect and the EMSE τ(Π) in
3”honest” algorithm to get an unbiased estimator \EMSE τ(Str, Nest,Π) for EMSE τ(Π).
Letpdenote the proportion of the treated individuals in a leaf, Str
control denote the subsample of the control group
in the training sample, and Str
treat denote the subsample of the treatment group in the training sample, the unbiased
estimator for EMSE τ(Π) for splitting is defined as
−\EMSE τ(Str, Nest,Π)≡1
NtrX
i∈Strˆτ2(Xi;Str,Π)−(1
Ntr+1
Nest)·X
l∈Π(S2
Str

Str
control(l)
1−p).
Using the same equation as the splitting criterion with cross-validation sample, the unbiased estimator of EMSE τ(Π)
for cross-validation is −\EMSE τ(Str,cv, Nest,Π).
Generalization to Random Forests
Breiman [9] first proposed the idea of growing random forest via bootstrap aggregation from decision trees on
randomized subsamples. It is primarily defined on the setting of ( Xi, Yi)∈χ×Rtowards the estimation of
µ(x) =E[Yi|X=xi]. Then for training set {Xi, Wi, Yi}n
i=1, a proportion p∈(0,1] fixed, we did the following
two steps iteratively Ktimes: for kth iteration, 1. draw a subset from the training set by proportion pwith replace-
ment, denote it to be Zk2. build an honest tree based on Zk, denote it to be hk(·). This process gives us a collection
of honest trees, say {hi}K
i=1. Then considering an observation in the test set ( Xi, Wi), we predict it on these Ktrees
separately and take an average to derive the prediction result for treatment effect.
Note that the algorithm above takes a deviation from Athey et al. work on generalizing random forest [4], that
we simplified the authors’ setting to be a simple bootstrap. Still, in the empirical application part, we employed the
”grf” library they offered for lower computation cost.
3.3 Dataset Description
Query & Covariates Extraction
We will utilize the US census data to investigate the impact of college completion on yearly income. Specifically, we
have transformed the education level variable (EDUC), which ranges from 0 to 11, into a binary variable with a value
of 1 if the level is equal to 10, indicating college completion, and 0 for individuals with level of 6. We also discarded
observations with age less than 30 to make sure most individuals has completed their terminal degree by the time
taking this survey, in order to consolidate the binarity of treatments. This transformed variable is denoted as the
treatment variable Wi. Furthermore, we have logarithmically transformed the income level variable (INCWAGE)
to serve as our outcome variable Y. This transformation is necessary due to the typically skewed nature of income
distributions and the tendency for income variance to increase with income level, leading to heteroscedasticity [17].
By taking the logarithm of income, the data is more amenable to our analysis as the skewness is reduced, and variance
is stabilized. We also consider other demographic variables such as gender (SEX), age (AGE), and race (RACE) as
candidates of covariates.
Further Processing & Missing Data
The census data being used was very clean; there were almost no missing values, only some being found in the
INCWAGE/AGE categories. We looked only at ages from 30-65, eliminating outliers, and also to be more confident
that those in the census who have a high school or college education were done with schooling. We also deem
retired wages above 65 to be unimportant and potentially biased in our treatment effect, as there are many different
financial mechanisms that occur in retirement that influence yearly wage. Missing values in INCWAGE were also
removed. Consider the variable race, sex and state to be categorical in the raw tabular data, we use one-hot encoder
to encode them into matrix with binary entries to erase the ordinality within data that might affect the regression
and cause bias. Therefore, we process and extract such covariates, denoted to be {Xi}following the setting above,
with a column dimension of around 40 since some states are not included. In light of computational limitations,
we constrained our data analysis to a subset of 5 million raw observations drawn from the IPUMS database, out of
which we ultimately retained a sample of 1 million processed data points. To mitigate any potential sampling bias,
we executed a purely random query process to ensure that our sub-sample constituted an unbiased representation of
the population data, thus facilitating our analysis.
Problem of Interest
To further our study into specific research problems, several datasets are created, but all datasets more or less utilize
4the same covariates. First, we investigated the effect of college on income for several different years, being 2010, 2000,
and 1990. All three datasets utilize the same variables, and none of the sets contain any missing values. Second, we
investigated the effect of college on income for males and females. We split these datasets up, so the sex covariate
was dropped from both. Neither contain any missing values, and both groups attend college at approximately the
same rate. Further, only data from 2010 is used. Lastly, we investigated the effect of college on yearly income for
different age groups, being people in their 30s, 40s, and 50s. Again, except the problem that compares the decades,
the other two datasets were both taken from 2010 real data.
The variables being used are as follows in Table [1]:
Variable Type Description
AGE Covariate Age of individual, ranging from 30 to 65.
SEX Covariate Sex of individual, encoded as 1 for male and 0 for female.
RACE Covariate Race of individual, one hot encoded from a range of 1 to 9. Legend
in appendix.
STATEFIP Covariate State FIPS code, one hot encoded from 1 to 56. Legend in ap-
pendix.
HCOVANY Covariate Whether an individual has any form of healthcare, encoded as 1
for yes and 0 for no.
EDUC Treatment Whether an individual has completed college education or com-
pleted high school education, encoded as 1 for college and 0 for
high school. This is the observed treatment.
INCWAGE Outcome Log of the yearly wage of an individual.
Table 1: Variable(raw Covariate) Description
3.4 Exploratory Data Analysis
In order to get a more general sense, we plotted the distribution of variables that are relevant to our research problems.
The analysis of Figure 1 reveals that there are no discernible variations in the logged mean annual income be-
tween different age cohorts in 2010. It is noteworthy, however, that the elderly group exhibits marginally higher
mean income, although this difference is inconspicuous on account of the utilization of a logarithmic scale. Addition-
ally, the 3D scatter plot highlights that individuals in their thirties and seventies tend to have the lowest income,
which corroborates the veracity of the notion that individuals who are entering or exiting the labor market typically
earn a lower income.
Figure 1: (log)Wages in Different Ages
 Figure 2: 3D Scatterplot of Education Level
v.s. (log)Wage vs. Age
Figure 3 presents a conspicuous distinction in the proportion of individuals who received a college education across
various age cohorts in 2010. Notably, the older age groups exhibit lower rates of college attendance. As a result,
5we seek to ascertain whether a difference exists in the conditional average treatment effect of education on earnings
between individuals belonging to different age categories.
Based on the findings presented in Figure 4, it is apparent that there exists a variation in the logged mean an-
nual income throughout different decades, indicating a tendency towards increased income in later years. In light of
this observation, we are inclined to investigate whether there are any dissimilarities in the CATE of education on
earnings across the various decades.

4 Honest Tree Results
4.1 Training and Testing Details
Focusing on the three problems of interest above, we extend the practical application to tree-based method discussed
in 3.2, and present the CATE estimation on each leaf. In this case, we are interested in the visualization of the
trees with respect to each of the subgroups proposed by the three questions of interest above. Related visualizations
and tables will be presented below. We are sampling a training set of size 50 ,000with no replacement and another
testing set of size 5 ,000 from the database (processed and encoded).
4.2 CATE across decades
The first problem of interest focuses on the conditional average treatment effect of college education on yearly wages
in the years 1990, 2000, and 2010. Our objective is to examine the variation in CATE estimates over time (decades).
Our analysis reveals that deeper trees and larger CATE estimates are produced in the later decades. Specifically,
the CATE estimation across leaves for the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s are 0.7723, 0.547, and 0.481, respectively. This
finding suggests a decreasing trend in the impact of college education on income over time. The results of this study
contribute to the literature on the relationship between education and income and provide insights for policymakers
and educators.

4.3 CATE across ages
This second problem of interest aims to investigate the conditional average treatment effect of college education
on yearly wages for individuals in different age intervals. Specifically, we divided our sample into three groups:
individuals aged between 30 to 40, 40 to 50, and 50 to 60. We utilized data from 2010 to ensure the latest possible
data availability. Our analysis shows that younger age groups exhibit higher tree depth and higher estimated CATE
than the older ones. Nonetheless, the differences in CATE estimates across age groups are less pronounced than
those observed across decades. The average CATE estimate for individuals in their 30s, 40s, and 50s is 0.74, 0.679,
and 0.645, respectively. These results indicate a decreasing trend in the effect of college education on income as
individuals get older. These findings may provide valuable insights for policymakers and educators concerning the
importance of college education in terms of its impact on income among different age groups.

4.4 CATE by genders
Our last problem of interest aims to examine the conditional average treatment effect of college education on yearly
wages for males and females. We similarly utilized data from 2010 for the latest possible data availability. Our
analysis shows no significant variation in tree depth or CATE estimates by gender. The average CATE estimate for
males and females in 2010 is 0.556 and 0.546, respectively. These results suggest that college education has a similar
impact on income for both males and females.

5 Forest method vs. Honest Tree
5.1 Training and Testing Details
Focusing on the three problems of interest above, we extend the practical application to forest-based method discussed
in 3.2, and draw a comparison with its predicted treatment effects with the one from the tree. Given the number of
trees as the only non-adaptive parameters in the random forest algorithm, we trained two models with 100 and 200
trees, and compare the mean and standard deviation of predicted treatment effects with the output from a single
honest tree. Furthermore, we horizontally compare the forest-predicted CATE among the subgroups specified in the
problems of interests. Empirically, for the inputted data, we sampled 50 ,000 observations from the database as the
training set with no replacement , and sampled another 5 ,000 observations from the database as the test set (processed
and encoded). Note that unlike in simulations or an experiment, so individuals do not undergo both treatments, and
consequently we are unable to take the difference between the two treatments on the same individual i.e. the ”true”
individualized treatment effects. Therefore, the results are presented mostly for the purpose of CATE comparison
based on our questions of interest.
5.2 CATE across decades
In Figure [13], we employed a fixed causal forest model with 100 trees to predict the conditional average treatment
effects on a test set for each decade. Our analysis revealed that the predicted treatment effects did not exhibit
substantial deviations across the decades. However, there were several outliers in the predicted values for the 2000s,
which we attributed to the volatile global economic conditions during that period, including the emergence of global
diseases and financial crises. Notably, our findings demonstrated an overall increasing trend in the treatment effects
9higher educations on earnings by decades, indicating an escalating demand for individuals with higher education in
the job market, resulting in higher salaries for this group.
Turning to Table [5], we compared the distribution of predicted CATEs for three causal tree-based methods.
We found no significant difference between the predicted CATE values of the forest model with 100 trees and the
forest model with 200 trees. However, we observed a higher standard deviation in the predicted treatment effects
from the honest tree method relative to the other two methods. This result suggests that ensembled models offer
better stability compared to single-tree models. We emphasize that the choice of model and its hyperparameters can
significantly affect the stability and performance of the model, highlighting the importance of careful selection and
tuning of models for causal inference.

Table 5: prediction CATE variability and ATE on test set
5.3 CATE across ages
In Figure [14], we observed a decreasing trend in the predicted treatment effects as the age of the population increased,
as shown by the boxplots. This trend may be attributed to the decreasing demand for college graduates in the job
market among the sub-population aged 50+ who have completed their advanced degrees. Our findings align with
the analysis presented in section 5.2.
Examining Table [6], we observed a significantly larger standard deviation for the honest tree method compared
to the other two methods. This result reinforces our previous finding that ensembled models, such as random forests,
offer higher robustness with the bagging technique. Furthermore, we observed that the CATE estimated by the
honest tree method tended to be higher than those estimated by the forest models, consistent with our previous
findings. We note that the selection of model and hyperparameters can significantly impact the performance and
stability of the model, underscoring the importance of careful consideration in the model selection process for causal
inference.

Table 6: prediction CATE variability and ATE on testset
5.4 CATE across genders
In Figure [15], we observed that the estimated treatment effects for males were higher than those for females, as
evidenced by the boxplot. This finding suggests that obtaining a higher level of education leads to greater rewards
for males than for females. This observation aligns with the well-documented career inequality due to gender in the
United States, resulting in women receiving fewer benefits from education than men. Interestingly, we observed a
greater number of outliers for females compared to males. This may be indicative of a large social class deviation
among females, whereby girls from families with lower income or social status face even higher risks in investing in
education. These findings underscore the need for policies and interventions that address the persistent gender and
socio-economic disparities in education and the workforce.
In Table [7], we observed an unusually lower estimated average treatment effect for the honest tree method, which
is in contrast to our findings in the previous sections. This result further underscores the fact that random forests
tend to produce more robust estimates, while causal trees may yield CATE estimates with greater instability.

6 Continued discussion & Summary
In sections 4 and 5, we addressed three important problems in the context of causal inference and summarized
and visualized the estimated conditional average treatment effects within subpopulations using both the honest tree
method and the causal forest algorithm. Our analysis revealed that the data became more complex in recent decades,
as the tree was grown deeper with the inclusion of the 2010 data, compared to the 1990 data. This suggests that
recent-year cohorts face more choices and challenges in the job market. Additionally, we found that trees for samples
of individuals in their 30s were grown deeper, which is consistent with our previous conclusion that higher education
is becoming increasingly important for job market success. Our analysis also showed that higher education had a
greater impact on the earnings of young people compared to middle-aged individuals, as evidenced by the boxplots
in section 5.
But there are also factors to be considered other than the finite covariates we involved. Another possible explanation
for the higher treatment effects on earning in recent years will be the impact of economic and monetary changes on
the data. Over the past several years, the global economy has experienced several recessions, and this has had a
significant impact on many industries and individuals. For example, the value of the dollar has depreciated, which
could have affected the data we collected. It’s possible that this depreciation could have led to changes in purchasing
power, which could have influenced the results of our analysis. Additionally, the recession could have led to changes
in employment rates or income levels, which could have had an impact on the variables we studied.
In this research, we conducted a comparative analysis of various causal tree-based techniques and observed that the
causal forest approach, as an ensemble method, was inclined towards producing more consistent predictions compared
to those generated by an individual honest tree. Our findings highlight the criticality of selecting appropriate models
and methods for performing causal inference analyses. In situations where the data are complex, and the number
of confounding factors is substantial, ensemble methods such as the causal forest algorithm may yield more robust
outcomes. Furthermore, it is essential to meticulously consider the hyperparameters of the chosen method to optimize
12its performance. However, it is pertinent to acknowledge the trade-off between time and performance when comparing
ensemble methods and plain techniques. Our research involved an extensive training procedure during random forest
analysis, and the training time for a single tree was already significant. Therefore, our group is excited about the
algorithmic acceleration or more informative trees is the subsequent stage of this study in the future study of causal
inference. While the former involves a more computer science oriented approach, the latter leans more heavily on
the contributions of mathematicians and economists.

Abstract
Recommender systems have emerged as a simple yet powerful framework for
the suggestion of relevant items to users. However, a potential issue arises when
recommender systems overly recommend or spam undesired products to users in
which the model loses the trust of the user. We propose a constrained bandit-based
recommender system. We show this model outperforms Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) and Thompson sampling in terms of expected regret and does not lose the
trust of the users.
1 Introduction
In recent years, online platforms and marketplaces have developed the capacity to host and sell a
large variety of products and services across a wide range of industries. With this vast amount of
products that are projected to exponentially grow, users have relied on and continue to rely on the
platforms’ recommendation system to aid in the decision making process. Some popular examples
include Netflix for movie and TV show recommendations, and Yelp for restaurants, among others.
The success of the recommender system (and subsequently the platform’s success) is dependent on
the quality of recommendations given out to users. When a product has a good track record and its
quality is known beforehand, it is relatively easy to make a recommendation. Ideally, a system would
maximize “good” products’ recommendations, and minimize “bad” products’ recommendations.
However, a common problem arises when the system has little to no information about a new product.
This challenge is known as the “cold start” problem and many new/ niche products fail to overcome
it. It is up to the recommender system to balance how much time is spent on exploration (to gather
information on how the product fares) and exploitation (to maximize the reward). Initially exploring
too much, or “spamming” the user can have the negative consequence of users losing trust in the
recommender system as a result of receiving a lot of ill-suited recommendations. This problem can
be modeled using a multi-armed bandit framework. In this setting, the available actions are products
that can be chosen by the user. There are many bandit algorithms that have their own unique method
of balancing exploration and exploitation. In this project, our goal is to develop a recommender
system that outperforms popular asymptotic bandit algorithms while maintaining the recommender’s
credibility.
In many previous works, many multi-armed bandit algorithms (MABs) have been utilized for
recommender systems. These algorithms have been rigorously studied, and we referenced the
algorithms and the intuition behind them in the work by Lattimore and Szepesvári [ 2]. In this,
they highlight the pros and cons of a collection of bandit algorithms including Upper Confidence
Bound, Thompson Sampling, and Bayesian Optimal Policy, etc. For our project, we compared
the performances of these algorithms, and decided on the standard Bayesian Optimal Policy for
the implementation. Additionally, we looked to existing literature on the development of fair and
trustworthy recommender systems. Our project draws heavily on research from Che and Hörner [ 1].
DSC 180 Capstone Project Section B17In their study, they discuss a similar problem of needing to discover an optimal recommendation
policy that does not lose user trust. Some key insights include the idea that spamming can be a way
to promote early exploration. However, excessive spamming can backfire and harm the credibility of
the recommender. A solution they propose is to start small and spam over a longer duration. Further,
they also discuss how alternate avenues of gathering information such as product research can aid in
developing credibility and can act as a substitute for costly exploration. In the context of this project,
we adopt a similar approach that spams to a fraction of agents over time with the intent of maintaining
credibility.
This report is divided into a few main sections. First, we formulate the bandit environment in our
recommendation setting and how we assess trustworthiness. Next, we show how our bandit policy
of choice: Bayesian Optimal Policy outperforms popular bandit algorithms: UCB and Thompson
sampling. Lastly, we show how our constrained bandit model utilizing Bayesian Optimal Policy does
not lose the trust of the users in our recommender system setting.
2 Methods
2.1 Setting
The setting for our bandit problem is as follows. Suppose a product with unknown quality and reward
ωis released at time t= 0, and an infinite number of agents or users arrives at each time t >0. We
are interested in understanding whether to recommend this unknown product or a known product
with some constant reward c. We define the quality of the unknown product as good if ϕ= 1or bad
ifϕ= 0. The model is given some prior p0, defined to be the probability that the unknown product is
good (ϕ= 1) where p0∈[0,1]. At time t= 0, the model receives a signal σ∈ {g, n}(grefers to
good news, nrefers to no news) about the quality of the product with probabilities:
P(σ=g|ϕ) =ρifϕ= 1
0ifϕ= 0(1)
for some constant ρ∈[0,1]and where g(n)refers to the model receiving good (no) news/signal.
Thus the designer can receive good or no news if the product is good, but will only receive no news if
the product is bad. For time t >0, the signal received by the model is determined as:
P(σ=g|ϕ) =αtifϕ= 1
0 ifϕ= 0(2)
For some αt∈[0,1]. If at some time t∗good news is received ( σ=g), then the model will
permanently recommend the product to all agents for t≥t∗(αt= 1). Otherwise, the model will
recommend the product to a fraction αtof the incoming agents at time t. Furthermore, ptis defined
to be the ""no news"" posterior where we receive no news. This is defined to be:
p0=(
1 ifσ0=g
(1−ρ)·p0
(1−ρ)·p0+(1−p0)ifσ0=n(3)
and
pt+1=(
1 ifσt=g
(1−ραt)pt
(1−ραt)pt+(1−pt)ifσt=n(4)
for all t >0.
We can represent this problem as a one-armed bandit setting. In this case, the stochastic arm
represents our unknown product with reward Bernoulli distributed and p=ραtand the deterministic
arm represents our known product with constant reward c.
22.2 Trustworthiness
In our model, agents are unaware of the information given only to the model. Thus, agents will form
a rational belief about the model’s prediction and act accordingly. Suppose gtis the probability the
model has received good news by time t. Then by the martingale property, we define gtas:
gt=p0−pt
1−pt(5)
Thus, our agents will become increasingly pessimistic about the quality of the unknown product as
time progresses with the lack of good news. This can be observed there the inverse relationship of gt
andpt. In addition, each agent will have some incentives for following the recommendation based
off of their beliefs of the model’s recommendation qt(pt)defined as:
qt(pt) =gt+ (1−gt)αtpt
gt+ (1−gt)αt(6)
Therefore, an agent will only consume the unknown product if and only if their incentive to consume
the unknown product is greater than the cost, or the reward of the known product:
qt(pt)≥c (7)
We describe the case in which there exists some time tsuch that qt(pt)< cas the model losing the
trust of the user. This leads us to define a trustworthy recommender system in this setting as a model
which satisfies equation ( 7) for all t.
2.3 Models
Based on the bandit setting, we have two very similar models. Both models determine the best policy
through the Bayesian Optimal Policy. In this case, ωis defined as:
ωt
αt(pt) =rα∗+ωt+1(pt+1) (8)
where ris defined as:
r= (1−c)pt+ (−c)(1−pt) +ρptωt+1(1)−ρptωt+1(pt+1) (9)
We define ωt
αt(1)as:
ωt
αt(1) = (1 −c)(n−t−1) (10)
andωn+1
αn+1(pn+1) = 0 for all pn+1. We then use backwards induction to calculate all values of
ωt
αt(pt). Due to the peculiar nature of our bandit setting, both models will use a variation of the
retirement policy where we continuously pull the unknown/stochastic arm until we lose confidence
and then permanently pull the deterministic arm. We add in an additional retirement case where
if we receive good news at some time t∗(σ=g) then αt= 1 and we permanently pull the
unknown/stochastic arm.
The key difference between the two models is the determination of α∗. In our first best policy, we
recommend the unknown product to all agents regardless of the signal we receive. Thus, α∗
FBis
defined as:
α∗
FB=1ifr >0
0ifr <0(11)
In our second best policy, we only recommend the unknown product to some fraction αtof all users
at time tif we received no news by then. Thus α∗
SBis defined as:
3α∗
SB=αtifr >0
0 ifr <0(12)
where αtis equal to:
αt= min
1,(1−c)(p0−pt)
(1−p0)(c−pt)
(13)
3 Experiments
3.1 Policy Comparison
In this experiment, we compare the expected regret of the Bayesian Optimal Policy to popular
asymptotically optimal bandit algorithms UCB and Thompson Sampling in the one-armed bandit
setting. All algorithm descriptions and equations are shown in the supplementary section. In this
case, the stochastic arm has a reward bernoulli distributed with some p∈[0,1]and the deterministic
arm has a constant reward of 0.5. We set the priors for the density estimation variant of Bayesian
Optimal Policy as well as Thompson Sampling to be beta distributed with α= 1andβ= 1. We
plotted the expected regret for all values of pfrom [0,1]for all algorithms below in figure 1. We
observe both variants of the Bayesian Optimal Policy outperform Thompson Sampling and UCB.

3.2 Trustworthy Recommender Systems
In the second experiment, we compare how αchanges within our recommender system problem
setting. Here, we initialized {p0, ρ, c, n }={1
2,1
4,2
3,1000}. In figure 2, we plot how αtversus t
across both polices. We observe that our first best policy spams to all agents and then immediately
stops recommending the product. This is because our first best policy violates equation ( 7) where the
agents lose the trust of the policy due to over recommendation of the unknown product. However, we
observe a different case in our second best policy where the model only recommends the product
to a fraction of the agents. Gradually, this fraction increases until the model loses confidence in the
unknown product and stop recommending it. In this case, equation 7 is satisfied for all tand as a
result, the policy does not lose the trust of the consumers.

In this report, we have shown how the Bayesian Optimal Policy outperforms popular asymptotically
optimal algorithms such as Upper Bound Confidence and Thompson Sampling. We have also shown

5A Supplementary Information
A.1 Bandit Problems
Abandit problem is a sequential game between a learner and a environment [2]. The game is
played over nrounds, where nis called the horizon . At round t∈[1, n], the learner selects an action
Atfrom a set of possible actions A. The actions here is often mentioned as the arms . Subsequently,
the environment would provide a reward Xt∈R. If the bandit environment is stochastic, the
reward provided with each action is not deterministic. Instead, it would follow a certain probability
distribution.
Under such a framework, the goal of the learner is to maximize the cumulative rewardPn
t=1Xtit
receives by choosing the action with the highest reward.
To achieve such goal, the learner would have a policy π, which is a algorithm mapping from its
observed history Ht−1= (A1, X1, A2, X2, . . . , A t−1, Xt−1)to its actions.
In order to evaluate the performance of a learner, one could look at the measurement of the learner’s
policy regret Rn:
Rn=nmax
a∈Aµa−E""nX
t=1Xt#
(14)
In plain words, regret is the difference between the cumulative rewards obtained through optimal
action and the expected cumulative reward obtained through the learner’s policy. A smaller regret
would correspond to a better-performing policy.
A.2 Exploration vs. Exploitation
One core trade-off in the study of multi-armed bandit is exploration vs. exploitation. At any given
round, the learner essentially has two options to take: either take some potentially sub-optimal actions
or choose the action with the maximum empirical mean reward.
Both options have their pros and cons. If the learner explores too much, then the learner would be
wasting much time even if the learner already has a good sense of the distributions of rewards for
each arm. If the learner exploits too early, it may unaware of the possibility of better actions.
Thus, the study of multi-armed bandit is finding an algorithm with a good balance of exploration
and exploitation. The remaining subsections in this section will highlight some of the well-known
algorithms for this purpose.
In this project, we aim to examine the performance of several bandit algorithms by analyzing the
regrets of these policies under specific settings.
A.3 Environment
To test our algorithm, we used a one-armed Bayesian bandit environment. This setting involved 2
arms, one with a known deterministic reward of 1/2, and the other following an unknown Bernoulli
distribution. Because we were testing the Bayesian Optimal Policy (see next section), the environment
also included a Beta prior of Q= Beta( α, β). Our horizon was set to n= 1000 . We chose 20
different parameters for the value of the unknown arm, ranging from 0 to 1. Each parameter was run
under these settings and simulated 1000 times. For each simulation, the regret was recorded and after
all simulations, the average regret and variance were calculated.
A.4 Upper Confidence Bound Algorithm
The UCB algorithm operates on the core principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty. For bandits,
this means that exploration of unknown arms is favored. In each round, an upper confidence bound is
calculated for each arm using the observed data. There are various methods to calculate the upper
confidence bound, and this difference is what creates multiple variants of the UCB algorithm. For
example, the upper confidence bound for a simple version: UCB( δ) takes in an error probability δ.
6UCB i(t−1, δ) =(
∞ ifTi(t−1) = 0
ˆµi(t−1) +q
2 log(1 /δ)
Ti(t−1)otherwise(15)
In the beginning, the upper confidence bound for each round is set to infinity. Then, each arm is
pulled once and the reward is observed to calculate the empirical mean. From here, the algorithm
continues and chooses the arm with the higher confidence bound and discovers the optimal arm in
this process.
The general UCB algorithm is defined as:
Algorithm 1 Upper Confidence Bound
Input k
fort∈1,2, . . . , n do
At←argmaxiUCB i(t−1)
UCB(t) ←Xt
end for
A.5 Thompson Sampling
Thompson sampling is a family of algorithms that uses a prior distribution before estimating the
expectation for each arm. After defining the priors for each arm, a posterior distribution of the
reward is calculated with the prior and the observed reward. A choice of conjugate priors aids in the
computation of the posterior in each round.
A.5.1 Bernoulli Arms
In a Bernoulli setting, the family of Beta distributions is conjugate, and the computation of the
posterior given the observed reward is also a beta distribution. Given a prior distribution Beta( α, β),
the posterior distribution would be Beta( α+x, β+ 1−x), where x∈ {0,1}is the reward the agent
receives for the round.
A.6 Gaussian Arms
For the Gaussian case, the posterior update is calculated using the signal and prior variance in
conjunction with the observed reward.
Q(·|x) =N 
µP/σ2
P+x/σ2
1/σ2
P+ 1/σ2,1

Pick action At←argmaxi∈[k]ˆθi
end for
The performance of the UCB and Thompson Sampling algorithms will serve as a baseline for the
focus of our project: Bayesian Optimal Policy .
7A.7 Bayesian Optimal Policy
In this project, we attempted to modify and potentially improve the Bayesian Optimal Policy (BOP)
for certain circumstances. The BOP takes into account a prior beta distribution as well as the reward
and number of pulls for each arm to determine the optimal action at each round. In our environment,
because the behavior of one of the arms is known, the policy comes down to exploring the unknown
arm until the known arm yields a better reward. Since the posterior distribution is calculated based
on the results of the action of the pulled arm, we know that the posterior of the action at the last
round will be 0, since there are no more rounds after. Thus, we can derive our optimal expected
cumulative reward backward, and then iterate forwards based on the results of our empirical reward
and number of pulls. The posterior at the start of a given round is Beta( α+St, β+t−1−St), with
St=Pt−1
s=1Zs. If we let pt(s) = (α+s)/(α+β+t−1), then:
E[Zt|Ft] =α+St
α+β+t−1=pt(St) (17)
P(St+1=St+ 1|St) =pt(St) (18)
P(St+1=St|St) = 1−pt(St) (19)
Thus, the optimal expected cumulative reward is as follows:
wt(s) = max ( n−t+ 1)µ2, pt(s) +pt(s)wt+1(s+ 1) + (1 −pt(s))wt+1(s) (20)
This policy, while more computationally expensive, yields a higher reward and lower regret than the
aforementioned baselines.

A.8 Density Estimation
Originally, the BOP is a density estimation problem that involves updating the preset prior probability
based on the results of the reward of the pulled arm at a given round. This BOP algorithm is as
follows:
max
π={πj}R(π) =EnX
j=iZ
EµAj(νj)ρj(ν)d(ν) (21)
8A.9 Point Estimation
The modification we are making is to use point estimation, which uses the empirical reward from all
previous rounds to calculate the probabilities for the next round, instead of the prior and posterior
distributions. Specifically, the policy uses skandqk, which denote the cumulative reward and the
number of times pulled for a given arm k, respectively. The utilization of skandqkwould essentially
replace the sampling of the prior and updating of the posterior. Thus, for our version, a prior is not
required. This policy maximizes the reward as defined by:
max
π={πj}R(π) =EnX
j=iµAj(ˆνj) (22)
In this equation, µAj(ˆνj), in terms of skandqk, can be rewritten as:
µAj(ˆνj) =sAj
qAj(23)
At a given round, the optimal expected cumulative reward from round i would be the max of the
calculations of wi(s, q)for both arms. The equations for both arms is as follows:
wi
2(s, q) =1
2+wi+1(s, q), wi
1(s, q) =s
q+s
awi+1(s+ 1, q+ 1) + (1 −s

Abstract
For this project, the one large topic we want to address is gun control. In recent years in
the United States, there have been an outburst of several horrific events as a result of guns
getting in the hands of the wrong people. In 2023, the number of mass shootings in the US
has already reached triple digits. With these incidents, we believe it would be an interesting
study to do further research into the sentiment and beliefs that people have toward these
issues and study this using automation and machine learning. Twitter is a very vocal platform
and with the use of our new knowledge regarding sentiment analysis, there are possibly very
many interesting discoveries to be made, such as how user sentiment toward one topic may
differ from another. We hypothesize that because of the many gruesome events that have
occurred in recent years, we will observe a mostly positive sentiment toward gun control, in
that people support more regulation of weapon distribution rather than less. Our proposed
project period of 10 weeks can be attributed to the fact that we are looking to improve upon
our previous work by expanding our knowledge on the Astra Streaming features, and working
on more efficient implementation of our architecture to ensure that we receive enough data for
sufficient analysis. We will also look to go further by integrating new features into our project,
including displaying results from our visualizations on a website in addition to streaming data
to a feature store or database. As we work towards these goals, we recognize that we may
come across technical issues that may require us to be more flexible and adjust our project
structure, so we would like to stay open minded in regards to what additional features will be
added.
1. Introduction
In this ever growing period of chaos where gun violence seems to be spiraling out of control, it
is important to consider the opinions of people who live in cities and communities affected by this
epidemic. There is most likely no solution that would make everyone happy, but through sentiment
analysis, the general opinions can be deduced and even used to influence these impactful decisions.
Twitter is a microblogging and social media platform that has amassed an enormous platform of
around 206 million daily active users that account for approximately 500 million tweets per day.
This popularity can be attributed to the fact that users feel enabled to talk freely about virtually
anything they want, including their daily lives or topics that they are passionate about. With
this kind of presence, it is only natural that the controversial topic of gun control became a huge
subject matter due to recent tragic events. Through sentiment analysis and the chosen machine
learning models, the collected Tweets will be classified as either positive, negative, or neutral and
through a majority voting manner, the common view will be identified.
Previous research has worked towards this goal as well but several studies encountered short-
comingsasaresultofthemethodsthatwereutilized. InonesuchstudydonebyKaur[2], sentiment
1analysis was performed using a deep learning algorithm that designed a hybrid heterogeneous sup-
port vector machine. The limitation of this model was that it was not as effective for Tweets in
different languages. Chakraborty [3] used the LSTM model on two types of rated Tweets, but some
issues that were encountered included that it failed to find the most common words for polarity
analysis and it was not able to reach the preferred validation accuracy with the given data. In
this paper, the data goes through extraction, preprocessing, and classification so as to avoid these
limitations. By taking the Twitter data from both the present and the time of the pandemic, this
paper will also provide conclusions about the opinions from these two different periods to examine
any differences. It is important that data is collected from both of these times as it is hypothesized
that the sentiment towards gun control would be different during a time when events such as mass
shootings were down compared to when there was a large spike in them.
The sample that will be used comes directly from the Twitter API. A Twitter firehose will be
connected to a Pulsar Topic in DataStax Astra. The topic is then transformed with one Pulsar
Function and the output is written to a second Pulsar Topic. Data will first be transformed using
a Python script and then a machine learning model will be applied to measure sentiment and
produce real-time analytics. This study will focus on gun control sentiment in the United States,
so Twitter data will be filtered accordingly. Another important filter will be the time frame as we
want to focus on Tweets from the time of the pandemic to now. Filtering in such a way makes
the data suitable for the goal of this paper as this helps us target a certain area of Tweets while
keeping a large enough dataset. Additionally, another part of the data that will be important in
our analysis would be the labels that we choose to give our data. We could use this data along
with TF-IDF and/or Word Embedding methods to figure out whether the particular data analyzed
belongs to a positive, negative or neutral sentiment label.
Figure 1. Pipeline Architecture
2. Methods
To live-stream our Twitter data, there were a wide variety of techniques to access Tweets in
real time from the Twitter API. After thorough research of these techniques, we decided to use
Tweepy, a well-documented python library with streaming and filtering capabilities that seemed
like it would be a perfect fit in the scope of our project. The second crucial portion for developing
the architecture of the project was setting up a streaming platform for the Tweets to be sent
to for preprocessing and further analysis. For this portion, we chose to use Astra Streaming in
conjunction with Pulsar, a pay-as-you go streaming service, which had three capabilities we needed
to continue – the ability to handle input code to receive raw Tweet data as a consumer, pass this
data through to a function to handle data preprocessing, and finally consume the final Tweets and
apply a machine learning model to receive the sentiment of the message.
Togofurtherindepth,ourstreamingarchitecturestartedwithTweepy,withthemainstreaming
capabilities coming from Tweepy’s StreamingClient Class. This class allowed for the raw tweets
to be taken in from Twitter in real time. From here, we implemented the streaming class into our
producer code, which produced the Tweets in real-time, and sent them to our Astra input topic.
Instead of running our producer code directly from the producer file, we chose to implement a sort
of “runner” file which created an instance of the producer class as well as the Tweepy streaming
2class, added preliminary filters which got certain keywords we wanted within our queries, as well as
removing Tweets with unnecessary media, tags, etc. This file was responsible for sending the tweets
to our input topic. The next part of our streaming architecture is the function, which reads the
tweets from input topic, and within our specific function, applied a regex to remove all links from
the tweets we wanted to pull. From the function, the tweets would be passed to our output topic,
ultimately to be read by our consumer. Within our consumer code, we feed in our processed Tweets
to our pre-trained Natural Language Processing (NLP) model adapted from HuggingFace, which
outputs a score and label based on the sentiment of the Tweet being negative, positive, or neutral.
This model, called twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest by Cardiff NLP, has been trained on over
124 million tweets, and has been adjusted for sentiment analysis with the TweetEval benchmark.
We decided to choose this model for our analysis as this model was specifically trained to analyze
sentiments from tweets, which was the backbone of our analysis. With these sentiments, we chose
to measure our output by counting the number of each sentiment in real time as Tweets are fed
into our pipeline, and updated these counts continuously in a CSV. Once all our data was acquired
for every keyword(s) query, we created visualizations such as pie charts to show the proportion of
each sentiment per query and two histograms showing how the sentiment scores were distributed
for two of our queries. By doing this, we were able to compare the results to our initial hypothesis
and also understand the polarity of these sentiments, whether or not they were “extremely” leaning
one way or just slightly.
However, a Twitter developer announced that on February 9th, 2023, support for free access to
the Twitter API would no longer be available, limiting our options for continuation of the project.
With this constraint in mind, a new task was decided upon, in that with the short timeframe left
for free API access, we would collect as much data that we could in the form of tweets, and store
them in databases based on the keywords we used to filter the livestream. The same streaming
method as described above was used, however without passing in the tweets through the model,
as this was a time consuming task that could be done later without the use of the Twitter API.
Instead, the tweet data was simply written to the file, and the model was run on the database
after all data was collected.
3. Results
We decided on six keywords and phrases closely related to the topic of gun control to use for
filtering within our livestream. These six include, “gun”, “gun control”, “mass shooting”, “school
shooting”, “second amendment”, and “monterey park”. We decided upon these as they are relevant
to the topic, and wanted to experiment with the phrase “monterey park”, as it was a recent event
that we expected to have some conversation on twitter. After data filtering and cleaning, we were
left with roughly 3000 tweets for “gun control”, 5000 tweets for “gun”, 500 for “mass shooting” and
“school shooting”, 1000 for “second amendment”, and 200 for “monterey park”.
With these keywords, we found that for “monterey park”, 42.9 percent of users were seemingly
pro gun control, 28.6 percent were seemingly against gun control, and 28.5 percent felt neutrally;
for “gun”, 8.1 percent of users were seemingly pro gun control, 24.9 percent were seemingly against
gun control, and 67 percent felt neutrally; for “mass shooting”, 90.9 percent of users were seemingly
pro gun control, 4.4 percent were seemingly against gun control, and 4.7 percent felt neutrally; for
“gun control”, 11.8 percent of users were seemingly pro gun control, 31.2 percent were seemingly
against gun control, and 57 percent felt neutrally; for “second amendment”, 84.8 percent of users
were seemingly pro gun control, 3.9 percent were seemingly against gun control, and 11.3 percent
felt neutrally; and finally for “school shooting”, 71.1 percent of users were seemingly pro gun
control, 3.8 percent were seemingly against gun control, and 25.1 percent felt neutrally. With this
data, we were met with some interesting results - overall, a strong “positive” sentiment toward gun
control was observed, meaning many Twitter users talking about these topics are in favor of having
more gun control. However, the percentage of negative sentiments in our research was not that
much lower than the percentage of positives. Another interesting result was the large prevalence
of neutral sentiments. A second statistic output from our model is the “sentiment score”, or in
other words a metric showing one’s particular feeling toward their tweet. The score is measured
between zero to one, with a small sentiment score (<0.5) would mean that the user’s feeling wasn’t
3incredibly strong toward their tweet, and a large sentiment score (>0.5) would mean that the user
had a strong feeling toward their tweet. For most of our keywords, we noticed most of our data
had low sentiment scores, with most having scores around the 0.3 - 0.5 range.
Figure 2. Sentiment Results
Figure 3. Sentiment Scores
44. Discussion
Seeing that the majority sentiment was “positive” toward gun control in most of our results, we
can support and accept our hypothesis in saying that the population on Twitter would mostly be
in support of gun control. For the keywords ""second amendment"", ""school shooting"" and ""mass
shooting"", we can an overwhelming support for this, with pro-gun control sentiments consisting of
over 70 percent of our collected data. However, we can also recognize that the sentiment scores
received from our model do not show strong polarity. While sentiments for “gun” are relatively
neutral, with an interesting 67 percent of tweets showing neutral feelings, sentiments toward more
specific/emotion inducing keywords such as “mass shooting” and “gun control” show overwhelming
support for more gun control within the Twitter community.
However, with these results, there is possible room for improvement. With the constraints from
the Twitter API, a strong and lengthy database was not able to be achieved. In having a larger
database, custom model training for the topic of pro/against gun control could have taken place, in
addition to the simple increase in analysis trustworthiness as a result of having more data ingested
into our results. For further research, we would have also liked to obtain more tweet data from
different keywords, in order to obtain viewpoints from different topics as well.

______________________________________________________________________________
This research paper aims to answer whether the ""wisdom of the crowd"" methodology is a viable
approach to predicting financial markets. The wisdom of the crowd approach is based on the idea that
the aggregation of opinions from many individuals can lead to more accurate and unbiased decisions
and, in the context of financial markets, more accurate predictions of future market movements. We
analyze batches of tweets from Twitter and leverage machine learning models to conduct sentiment
analysis. Through our analysis, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach. Our findings
may have implications for investors, financial analysts, and policymakers, as well as for future
research in this area. The results of our study suggest that the wisdom of the crowd approach can
provide valuable insights into market trends, but also has limitations that need to be carefully
considered. Ultimately, our research aims to contribute to the ongoing discussion surrounding the use
of social media data and machine learning models for financial market predictions.
______________________________________________________________________________
1.   Intr oduction
Predicting financial markets is an important
task that can have a significant impact on
investment decisions and economic policies.
In recent years, the ""wisdom of the crowd""
approach has gained attention as a
methodology that uses collective intelligence
to predict future market movements. This
approach suggests that by aggregating the
opinions of many people, more accurate and
unbiased predictions can be made.
This research paper will delve into whether
the wisdom of the crowd methodology is a
viable approach for predicting financial
markets. To do this, we will analyze batches of
Twitter data and build predictive models to
extract insights and conduct sentiment
analysis. By comparing this approach to
traditional methods, we can provide insight
into the effectiveness of social media data and
machine learning models for financial market
predictions, along with shedding light on the
benefits and limitations of the wisdom of the
crowd.
2.   Literatur e Review
Our study builds on Shawndra Hill’s findings
in “Expert Stock Picker: The Wisdom of
(Expert in) Crowds” (2011). Hill explores the
potential of crowdsourcing as a method for
identifying expert stock pickers. The study
compares the performance of financial
analysts with that of non-expert participants in
a stock-picking competition. The results
indicate that, on average, the non-expert
participants outperformed the financialanalysts in their stock recommendations,
suggesting that the wisdom of the crowd can
be an effective approach to identify expert
stock pickers.
Overall, the research suggests that the wisdom
of the crowd can be a viable approach to
investing, particularly when there is diversity
of opinion and independence of
decision-making. The findings of Hill's paper
suggest that diversity of opinion and
independence of decision-making are
important factors in the success of the wisdom
of the crowd methodology. Therefore, it is
important to carefully consider the context and
characteristics of the crowd when applying
this approach to investing.
3.   Methodology
3.1
Financial Tweets dataset
To collect data for our analysis, we used a
Kaggle dataset of financial tweets collected
between 2015 and 2020 for the top 5 tickers in
S&P 500. There are 3.6 million tweets in this
dataset. We also get their respective
timestamps and tweet ids.
Figure: Line chart of number of tweets from
top 5 tickers 2015-2019
We did some extensive data cleaning to make
sure we only analyzed clean tweets about the
stocks and not ads or spam. Financial Twitter
is buzzing with Telegram channel ads about
trade calls. We removed all URLs from the
tweets and removed all duplicates. We
calculated some in-house heuristics such as
the number of tickers present in a tweet. If a
tweet had more than 3 tickers present, we
removed it from our analysis on the
assumption of it being too ambiguous or either
spam.
3.2
Stock price
dataset
We also used Yahoo Financial historical API
to get historical prices for the respective stock
tickers. We especially needed to observe if the
stock was positive, negative, or neutral the
next day of the prediction. A “neutral” day can
be defined as fairly arbitrary by looking at the
price movements in the table. It’s rare for a
day to be exactly flat, i.e, have a percent
change of 0. Because of this, we made a
threshold for neutral labels. If percentage
change in stock prices were [-0.5,0.5], that day
would be labeled as neutral.
Figure: % change in stock price everyday
3.3  Classification with GPT-3
We used GPT-3 field embeddings API to
embed these tweets, capturing the context and
meaning of the words in the domain of social
media. Using OpenAI’s embedding endpoint,
we were able to transform each tweet into
1,536 high-precision floating point numbers.
These vectors or embeddings will serve as
features in our machine learning model.
Figure: 12,288 dimensions field embedding for
each tweet, obtained from GPT -3
Next, we asked GPT-3 to label a random
subset of 10,000 tweets as Positive, Negative,
or Neutral, providing us with a set of labeled
data for training our model. We used
OpenAI’s latest text-davinci-003 model for the
labeling part.
Figure: Ask GPT -3 to classify tweets into
Negative, Positive or Neutral
These labels were used as the training input
for our classifier.
The field embeddings were a watershed
breakthrough in NLP; they provide an easier
way of finding semantic similarity between
two text strings. For example, we have 3
tweets -
●
“$TSLA calls printing right now! Up
up and Away!” (Tweet A)
●
“All the way green on $MSFT” (Tweet
B)
●
“The bears are tearing $AMZN up”
(Tweet C)
Each of these tweets would be transformed to
a 1,536 dimensional vector, namely Vector
{A,B,C}. If we were to find euclidean
distances within those 3 vectors, we noticed
that the Euclidean distance between Vectors A
and B is much smaller than the distance
between Vectors A and C or Vectors B and C
in a hyper-dimensional space.
3.4  SVM Model
Using these GPT-3 embeddings as our input
value and GPT-3 labels as output labels, we
trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to
classify the remaining tweets. We chose to
train our own classifier because having GPT-3
label every single tweet of the >2 million
tweets would cost over $1000. Hence, we
thought of obtaining a small labeled set at a
fraction of the cost and then train our classifier
on top of it. We ultimately passed all the 2
million embedding vectors into the classifier,
and were able to label every tweet into
“bullish”, “bearish” or “neutral”.
3.4  Model Evaluation
Ultimately, we did our data aggregations
where we aggregated the data on the date and
ticker columns.
Figure: Tickers with number of bullish,
bearish, and neutral labels for each day
The ultimate goal of our analysis was to train
a classifier to accurately predict the stock
market based on the tweets we collected. We
ran the classifier on each tweet on a
day-over-day basis, and based on the
classifications we assigned a rating to the
stock tickers. To evaluate the accuracy of our
predictions, we tracked the performance of the
stocks on the following day after the rating
was assigned. For example, if $TSLA saw a
+7% price movement, it would be labeled as a
positive or “bullish” day. We would then
compare the accuracy by tracking our model’s
prediction for that day.
Figure: Model Architecture
4.   Results
4.1  Visualizing Labels
After classifying all tweets, we used Uniform
Manifold Approximation and Projection
(UMAP) for dimensionality reductions to
reduce our 1,536 dimension vector
embeddings to 2 dimensions for ease of
visualization. We used UMAP over other
dimensionality reduction techniques like
t-SNE and PCA because it has been proven to
be useful at reducing very high dimensional
(> 1000) data. The data points are also color
coded by their labels.
Bullish Tweets are in yellow, Bearish Tweets
are in yellow and Neutral tweets are in Blue.
As observed, the most dense and frequent
label is the Neutral label.
Figure: Scatterplot figure of bullish, bearish,
and neutral tweets
4.2  Dense Neutral Labels
Upon aggregating the results, we found that
the Neutral tweets overpowered the results. Of
the initial 10,000 tweets classified using
GPT-3, 70% were labeled as neutral. This bias
likely permeated when we trained our SVM
classifier on the rest of the 2 million tweets. In
other words, on a certain day for $AAPL,
most predictions were likely neutral because
of the high density of “Neutral” tweets that the
model was trained and tested on.
Figure: Heatmap of the Correlation matrix on
$TSLA predictions and 3 labels
In the correlation matrix above for $TSLA,
the column in the middle represents the
Neutral predictions. Upon this, we thought
of removing the neutral tweets and received
the following confusion matrix for $TSLA:
Figure: Heatmap of $TSLA predictions after
removal of neutral labels
As one can observe, the “T rue Positive” box
on the lower right corner has the highest
frequency , implying that our model
predicted 75% the right label when labeling
“Positive” or “Negative”.
Our results improved significantly from this
change. However , the removal of neutral
labels left us with notably fewer data points.
5.   Futur e Impr ovements
In future iterations of this methodology, there
is an opportunity to utilize real-time streaming
clients such as Astra DB and Twitter API to
produce more relevant and useful predictions.
Since February 9th, 2023, Twitter has ended
free access to its API. As a result, with current
limitations in resources and funding, projects
involving the collection of data from Twitter
(via wrappers such as Tweepy or Twython)
would not be possible at this time.
Figure
:
Block diagram of the proposed
methodology utilizing streaming clients
However, using streaming clients in the future,
we would be able to stream and classify tweets
in real-time. Approximately hundreds of
tweets relating to financial markets are posted
every second. We would be able to filter
specific tickers with Tweepy to view tweets of
tickers such as $TSLA, $GOOGL, $APPL,
$MSFT, and $AMZN. After a set length of
time of streaming and classifying tweets, we
could perform a similar buy rating for each
ticker. Assuming that roughly 1,000 relevant
tweets about $TSLA are posted within a
minute, we could classify each tweet and give
a buy rating for $TSLA within a minute
timeframe. This would provide more relevant
and useful information for the user since
everything is up-to-date and can influence
trading strategies such as day or swing trading.
6.   Conclusion
Our research has shown that advanced natural
language processing techniques can provide
valuable insights into the wisdom of the crowd
phenomenon. By utilizing an extremely large
dataset and GPT-3 field embeddings, we were
able to classify tweets into Bullish, Bearish,
and Neutral sentiments with the help of GPT-3
and SVMs. Furthermore, by utilizing overall
sentiments to make a decision on buying,
selling, or holding a particular stock ticker, we
were able to show the potential of the wisdom
of the crowd.
Nonetheless, further research is needed to
improve the accuracy and usability of our
analysis, particularly with the use of real-time
streaming clients. Despite these limitations,
our study highlights the potential of a popular
phenomenon and advanced natural language
processing techniques for sentiment analysis,
and the potential applications of such analysis
in fields such as economics and financial
markets.

Abstract
Twitter is a highly influential social media platform that enables users to share and
respond to short, real-time messages with a global audience. Despite its popularity , Twitter is not
immune to the proliferation of spam content within conversations, particularly on sensitive and
controversial social topics like abortion. These topics hold valuable insights as proxies to gauge
the sentiments of the general public.
However , it has been dif ficult for researchers to model public opinion on Twitter in
real-time while also accounting for the presence of politically char ged or noise-infused tweets.
Therefore, our objective is to build a pipeline that allows for streaming live tweet data and
analyzing the change in sentiment by using spam-filtering models, Naive Bayes and a transfer
learning model based on BER T. We will examine and compare the overall sentiment distribution
of positive, neutral, and negative sentiment of all tweets and filtered tweets, as well as sentiment
compound scores calculated by the NL TK Vader model. This analysis will allow us to better
understand the impact of spam presence on public sentiment on social media.
1. Introduction
With the growth of technology since
the 2000s, the growth of social media
platforms has grown alongside. Social media
platforms are a way for individuals to
interact and communicate with each other .
One type of social media platform that has
grown exponentially are microblogging
platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.
These platforms are extremely valuable to
everyone because it provides an outlet to
gain more information for both public and
private uses. It is a place that can hold
opinions and can also be used by businesses
or media outlets to get a general idea of
people’ s opinions towards a specific topic.
While these platforms have grown
exponentially , the issue with spam has also
grown exponentially . The main goal of
spammers is to mislead real users through
means such as malicious links or
misinformation. That is in direct violation of
the philosophy that Twitter is built on
serving the public conversation [1].
Our objective is to understand how
public sentiment on abortion will change
after accounting for spam content. We
believe that spam will skew the public
sentiment on abortion more negatively
because spam generally is used to mislead
and misinform individuals. We choose to
focus on abortions specifically because it is
a controversial topic that contains a lar ge
amount of conversation. It is also a topic
that contains lots of spam with the recent
growth in public attention that it has
received with the politicization of it.To accomplish this task, we integrate
spam detection into the sentiment analysis
process with real-time tweets on abortion to
gain insights on the ef fect of spam in
real-time rather than having outdated results
skewed by constantly changing opinions. By
comparing the sentiments derived from both
spam-filtered tweets and raw tweets content,
we are able to gain a deeper understanding
of the influence of spam on public opinion
by exposing its prevalence and potentially
misleading messages.
We will be using two dif ferent
models for spam detection: a simpler Naive
Bayes classifier and a more advanced
transfer learning model based on Google’ s
BER T. They are complemented by NL TK
VADER for sentiment analysis. We will get
more into this in the later sections.
2. Literature Review
Prior sentiment analysis research on
Twitter (tweets text data, especially) has
successfully built and compared machine
learning models for analyzing tweets
sentiment, in which they found ensemble
models scored over 95% in accuracy ,
precision, and F1-score, outperforming
supervised learning and convolutional neural
networks models predicting sentiment using
Twitter data[2]. While the study provided us
with insights on model selection, its
accessibility and generalizability can be
further improved if combined with
streaming data service, like Apache Pulsar .
Furthermore, related work on
analyzing Twitter data has been through
batches that analyzed tweets of certain
timeframes [2, 3]. However , this lacks
generalizability since the results of the
sentiments are only applicable up to a
certain time period, instead of tracking the
continuous change in sentiment as the
sentiments evolve.
With the introduction of the
transformer architecture, it has dominated
the field of Natural Language Processing
using novel attention mechanisms with high
levels of parallelism, essentially
outperforming LSTMs and classical RNNs
in this domain [6]. Furthermore, there have
been studies that adopt existing lar ge
language models, like Google’ s BER T, for
the task of spam classification. Specifically ,
a universal spam detection (USDM) transfer
learning architecture for BER T has been
proposed that achieved an average of 97%
accuracy and F1 score of 0.96 across the
Enron, Spamassain, Lingspam, and Spam
text message classification datasets [7].
3. Description of data
For the purpose of this project, we
acquired data from two distinct sources to
develop machine learning models and
address our research question.
For the training of our two models,
we use a pre-labeled dataset from the
University of Tennessee Machine Learning
organization hosted on Kaggle. The dataset
consists of data on 1 1,968 tweets with
additional information about following and
followers, activity , location of the user if
they provided it, if the tweet was a retweet,
and if the tweet was quality or spam.
To determine if a certain tweet was
quality or spam, the dataset defines a spam
tweet as those that are ‘politically
motivated’, ‘automatically generatedcontent’, ‘meaningless content’, and ‘click
bait’. In general, these tweets are ones that
do not contribute to the public conversation.
When looking at the dataset we want
to be sure that it is a balanced dataset to
make sure that each class of label is
represented equally to prevent the model
from being biased towards one class. As we
can see in Fig. 1, the dataset represents close
to the same number of quality and spam
tweets.
Figure 1: Quality vs Spam labels
The dataset also contains a lot of
valuable information to decide what features
are important to classify a tweet as spam or
not. For example, we can look at the ef fect
that an image has on a tweet being classified
as spam or not by looking at the number of
tweets that contain a picture versus being
quality or spam. We are able to see if a tweet
has an image if the tweet contains
“pic.twitter”. As we can see in Fig. 2, having
a picture in the tweet is usually a more
quality post rather than spam.
Figure 2: Picture vs Type of Tweet
To address the research question, we
retrieved tweet information through Twitter
API using streaming services with
topic-related filtering (abortion). The
collected information resembles the training
dataset, having attributes such as number of
followers, following, etc. of the account.
Rules under Twitter API for filtering
the streaming Twitter data include an
English language filter , which only
considers English tweets (
lang:en
). This
filter defines our tar get population to be
English-speaking Twitter users and express
their thoughts about abortion online. We also
applied a keyword filter , which considers
tweets containing ‘
abortion
’ in its text
content.
The dataset (figure 3) contains the
information of 27,397 abortion-related
tweets collected during a 10-day time frame
in February .

4. Methods
4.1 Proposed Pipeline
Our framework for the pipeline
(figure 4) has four main components: data
retrieval, spam detection, sentiment analysis,
and visualization.
This pipeline is facilitated through
the use of Astra Streaming, which is built
upon Apache Pulsar . Pulsar utilizes the
publish-subscribe pattern: producers publish
messages to a topic, and consumers
subscribe to those topics and process the
incoming messages. Additionally , we also
employ the use of Pulsar Functions, which
are lightweight processes configured by
user-supplied logic that consumes messages
from one topic and publishes to another
according to said logic.
Firstly , we have a producer that
requests real time tweets from the Twitter
API v2 using the filtered stream end point,
retrieves relevant attributes, and publishes
the formatted data to a Pulsar topic (Raw
Tweet Topic).
Secondly , we have consumers
subscribe to the Raw Tweet Topic. Two
consumers will use ML  models to filter out
spam tweets then perform sentiment
analysis. One would remain as a control
group and perform the sentiment analysis
directly . The result will be delivered to a
data source (Google Spreadsheet, for
Figure 4: Streaming Pipeline
example) and further analyzed and
visualized on Grafana.
4.2 Data Retrieval
Twitter API of fers two dif ferent
types of streams: sampled stream and
filtered stream. Sampled streams are not
linked to any topic and it takes a 1% sample
of all tweets in real-time. Filtered streams
are linked to a topic by user -generated rules.
The rules are used to match tweets that
follow certain attributes. In our case, we
used the filtered streams endpoint to match
tweets in English and contain the keyword
‘abortion.’  Limiting the language to only
English generates daily data granularity
~50k tweets. However , the selection of
language introduces a potential risk to the
representativeness of spam labeling  and
sentiment distribution.
To obtain specified information, such
as number of account followers, following,
and whether a tweet is retweeted, we
reviewed all relevant attributes and included
public_metrics
of tweets.
With the filtered stream end point,
we receive a response as a stringified JSON
format. Within the Pulsar producer , we
processed the nested data and sent out
formatted JSON data with predefined
Schema to Consumer for downstream
classification and sentiment analysis.
4.3 Data Pre-Processing
Original tweet texts contain links,
emojis, retweet marks, etc. that need to be
cleaned for sentiment analysis. Below are a
few steps that we take to preprocess tweet
texts. More examples can be found under
section 4.2.1.
●
Remove links, hashtags, mentions
●
Lowercase letter
●
Remove extra spaces, punctuations
4.3.1 Data Pre-Processing Naive Bayes
When a tweet is extracted from
Twitter , it comes in many dif ferent forms
which would not work well as an input for
our data. If we do not pre-process the data,
the concept of “Garbage in, garbage out”
would apply . Since we are using a Naive
Bayes classifier , we want to remove the
features of a tweet that are unique and
unlikely to be seen in other tweets because it
follows Bayes theorem which looks at
probabilities of an event based on the
occurrence of another event. In our case, it
will be the probability that it is spam or not
based on the probability of certain words
appearing. As we can see in Fig. 5, the
tweets contain a lot of dif ferent elements
that are related to the use of social media,
but are not related to the actual message that
they are attempting to convey . Therefore, we
only want to keep the base of the tweet and
remove all other elements such as hashtags,
links or symbols. We also want to make the
structure of the tweet more uniform because
tweets tend to be informal and have many
errors such as multiple spaces between
words. As we can see in Fig. 6, there is more
uniformity between the tweets and still holds
the message from the person who tweeted.

Figure 6: After Processed Tweets
4.3.2 Data Pre-Processing BERT Transfer
Learning
Before the raw tweet is fed into the
transfer learning model, the raw text must be
transformed to three tensors: numeric token
IDs, input masks, type IDs. Additionally ,
padding, special tokens, and masks must
also be added and created for feature
homogeneity to BER T’s original training
data. This is done through using the
corresponding preprocessor to the BER T
encoder , and is simplified with the user of
Tensorflow Hub’ s implementation of
multiple downloadable preprocessors. It’ s
worthwhile to note that since BER T was
trained on documents that have a max token
length of 128, all tweets are truncated to 128
tokens (words) during the preprocessing
stage. While Twitter currently only supports
280 characters (roughly 56 tokens) it does
have potential future plans to increase the
character limit to 4000 characters (around
800 tokens). This requires a dif ferent
padding and masking preprocessing
mechanism for BER T for future replication
projects.
4.4 Classification
To achieve our goal, we employed
two dif ferent spam classification models,
then each model will feed their results to
NLTK VADER for sentiment analysis. We
chose to implement two dif ferent spam
classification models to compare the
performance of the BER T transfer learning
model by comparing it to the simpler Naive
Bayes model. We also chose to use the
pre-trained VADER model, which was
optimized for classifying sentiments in
social media microblogs.
4.4.1 Spam Classification Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes classifier is a
probabilistic classifier based on Bayes
theorem. It finds the probability that a tweet
is spam given that it contains certain words.
It finds the probability that each word is
spam and multiplies it together to determine
if a tweet is spam or not.
We choose to use a Naive Bayes
classifier because it is a simple and ef fective
model to work as a baseline solution to
compare to a more advanced model. It is an
effective solution because certain words are
more likely to be used in a spam tweet over
a quality one. We also chose to use amultinomial Naive Bayes model over a
Bernoulli Naive Bayes model because it
works of f of occurrence counts rather than
the presence or absence of a word.
Before training the model we split
the data into a 75-25 split using
“train_test_split” from the scikit-learn
module to have data to test if the model is
performing correctly . To train the model, we
have to take the preprocessed data and
transform it into a form that works with the
multinomial Naive Bayes model. In our
case, we use “CountV ectorizer” from the
scikit-learn module to transform the text to a
matrix of token counts for unigrams. We use
unigrams instead of bigrams or more
because we are interested in the probability
of each individual word being spam or not.
To optimize the multinomial Naive Bayes
model, we need to choose the best alpha
value for the model, which we get by
performing grid search. The best alpha value
for the model was .5 and after testing the
accuracy of the model, we received an
accuracy of 79.48%. In Fig. 7, we can see
the confusion matrix on how the model
performs on its predictions by class. The
testing dataset consisted of 2,992 tweets.

4.4.2 Spam Classification BERT
The model architecture used is inspired by
state of the art works of transfer learning on
BER T for NLP  tasks. [6, 7].,
Figure 8: BERT Spam Classification Architecture
After the text has been preprocessed, it’ s fed
into the BER T encoder
(bert_en_uncased_L-12_H-768_A-12/4),
which contains 12 layers, 768 hidden units,
and 12 attention heads. In figure 8, the
BER T output of size 768 is then reduced to
dimension of 175, where batch dropout,
batch normalization, with ReLU activation.
Before feeding into the next layer , dropout is
performed again. The next layer is the same
with dimension of 100, and results in the
next layer/prediction of spam or not spam of
a tweet. Dropout is introduced to prevent
over-dependence of certain neurons and to
improve robustness. Batch normalization is
used to normalize the activations within the
layer to mitigate internal covariant shifts to
improve the model’ s stability . ReLU is
employed to learn non-linear patterns within
the data. Finally , a sigmoidal activation layer
is used to cast the output to a probability
between spam(1) or no spam(0). The
architecture results in 85.3% accuracy , a
significant improvement over the naive
bayes model. As seen in figure 9, the main
improvement is actually the reduction of
false negatives — tweets that were predicted
as non-spam that were actually spam. This
hints that the attention mechanism provides
meaningful contributions by semantically
understanding individual tokens in relation
to their surrounding text.

4.4.3 Sentiment Classification NLTK
We have three consumers that
subscribe to the Raw Tweet Topic, where
each receives the tweet data. Each consumer
will then first perform spam classification,
then classify the sentiment of the stream of
tweets in one of three categories: positive,
neutral, and negative.
One consumer directly classifies the
sentiment of the tweest since it has no
designated spam filtering mechanism. This
provides the baseline for monitoring how
spam af fects the sentiment of the topic.
A second consumer utilizes the naive
bayes model to filter spam tweets, then
classifies the sentiments of the tweet.
A third consumer utilizes the BER T
transfer learning model to filter out spam
tweets and classifies the sentiment of the
tweet.
We choose to use the pre-trained
VADER for sentiment analysis since it was
designed and trained with microblog-like
data, just like Twitter [5]. VADER is a
lexical based model that maps words to
sentiment by building a dictionary of
sentiments, also known as a lexicon.
Vader uses a lar ge lexicon that
includes emoticons and slangs which are fit
for platforms like Twitter . For example, both
“sux” and “sucks” have the same sentiment
polarity score assigned by VADER. More
specifically , it assigns a numerical sentiment
rating of each term from -4 to 4 to account
for polarities of sentiment.
VADER then evaluates the sentiment
of a sentence or corpus through the
normalizing the sum of the sentiment score
for each lexical feature (words and
emoticons), outputting a number between -1
and 1.
The sentiment scores of VADER also
retain contextual information about the
lexicons within the sentence through 5 novel
heuristics. Namely , it uses punctuation
marks, capitalizations, degree modifiers,
usage of the word “but”, and tri-grams to
gain contextual awareness [4].
In the Pulsar consumer , we use the
compound polarity score from VADER’ s, to
assign a sentiment score to each incoming
tweet. Since the compound score is the
numerical representation of the polarity of asentence between -1 and 1, we classify the
corresponding sentiment through the
following:
●
Positive: compound score >= 0.05
●
Neutral: -0.05 < compound score <
0.05
●
Negative: compound score <= -0.05
We choose to have text with a polarity score
between -0.05 and 0.05 be rated as neutral to
account for opposite terms not being able to
cancel each other out fully due to the
valence score not being gauged exactly the
same from word to word.
5. Results
The accuracy of the Naive Bayes
model trained on the Kaggle training dataset
is 79.5%, and the accuracy of the transfer
learning model based on BER T is 85.3% on
the test dataset.
Using those two models, we
predicted whether collected
abortion
tweets
were spam or not.
Out of 27,397
abortion
tweets, the
spam classification results can be found
below in figure 10. More than 69% of tweets
were classified as ‘spam’  by both models,
and 50% were manually classified as spam
tweets.

We then conducted NL TK sentiment
analysis on all 27,397 tweets and filtered
tweets. The sentiment distribution can be
found in figure 1 1.

Tweets
The results revealed that negative
sentiment was the most prevalent,
constituting over 40% of all sentiments,
followed by positive sentiment, while
neutral sentiment was the least common.
It also suggests a similarity on the sentiment
distribution, regardless of whether spam is
present or not. The maximum dif ference is
6%.
Besides categorical sentiment, we
scrutinized the exact sentiment compound
score distribution as well. Figure 12 and 13
compare the sentiment compound score
(SCS) between all tweets (unfiltered) and
filtered tweets by Naive Bayes and BER T.
Figure 12: Comparison of SCS between all tweets
and Naive Bayes filtered tweets
Figure 13: Comparison of SCS between all tweets
and BERT filtered tweets
The distributions of SCS of both
spam-filtered models show a similarity to
the distribution of all tweets (unfiltered),
suggesting the sentiment similarity of
filtered tweets to that of all tweets.
Figure 14 shows the descriptive
statistics of SCS under dif ferent scenarios.

Figure 14. Mean of SCS under different conditions
Figure 13 depicts the distribution of
Sentiment Compound Scores (SCS) for all
tweets, Naive Bayes (NB) filtered tweets,
and BER T filtered tweets. However , it didn’ t
obviously show that the distribution shift
results in lower SCS values for filtered
tweets compared to all tweets. The mean
SCS for NB filtered tweets, BER T filtered
tweets, and all tweets (non-filtered) are
approximately -0.065, -0.042, and -0.071,
respectively .
The observed pattern, with
spam-filtered tweets exhibiting lower SCS
than unfiltered tweets, aligns with the SCS
of manually filtered tweets, which average
around -0.033. Furthermore, the discrepancy
in SCS between BER T filtered tweets and
all tweets (0.029) is notably lar ger than that
between NB filtered tweets and all tweets
(0.006). This mar ginal dif ference for the NB
spam classifier implies that a user
employing an NB-based spam filter on
Twitter would likely perceive no noticeable
change in sentiment within the discussions
compared to not using any filter .
By examining the mean SCS for
abortion-related tweets, BER T model
demonstrates generalizability beyond the
training dataset. The observed mean SCS of
BER T filtered tweets (-0.042) closely aligns
with the manually filtered (ground truth)
mean (-0.033), with a dif ference of 0.009.
Comparatively , the dif ference between NB
and manually filtered tweets is 0.03,
suggesting that BER T's spam classification
is a more desirable approach than utilizing
the NB spam classifier .
6. Discussions
We trained models on a collected
dataset of tweets that covers a variety of
topics and used those to predict completely
new data.
In order to find the
ground truth
for
abortion-related topics, we manually labeled
300 tweets. While our manual labeling
process is useful in providing ground truth,
it may be subject to bias due to the
subjective nature of evaluating spam
content. Figure 15 refers to a reply tweet to
an abortion-related tweet, which is manually
labeled as a spam tweet that falls into the
‘politically motivated’  category of spam.
Figure 15: Manually labeled spam tweet
Our group's evaluation standards
may vary among members and deviate from
those in the training dataset, potentially
leading to inconsistencies in labeling. We
also recognize that our manual labeling
process incorporated supplementary
information, such as context and user profile
details, which is unavailable to text-only
models. This additional data may contribute
to subjectivity , potentially af fecting the
objectivity and generalizability of our
findings.
Despite these limitations, our study
demonstrates the potential of utilizing a
spam-labeled, general dataset encompassing
a wide array of topics to predict spam
content within a specific domain.
Furthermore, the alignment of our manually
labeled data with the overall trends in the
dataset lends credibility to our results.
Our next step will focus on
incorporating more topics and features to the
existing models.
7. Conclusion
Our analysis of streamed tweets on
abortion-related topics reveals that a
significant proportion of tweets contain
spam content, as determined by both Naive
Bayes and transfer learning models. Despite
the prevalence of spam, we found that the
sentiment distributions of all tweets and
manually/model filtered quality tweets were
quite similar , with the majority expressing
negative sentiment with a maximum
sentiment dif ference of 6%. Furthermore,
examination of the sentiment compound
score suggested that the presence of spam
did not have a significant impact on the
overall sentiment towards abortion-related
topics. However , upon closer inspection, we
observed a slightly more negative sentiment
associated with tweets containing spam, as
indicated by the mean sentiment compound
score. This finding highlights the potential
for spam to subtly influence public
sentiment and underscores the importance of
identifying and filtering out such content in
future analyses.

ConclusionDespite credit score being a signiﬁcant metric for lenders during the loan application approval process, this single metric fails to consider how underrepresented demographics may be deemed as unworthy of credit when in fact they should be worthy. This is a lose-lose for both lenders and applicants. On one hand, lenders lose potential customers (""the credit invisible"") who are excluded due to this traditional process. At the same time, these applicants are not allowed to receive credit, which makes things like buying a house seemingly impossible. We aim to explore the limitations of traditional credit score models and propose an alternative method for determining creditworthiness that is more inclusive and equitable. We approach this problem by utilizing supplemental features like a user's categorized transaction history to the traditional credit scoring model. With a user's bank statements, we could extract information like the transaction date, amount, and memo to ﬂag each transaction into a category (with ~89% accuracy). The next step would be to utilize these categories in creating new features to optimize common credit scoring models to make them stronger and more fair. This approach solves both of the problems we described above as it will aid applicants with low/no credits as well as proﬁt-hungry institutions looking to acquire more customers in ﬁnancial industry.AppendixBank statement Example- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_statement

Abstract
Categorizing credit transactions is critical in the finance industry for
understanding spending behavior, detecting fraud, and preventing losses.
Natural language processing (NLP) can automate the categorization pro-
cess by analyzing transaction memos. However, text cleaning poses chal-
lenges, such as handling misspellings, abbreviations, and non-standard
language. We explore NLP techniques for categorizing credit transactions
and evaluate several machine learning algorithms. Our study identifies the
best-performing algorithm for transaction categorization, and we discuss
its potential applications in fraud detection and customer segmentation.
We also highlight limitations and future research directions. Our research
demonstrates the effectiveness of NLP methods for automating the cate-
gorization of credit transactions, improving efficiency and accuracy.
11 Introduction
The categorization of credit transactions is an essential task in the finance in-
dustry. It involves grouping transactions into meaningful categories based on
their purpose, which enables financial institutions to better understand their
customers’ spending behavior, detect suspicious activities, and prevent fraud.
However, manual categorization can be a tedious and time-consuming process,
especially when dealing with large volumes of transactions. To overcome this
challenge, natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be used to auto-
matically categorize credit transactions based on their memos.
Additionally, Credit scoring is a system creditors use to predict whether some-
one is worthy of receiving a loan. Given the sheer amount of credit seekers, it
is impossible to evaluate each case on a personalized basis. Instead, there are
automated methods to predict someone’s creditworthiness. Linear regression
was used for these purposes starting in the 1940s. Today, predictive classifica-
tion methods are generally used by making use of more advanced personalized
models that can learn from vast amounts of data.
In recent years, NLP has shown significant potential for automating transac-
tion categorization. With the increasing volume of credit transactions, the use of
NLP techniques can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of the cat-
egorization process. However, categorizing transactions based on their memos
presents several challenges. For instance, transaction memos often contain non-
standard language, abbreviations, and misspellings, making text cleaning a cru-
cial step in the process. Furthermore, a transaction’s memo might be insufficient
to categorize it accurately, requiring additional data sources to achieve better
results.
As for credit scoring, statistical methods such as regression have been widely
used in credit scoring techniques and applications. More advanced techniques,
such as neural networks, have also proved useful in building scoring models.
Thus far, the literature has shown that both techniques, amongst other sta-
tistical methods, lead to very similar accuracies in predicting creditworthiness.
Additionally, numerous evaluation criteria, such as Gini coefficients and ROC
curves are used to evaluate the limitations and effectiveness of scoring models.
For these cases, it is useful to have historical data that consists of credit seekers,
whether or not they’re delinquent, their annual income, and their demographics,
such as age, gender, city/state of residence, etc. In our case, the data consisted
of a subset of about 50,000 datapoints, and 832 features, sourced from our in-
dustry partner, Petal. We have the aforementioned data of each time someone
applied for a Petal card. In most cases, and in our case, the vast majority of
the datapoints will represent credit seekers who are not delinquent. Thus, to
avoid naive predictions due to imbalanced data (i.e., a model that just predicts
everyone as creditworthy), cost-sensitive methods ought to be used, and/or data
2manipulation techniques that accentuate the correlations between features and
the rare class (not creditworthy) so that the model may represent the ground
truth better.
2 Methods
When analyzing a credit transaction dataset, it is essential to preprocess the
data before applying machine learning algorithms. In this section, we describe
the methods we used to clean and preprocess the transaction memos and extract
relevant features for categorization.
Firstly, we converted the memo column of the dataset to lowercase and used
regular expressions to remove any punctuation marks, such as commas, back-
slashes, and periods, that may hinder the accuracy of the categorization model.
We also removed any digits that were present in the memo column as they
would not be relevant to the categorization process. Although some transaction
memos may contain relevant numerical information, removing them resulted in
better performance of the model overall.
Moreover, we enriched the dataset by adding features from the transaction date
column, such as the day of the week and month, which could provide valuable
information about the spending behavior of credit users. These features were
extracted and added to the dataset to supplement the information present in
the memo column.
We then used a term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) object to
vectorize the transaction memos, with the stop words argument set to English
and the n-gram range set to (1,3). The tf-idf object is commonly used in NLP
to quantify the relevance of a term in a document based on its frequency and
importance across all documents in the corpus. This allowed us to identify and
extract the most relevant features for categorizing credit transactions.
To train and validate our model, we split the dataset into training and vali-
dation sets. We fit and transformed the training set using the tf-idf object and
then used logistic regression to categorize the transaction memos. We chose
logistic regression as it is a simple yet effective classification algorithm that can
be easily implemented and interpreted. We evaluated the performance of our
model using the accuracy metric provided by the scikit-learn library.
In summary, we used various techniques to preprocess and extract relevant
features from the transaction dataset, including text cleaning, feature engineer-
ing, and vectorization. We then applied logistic regression to categorize the
transactions and evaluated the performance of our model using accuracy met-
rics. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in accurately
categorizing credit transactions and highlight their potential for automating the
3categorization process in the finance industry.
3 Results
First, we investigated the results of our tf-idf objects. When looking at the
most frequent multi-word phrases (capped at 3), we saw a variety of service
platforms, such as Uber and Netflix as well as physical stores, such as Walmart
and Starbucks. Large city names such as Los Angeles and Las Vegas also ap-
peared frequently.
Our Sci-kit learn accuracy score gave our model an accuracy of 0.86, which
indicates that it can accurately categorize a vast majority of the credit trans-
actions. This score was our subset accuracy in a multi-label classification, as it
returns the fraction of correctly classified samples out of our overall data set.
With our baseline accuracy of 0.86, we set out to improve our accuracy score by
tuning the model. While we were able to achieve a 0.92, this score introduced
the risk of our model over-fitting to the training data-set. Thus, we decided to
finalize the initial results of 0.86, which satisfied industry standards in terms of
classification accuracy.
4 Discussion
The baseline model without any transformations of any of the columns had a
relatively low accuracy, which means that even when preprocessing the data,
the Softmax Regression model wasn’t a good fit for classification in this case.
We also saw that the performance of the XGBoost model and Random Forest
models were relatively similar, even after optimizing their hyper-parameters.
Possible approaches to increasing the accuracy of the predictions made by the
models would be perhaps upsampling the training set so that the classification
labels would be more balanced. Furthermore, the creation of self made features
based on already existing features could also possibly increase the accuracy of
label predictions.
Regarding prior work in the field, credit scoring models have been in use for
many decades. Linear regression, in particular, was popular in the 1940s. Since
then, however, better performing statistical techniques have come to use, such
as the ones we have been using. Today, many creditors still use variations of
logistic regression, XGBoost, random forest, KNN, and others. The real differ-
entiators between the good models and the exceptional models are moreso the
quality/quantity of the data they’re trained on (through acquisition and prepro-
cessing) than the type of model itself. There doesn’t appear to be a consensus
4in the field as to what the single best model architecture looks like, as that may
very depending on the data.
When benchmarking our approach against prior work in the field, we found
that our methodology follows a similar path to industry-standard practices.
However, the models deployed in industry tend to have higher performance,
typically exceeding an accuracy of 90%. Upon closer examination, we identified
several key factors that contribute to the performance gap between our model
and industry-standard models.
One significant factor is data pre-processing, which plays a critical role in
the performance of any NLP model. Industry models tend to have access to
larger and more diverse datasets, enabling them to perform more extensive pre-
processing on the data. In contrast, our dataset may not be as comprehensive,
resulting in reduced performance.
Another factor is feature engineering and selection, where industry models tend
to employ more sophisticated techniques to extract and select relevant features.
For instance, industry models may use more advanced NLP techniques, such
as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, or sentiment analysis, to
enrich the features and improve the model’s performance. Our model used a
simpler approach to feature engineering, which may have led to reduced perfor-
mance.
Moreover, industry models typically have more access to data and resources,
including more powerful computing infrastructure capable of processing large
volumes of data quickly. This enables them to train more complex models with
greater precision and accuracy. In contrast, our model was trained on a smaller
dataset and used less computing power, potentially contributing to the lower
performance.
Despite the performance gap, our model provides a solid foundation for au-
tomating credit transaction categorization and demonstrating the potential of
NLP in the finance industry. By identifying areas for improvement and incor-
porating more advanced techniques, such as those used in industry-standard
models, we can work towards closing the performance gap and creating models
that are more accurate and effective.
As we continue to refine our model, we recognize the importance of gaining
a deeper understanding of credit scoring systems and financial transaction cat-
egorization. By improving our knowledge in these areas, we can better process
the data and select/engineer more effective features for the model.
To achieve this, we plan to conduct further research and analysis on credit scor-
ing systems, including exploring how different credit factors affect credit scores,
such as payment history, credit utilization, and length of credit history. Addi-
5tionally, we will investigate the factors that contribute to financial transaction
categorization and develop more sophisticated techniques for feature extraction
and selection.
Furthermore, we acknowledge that larger and more diverse datasets are cru-
cial for improving the performance of our model. Therefore, we plan to acquire
additional data sources and leverage more advanced computing resources to
train larger and more complex models.
We believe that these efforts will ultimately lead to significant improvements in
our model’s performance, enabling us to make more accurate predictions about
credit users and detect suspicious financial activity more effectively. Moreover,
these advancements in NLP-based credit scoring and financial transaction cat-
egorization could have broader implications for the finance industry, improving
the accuracy and efficiency of financial decision-making and enhancing overall
financial stability.

Sahil Wadhwa, Nancy Jiang

Abstract
In the twentieth century , one of sociology’ s findings is that race and gender
matter in the job market. Jobs were segregated by race and gender with whites earning
more than other people of color and men earning more than women. Race inequality in
the job market has been a long-standing interest of scholars. Notably , some research
indicates that racial gaps are more significant for women than for men. W omen face the
unique challenges of lower wages and lower rewards in the global workforce. However ,
as women’ s relative share in occupations grows nowadays, the gender inequality gap
narrows in most job markets (Stier et al., 2014). Besides, a finding shows that
race-based discrimination is weaker in high-paid jobs. Back in 2012, the Harvard
Business Review acclaimed data science as “the sexiest job of the 21st century”. Some
may pose the question of whether the statement still holds today . According to the U.S.
BUREAU of Labor Statistics, employment in data science is projected to grow 36% from
2021 to 2031, much faster than the average for all occupations, which means
employers will create more than 13,500 new data science related job opportunities each
year on average, over the decade (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2022). Thus, we are
curious about gender-based and race-based inequality in data science.I. Introduction
The inequality that we are going to study consists of racial and gender
discrimination in data science employment. There has been previous work related to
these problems (gender and racial bias in general employment) but not in a specific field
job market. The null hypothesis that we will be testing is that there is no race and
gender inequality in the dataset that we are going to collect. Our study will be trying to
decipher whether we want to accept or reject the null hypothesis by using an ANOV A
test.
Our first step will be collecting as much as possible data and then cleaning it. W e
will then start to analyze the data through a descriptive analysis where we will
mathematically describe and summarize the data that we found. Next, we will undergo
diagnostic analysis where we will study the dif ferent rates of employment in the data
science field for dif ferent genders and races. Finally , we will use visual analysis to
communicate our findings.
II. Methods
We started out our project by compiling all the data that we needed for our tests.
We gathered this data by using a job recommendation website where we gathered data
for 12 male subjects and 12 female subjects. For each gender , we gathered data within
4 different races (white, black, hispanic, asian). Some of the attributes that we gathered
included the location of the recommended job, whether the job was remote, whether the
job was full-time, how many employees were at this specific job, what type of field this
job was in and what position was being of fered. Some secondary attributes that wecollected included what the main responsibilities of the job were for the employee and
what the positional requirements were for the job.
The three attributes that we decided to focus on were what position was being
offered (level of the job), how many employees were at the of fered job and the type of
job was being of fered. The first two attributes would help us decipher what level of job
was being of fered to each race and each gender . Meanwhile, the type of job attribute
would help us analyze the dif ferent jobs that are being of fered to the dif ferent types of
races and genders we are looking at.
Our main method that we used was an ANOV A test. W e summed up the counts
for each of the three attributes which were level, employees and type. W e used a bar
plot to represent the employee counts for each range of employees and pie plots to
represent the level and type attributes.
III. Results
As we began our ANOV A test, the first attribute that we looked at was the job
level dif ference that was of fered by dif ferent companies between the dif ferent races. As
you can see in Figure 1 below , we found that the Hispanic people actually received the
highest level of jobs at the mid-senior level followed by the Asian people, Black people
and White people.Figure 1: The distribution of job level difference for each race
The next attribute we looked at was the number of employees of these
companies which would also help us judge the level of jobs each race received from the
potential employer . As you can see in Figure 2 below , we found that the jobs with the
most employees were of fered mostly to Black and Hispanic people. The White and
Asian people alternated who was higher depending on our selected ranges.
Figure 2: The distribution of numbers of the company employees for each race
The third attribute that we studied was the type of jobs that were of fered to each
gender and race. This attribute gave us varied results and there wasn’t one consecutive
pattern throughout each race or even each gender . For some races, the higher level job
offers were received more by the women than the men. However , some of the other
races had the men receive the higher level jobs so there was no obvious pattern.
The statistical results of our two-way ANOV A test which used an average job
level of ranked recommendation which was dependent on the applicant’ s gender and
race (ethnicity) in an online job market website gave us dif ferent results for each
measure. For the p-value for the gender test, we received a value of 0.799. Meanwhile,
for the p-value for the race test, we received a value of 0.092. Finally , for the p-value of
the race and gender test, we received a value of 0.624.

as dependent on the applicant’s gender and race (ethnicity) in an online job market website. n = 16
IV. Conclusion and Discussion
In our project, we tried to discover if gender and racial bias was present in data
science employment. According to our results, our test failed to reject the null
hypotheses. W e calculated this by using a two-way ANOV A test using average job level
as our dependent variable meanwhile race and gender served as our independent
variables. The result shows that none of our three tests (gender , race, race + gender)
show any type of inequality . The reason why we are rejecting our hypotheses is
because none of our p-values was under the standard 0.05 level. However , if we used
the 0.1 level of significance, there might have been some dif ferential treatment when it
came to race. That level of significance is a very weak indicator so we decided to keep
our original results.
One of the biggest limitations that we saw in our study was our limited ability to
analyze small dif ferences. So many of our dif ferences were miniscule so it's tough to
discern if this is a strong ef fect or not. The most obvious limitation is that we need more
data for a multitude of reasons. The biggest reason for more data is that a sample size
of 24 people is not enough. Another reason is that we need to try to collect more data
because it would help in catching any confounding variables. The trouble we had
reproducing the same dataset is that there are some variables that are inconsistent
between data points and the data is tough to collect in general. Our main goal in future
studies is that we hope we are able to enlighten people on the possible inequality that
seems to be prevalent in one of the up and coming fields in American employment.

Abstract
Since 2021, an estimated half a billion dollars were lost to crypto scams originating from social
media platforms. The main victims of these scams were often younger individuals, who were
three times more susceptible to these scams. With the recent rise of ‘Finfluencers’
1
, individuals
who promote investment advice on social media; young investors are flocking to these platforms
to become financially literate. While investment scams have always existed, the untrackable
nature of cryptocurrency and the influx of personal finance autodidacts creates a perfect
environment for common scams to churn out cash. In this paper , we set out to detect the
distribution of crypto videos and traditional investment YouTube videos recommended to two
age groups. YouTube is chosen over other platforms due to the seamless data pipeline that can be
built on top of its API, something that is harder to do with TikTok for example. The goal of this
audit is not to identify scams on YouTube, but instead to quantify how individuals in varying age
buckets are recommended investment advice.
We approach this by creating three watch histories based on our labels: traditional, crypto, and
mixed. We hypothesize that across all age buckets, users should receive the recommendations
most in line with their labeled watch history .
Introduction
According to the Federal Trade Commission, since the start of 2021, over a billion dollars was
lost to crypto scams with nearly half of the losses originating from a social media
recommendation or advertisement. Within these losses people, ages 20-49 were more than three
times as likely to be scammed as opposed to their older counterparts, with individuals in their
30s being hit the hardest, attributing 35% of fraud losses to crypto since 2021.
2
Accompanying these losses is a rise in the ‘Finfluencer ’ content space. Throughout all social
media platforms, content creators specialized in personal finance, investing, and cryptocurrency
has become increasingly popular .
For this paper , the main platform we’re focusing on is YouTube. The main reasons for choosing
youtube are
1. The seamless data pipeline that can be built on top of its API
2. It was one of the first user -generated video platforms
3. Many videos from other platforms inevitably end up on YouTube and vice-versa

,
however , it has long struggled with dealing with misinformation, something that was highlighted
during the COVID-19 pandemic.
4
In tandem with the
untrackable nature of cryptocurrency , the
inability to moderate misinformation has made crypto scams appear a dime a dozen. As many
influencers rely on sponsorships to run their channels, they may unwittingly promote scams.
Oftentimes, influencers may not be financially literate themselves and often rely on social media
hype to validate their sponsors. This can be seen in cases such as Sam Bankman Fried’ s FTX
5
scandal and Logan Paul’ s NFT  ‘CryptoZoo’
6
. This audit
doesn’ t provide opinions on whether the
individuals tied to these projects/companies are culpable but does use these examples to
highlight how YouTube, social media, and its influencers have played a role in promoting these
scandals.
While there is no way to moderate influencers, due to the sheer scale of YouTube and other
media platforms, we can observe if YouTube’s recommender system is playing a role or not.
Investing is a fundamental part of building a secure lifestyle, and oftentimes a singular scam can
deter an individual from investing further , including ones that have stood the test of time such as
the S&P  500.
7
Motivated to protect young investors,
we set out to characterize and quantify how
YouTube’s recommendations impact investors exposure to assets. In particular , we set out to
answer the following questions:
RQ1.
Can we ef fectively identify if a video is discussing
crypto or traditional
investments?
RQ2.
What is the proportion of videos that are being
recommended to dif ferent age
buckets for each of the labels we identified above on the homepage and video
recommendations section? How does the age bucket our user falls into af fect this and
does it dif fer from what we expect given a user ’s predetermined watch history?
Methodology
There are two major parts to our methodology to consider . To perform our audit, we use the

as a language model to process textual data associated with videos such as
titles, transcripts, and tags.
Audit Methodology
We focus on four labels in this audit: Blockchain, Traditional, Mixed, and None. A video is
considered blockchain if it discusses or recommends any blockchain asset (cryptocurrency ,
NFTs, etc) while a video is considered traditional if it discusses any traditional investing topic
(stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate, IRAs, etc). The mixed label accounts for any videos
discussing both while the none labeled videos account for any other videos (such as Never
Gonna Give You Up - Rick Astley).
According to a previous study , the minimum amount of videos to establish a watch history and
receive personalized recommendations is 22.
10
With
this in mind, we collect 40 videos per label
and label these videos within our group and with our mentor . Due to the scope of this project, it
is dif ficult to collect lar ger amounts of ‘seed videos’  (videos that are used to build watch history).
In a follow-up experiment, we would like to collect more.
Since we’re interested in the ef fects of age, we keep watch history and all other factors consistent
across labels. The two age bucket users we’re creating are ages 18-23 and 55-60. In order to
create these users, we also collect an additional 20 videos that fall into the age bucket for these
users. These videos are once again hand labeled and are videos that a stereotypical individual in
the age bucket would watch. Examples of these videos include: “Asking Reddit what I should
know when I turn 18”, “My first day at College”, “Getting ready for your first Colonoscopy”,
and “Things to do to stay active at 55”.  The videos are selected with the intent of not identifying
a gender , however , due to the timeline and lack of lar ge-scale labeling, it’ s unknown how well
we were able to mitigate these ef fects.

The rationale for creating a watch history for each age is rooted in the idea that YouTube does
not consider the age parameter in your account settings. Oftentimes, ages on YouTube can be
faked, and we assume that YouTube’s recommender system will use the videos watched to
generate an age bucket rather than relying on a user ’s inputted age. Following this logic, we do
not create any accounts.
Using our three labeled watch histories and our two age-bucketed watch histories, we create six
types of users. We have three young users interested in each of the labels and three old users
interested in each of the labels. We conduct the audit by using a web driver to collect home page
recommendations after the watch history every 10 videos after the age seed videos have been
watched (i.e starting from video 20 we return to the homepage, then video 30, etc.). We collect
the top ten recommendations of f of the sidebar for each video that we watch.
Video Classification
Figure 2: Video classification pipeline
In order to classify the recommended videos, we use OpenAI’ s GPT -3.5
11
. We decided to use
GPT-3.5 for reasons including but not limited to: the time constraints of the project, interest in
prompt engineering,  better performance achievable by utilizing an existing model, and
interpretability via prompting. We assessed the accuracy of varying prompts and temperature by
using our seed videos which we labeled and seeing how consistently GPT -3.5 performed. We
originally started with GPT -3 DaV inci as our model engine of choice, however starting March
1st, 2023, OpenAI published GPT3.5 Turbo, which had significant cost reductions and accuracy
improvements.
Designing prompts was critical to reaching high accuracies in our classifier . Unlike traditional
classifiers, our seed video set functioned both as the set used to create watch history and the test
set for our classifier . This is due to the fact that GPT -3.5 does not require a labeled training set
(however it does help to have more data) to fine-tune/train. In the future, given more time, we
would like to fine-tune the model using a training set and testing set. This is something future
researchers can delve into when using GPT  to audit. Given the relatively short lifetime of GPT
3.5, there are many dif ferent ways to approach using it as a classifier that we did not cover .

OpenAI Chat Completion Model
, https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat
Starting from GPT  3.5 prompts are strung together to create a message. The message is sent to
the Chat Completions API where we collect our final prediction. Messages are formatted as
follows:
System: {Prompt to bias our chat completion towards our task}
User: {Messages from our ‘user ’. Can be used to provide further instructions, data, etc.}
Assistant: {Replies from the API. You can leverage pre-written assistant messages to make your
outputs more consistent. Examples are shown below .}
In all of our prompts, we pass in a YouTube video snippet, which is the title concatenated with a
summarized transcript (using TextRank) and the top video tags determined using TF-IDF . It
outputs a predicted label with the probabilities and a short explanation.
We had multiple iterations of dif ferent prompts. We follow a message format starting with a
system message to bias our model towards our task, a user message providing details on our
labels and how-to return formats, and an assistant message to reiterate instructions so our
classifier is more consistent with output. We follow up with one last user message when we make
our API call containing our video snippet. The API returns a completion object with the label
and rationale behind its prediction.
The final prompt we decided to use is shown below:
{""role"":""system"",""content"":
""You are a classifier that determines if a YouTube video snippet falls under a label. A snippet is a concatenation of the video title,summarized transcript, and video tags. The labels and additional instructions will be included in the first user message.""},
{""role"":""user"",""content"":
""""""Labels:
Traditional: Videos that recommend or educate about stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, retirement accounts, or other traditionalinvestments or keywords related to them.Blockchain: Videos that recommend or educate about cryptocurrency (BTC, ETH, etc.), NFTs, or other Web3 investments or keywords related tothem.Mixed: Videos that recommend or educate about both blockchain and traditional investments or keywords related to both.Unrelated: Videos that do not recommend or educate about either blockchain or traditional investments or keywords related to them.
Instructions:- The classifier should consider the context and meaning of the keywords used to determine whether the snippet is related to traditionalor blockchain investments.- If talks about making money from jobs, side hustles, or other alternative assets (cars, watches, artificial intelligence, trading cards,art, etc), they are Unrelated.- A video that is only downplaying an investment or discussing it negatively should be classified as Unrelated.- Please return predictions in the format"" {Label} : {20 word or shorter rationale}""""""},
{""role"":""assistant"",""content"":
""""""Understood. I will classify YouTube video snippets based on the provided labels and instructions. Here's how I will format thepredictions:
{Label} : {20-word or shorter rationale}
Please provide me with the YouTube video snippet you would like me to classify.""""""}Note that across all prompts we use, the system and assistant message stays the same. What we
change is the first user message.
Although our final prompt performed extremely well, earlier iterations of prompts struggled. Our
very first prompt had an accuracy of 51%. We used GPT -3 starting out and migrated to GPT -3.5
later. The first two prompts below were using GPT -3.
I am a YouTube video classifier that takes in video snippets (title + shortened transcript + tags) andoutputs one of the following labels if the video recommends or teaches about:
1. Blockchain: Cryptocurrency, NFTs, or anything related to the blockchain2. Traditional: Stocks, Bonds, Real Estate, Commodities3. Mixed: Both blockchain and traditional investments4. None: Not related to the labels above.
Figure 3: Performance of our baseline prompt
As you can see in Figure 3, our very first prompt did not encourage our model to consider
context or related keywords. It also provided no instructions on return output or edge cases that
may deviate from our intended task.
Binarzing our task results in a substantial increase in the performance of our model. Binarzing
our baseline prompt resulted in an accuracy of 77%. Given more time, we would’ve likely
binarized our final prompt as well. Binarzing allows the main problem to be broken down into
subproblems. By asking it to predict if a video is or isn’ t a label, we can avoid missed predictions
where traditional videos are classified as blockchain and vice-versa. A downside of binarizing is
that token cost, the metric that Open AI uses to char ge users of the GPT  API, is doubled. Also,
our classifier no longer considers both blockchain and traditional when predicting mixed, rather
the predictions of the two prompts are summed together .
# Blockchain Binary PromptI am a YouTube video classifier. Provide me with a video snippet (title + summarized transcript + tags)and I will analyze if the video recommends or teaches about blockchain investments(bitcoin, NFTs,Ethereum, etc). I respond only with Yes and No.
Examples:Snippet: Invest in Index Funds. You should invest in index funds. stocks investingAnswer: No
Snippet: Buy Crypto. You should invest in bitcoin. crypto investAnswer: Yes
Here is the actual task:Snippet:Answer:
# Traditional Binary PromptI am a YouTube video classifier. Provide me with a video snippet (title + summarized transcript + tags)and I will analyze if the video recommends or teaches about traditional investments (stocks, bonds,commodities, real estate, etc). I respond only with Yes and No.
Examples:Snippet: Invest in Index Funds. You should invest in index funds. stocks investingAnswer: Yes
Snippet: Buy Crypto. You should invest in bitcoin. crypto investAnswer: No
Here is the actual task:Snippet:Answer:
Figure 4: Performance of our binarized prompt model
As you can see in Figure 4, there is a substantial increase in the accuracy . Label 0 is unrelated,
label 1 is blockchain, and label 2 is traditional. Label 3 is mixed, the sum of labels 1 and 2.
The prompt below is our first prompt using GPT -3.5. It’ s very similar to our baseline prompt. It
also performed quite similarly , with a 1-2% minor improvement in accuracy .
Labels:
- Blockchain: Cryptocurrency, NFTs, or other Web3 investments- Traditional: Stocks, Bonds, Real Estate, Commodities, or other traditional investments
- Mixed: Videos that recommend or educate about both blockchain and traditional investments- None: Videos that do not recommend or educate about either blockchain or traditional investments
Instructions:
- If a video snippet mentions keywords related to blockchain or traditional investments but does notrecommend or educate about the label, it will be classified as None.- Please return predictions in the format"" {Label} : {50 word or shorter rationale}
The biggest struggle our classifier had was dealing with edge cases. Our prompts often would
hone in on keywords rather than the context of our video snippets. There were many prompts
that led up to the final prompt, however rather than provide each prompt, the snippet below
shows how asking GPT  for rationale provided valuable insight on increasing prompt accuracy .
Prior to adding the following line to our instructions:
A video that is only downplaying an investment or discussing it negatively should beclassified as Unrelated.
Our model classified the following video (only the title is given):
Charlie Munger: Bitcoin is Worthless Rat Poison
With the following label and rationale:
""Blockchain: The snippet mentions Bitcoin, blockchain, and cryptocurrency, which areall related to blockchain investments. Charlie Munger's negative comments aboutBitcoin also suggest that the snippet is related to blockchain investments.""
Although the prompt emphasizes that the video should recommend blockchain to receive a
blockchain label, the classifier struggles to do so, looking only for keywords. When adding the
new instructions, the following output is received instead:
“Traditional: Charlie Munger downplays Bitcoin's value as an investment, stating thatit has no intrinsic value and is not needed as a payment system. He compares it to""rat poison"" and believes that it encourages speculation.""
By inspecting our misclassified seed videos, we can use GPT’ s rationale to modify our prompt
for higher accuracy . There are still faults with this method. Sometimes GPT’ s rationale does not
match its prediction at all, i.e it predicts blockchain with a rationale discussing why it predicted
traditional. Other times GPT’ s rationale may result in a prompt that overfits the seed videos. This
can be avoided by validating the end results of the classifier on the audit data through manual
validation. In the future, given more time, we hope to be able to further tune the prompt and
collect enough seed videos to both ‘train’  our prompt using the rationale strategy and ‘test’  our
prompt using the remaining seed videos.Results
RQ1
Can we ef fectively identify if a video is discussing
or about crypto or traditional
investments?
Using GPT -3.5, we were able to achieve up to 91% accuracy in classifying finance videos.
Figure 5: A confusion matrix showing the performance of our classifier on seed videos.
In Figure 5, the performance of our classifier on seed videos is shown. Our classifier had
extremely high accuracy , struggling the most with mixed videos. Precision and recall on both
blockchain and traditional videos were extremely high, with blockchain predictions being
identified for every video.
RQ2
What is the proportion of videos that are being
recommended to dif ferent age buckets for
each of the labels we identified above on the homepage and video recommendations section?
How does the age bucket our user falls into af fect this and does it dif fer from what we expect
given a user ’s predetermined watch history?
Figures 6 & 7: Classified video recommendations for different populations of audit users
In Figures 6 & 7 we plot the results of video classification on recommendations seen by our
different populations of audit users. Note how blockchain videos are recommended when
blockchain/mixed seed videos are used. This serves to af firm the ef ficacy of our audit and
classification pipelines. In general, we find that blockchain-related videos are not frequently
recommended unless prompted with blockchain seed videos. However , when we get blockchain
video recommendations, they occur at similar rates across age groups, falling in line with what
we hypothesized. Interestingly enough, older individuals actually saw more blockchain videos on
their homepage than younger individuals, but fewer blockchain videos on their sidebars.
We performed Chi-Squared tests to statistically examine the dif ferences between video
recommendations across audit users. For our Chi-Squared tests, we focused on the mixed users,
as they represent the average user . The intent of the blockchain and traditional users was to
observe if an individual who was actively seeking one type of video (say blockchain) would
receive more of the other label due to their age. For example, if we had rejected our null
hypothesis, we would’ve expected younger people to get more blockchain videos. Under that
assumption, it would be odd if our young users who watched a lot of traditional videos got
significantly higher blockchain recommendations while watching these traditional videos
compared to their older counterparts. This was not true, however .
We also discard mixed videos and unrelated videos, only comparing the frequency of traditional
and blockchain videos to reduce the degrees of freedom of our test. Separate tests were
performed for recommendations found on the YouTube homepage (p=0.339), and
recommendations found on the sidebar of the video (p=0.201), neither being statistically
significant. Given more time in the future, we would like to run more statistical tests with higher
degrees of freedom.
Conclusion
We were able to successfully implement a browser automation and video classification pipeline
to perform our audit on the opaque YouTube recommendation system. We did not find
statistically significant results that would suggest that the YouTube recommendation system
recommends one type of investment more to one age group as opposed to another .
Given our limited resources and timeframe, our audit was limited in scope. Expanding the scope
of our audit would be a great next step, across dimensions such as more runs of the audit, audits
with greater “depth” using more seed videos, expansion to other platforms, etc.
We encourage the reproduction of our audit, not only to verify our results but also because it is
reasonable to expect that YouTube recommendations are a constantly changing system. The code
for our auditing pipeline is public and was written with the goal of reproducibility and
reproduction in mind. With the possibility of explicit changes to the system by Google, as well as
the nature of a live recommendation system that continues to collect interaction data from users,
it is important to regularly audit these systems.","The paper discusses an audit of YouTube's recommendation system for investment advice videos, specifically focusing on traditional investments and cryptocurrencies. The goal is to understand how different age groups are recommended these types of videos. The study uses browser automation and video classification techniques to collect and analyze data. The results show that there is no significant difference in the recommendations received by different age groups. The paper concludes by suggesting the need for regular audits of recommendation systems like YouTube's."

Abstract. The China Data Lab at UC San Diego has been investigating the sentiment of Congress
towards China as expressed in Tweets posted by Congress members. Currently, the sentiment analysis
is done manually and the lab seeks to automate this process. Therefore, this project aims to employ
machine learning models to classify: (1) whether the Tweets directly relate to China and (2) if relevant,
what sentiment the Tweets belong to. Initially, this project found that classifying Tweets with a Bernoulli
Naive Bayes model and scoring Tweets with a Ridge or Random Forest Regressor provided the best
results. However, the second portion of this project looks to use the GPT-3 Large Language Model as a
substantially better alternative in its ability to understand and classify text.
Keywords— Large Language Models, GPT-3, China, Sentiment Analysis, Classification
1. Introduction
The growth in China’s socio-political and economic power has established it as a significant challenge to
the United States’ position as the dominant global superpower. Throughout recent history, the two countries
have been allies and rivals, often both at the same time. As a result, the country has become a highly debated
topic among U.S. politicians, with both Democrats and Republicans using discussions of China to mobilize
their voting base. The use of social media platforms, such as Twitter, provides politicians with a global
audience beyond just their constituents. Observing the discourse of American politicians on China on these
platforms can therefore offer valuable insights into current political trends and inform future policy making.
1.1. Literature Review
Past work in this field has been conducted by the University of California San Diego’s China Data Lab who
created the dataset used in this paper as part of their exploration into “how members of Congress tweet about
China” [ 2]. Their work was concerned with a variety of features, like measuring Congressional sentiment
towards China, where tweets were originating from, and what aspects of addressing China does Congress
have bipartisanship over. The work of the China Data Lab was conducted with one notable limitation: much
of the building of the data was done with manual labor done to tag the tweet’s relevance towards China and
assign it a sentiment score on a scale of 1 – 5. This exacerbated the amount of time the task should take and
kept the dataset from growing in real time as more Tweets are posted, which is a problem the China Data
Lab wants to address for future analyses. This paper will address the same two tasks as before – finding
relevancy and scoring sentiment – using trained and optimized machine learning models that reshape text as
easily-digestible vectors of data that can be used in a variety of language processing techniques. The models
will perform at higher speeds and accuracy than completing by hand.2 Gokul Prasad and Annie Fan
Plenty of past work has explored the intersection of social media, politics, and machine learning. Senti-
ment analysis of social media, and Twitter in specific, has been a facet of machine learning exploration for a
long while. State-of-the-art natural language processing models can accurately classify text at unbelievable
speeds, and projects like OpenAI GPT-3 or HuggingFace can generate or summarize text with uncanny
human qualities. With respect to sentiment analysis for Twitter in specific, Sarlan, Nadam, and Basri argue
that applying machine learning techniques and solutions is “more suitable for Twitter” than other styles
of sentiment analysis and opinion mining in text data [ 3]. Furthermore, the language of social media can
vary quite heavily based on who sends a message and in what context the message was sent, so focusing
on vectorizing these Tweets can sharply cut down on the time needed to classify. Twitter itself has a long
history with politics, ever since the Obama campaign used it to generate funds in 2008 to great success. Some
use it to boost their electoral chances, others use it to attack or promote certain views, but most importantly,
Twitter allows all politicians “to discuss their political agenda. . . for free” [ 1]. Whether it is the President or a
local judge, whether the person Tweeting has raised millions in fundraising or none at all, the ability to Tweet
allows them to reach a broad audience with their viewpoints. Social platforms provide an unbelievable spread
of information and audience to users.
1.2. Data
Our team used the data collected by The China Data Lab from Twitter’s API. The dataset contains
Congress Tweets about China, Canada, and Iran. Each row of the dataset contains the text of a Tweet, the
category that the Tweet falls into, the Tweet’s sentiment score, the politician of the Tweet, the politician’s
information, and the id of the Tweet. Tweets about Iran and Canada, which are sampled from all the collected
Tweets for benchmark and comparison purposes, are approximately 20% of the dataset. The team mainly
worked with Congressional Tweets about China in this project.
2. Method
Preparation for the application of an LLM for both classification and sentiment analysis required deep
consideration of which model would suit this project best, as well as deep dives into prompt engineering.
2.1. Exploratory Data Analysis
Prior to applying an LLM, our team first needed to understand the distribution of our data. The dataset is
highly imbalanced in both Tweet relevance and sentiments. Figure 1(a) shows that there are 8718 Tweets
that are relevant to China while only 3130 Tweets are irrelevant. In Figure 1(b), the majority of Tweets in
the dataset have negative sentiments toward China and there is a very small number of neutral and positive
Tweets about China. Figure 1(c) shows the yearly trend of sentiment scores toward China. Every year, the
average score of China-related Tweets from all Congress members (black line) is between 1 and 3, which is
in the negative sentiment range. Republicans (blue line) and Democrats (orange line) take turns having higher
sentiment scores than the other party. For example, Democrats on average had higher sentiment scores toward
China than Republicans did from 2014 to 2016, while Republicans had higher sentiment scores from 2010 to
2012 and in 2017. After 2018, the two parties had similar levels of sentiments every year.Analyzing U.S. Congressional Tweets with OpenAI GPT-3 3

2.2. Model Selection
The incredible advancements in publicly-accessible language models meant that selecting an LLM to
use was an incredibly important first step in this process. While GPT-3 reigns supreme and was eventually
the final choice, there were other capable options that required careful consideration. Most prominently,
there is the BLOOM model, or BigScience Large Open-science Open-access Multilingual Language Model,
developed by Hugging Face Inc., based on existing GPT-2 architecture and deployed as a direct competitor
to GPT-3. However, accessing and building a pathway from our dataset to model input was significantly
easier with GPT-3, and given the models’ similar performances across generation, comprehension, and output
quality, GPT-3 was chosen as the LLM for this project.
Within GPT-3, however, there are several sub-model options: Ada, Babbage, Curie, or Davinci. While all
four options perform well with text comprehension and classification, Davinci was trained on more recent
data, as well as being significantly more capable of understanding specific directions. Given that both the4 Gokul Prasad and Annie Fan
classification and sentiment analysis tasks would require very specific outputs, Davinci was selected as the
model of choice for both tasks.
Fig. 2: Model descriptions from OpenAI documentation
2.3. Tweet Relevance Classification
Thanks to the simplicity of accessing GPT-3 via a simple API call and the model’s underlying ability to
understand unconventional text, like Tweets, there was no cleaning required of the Tweets like there would be
in the usage of a standard supervised machine learning model. As such, much of the work done was creating
and improving the prompts used to generate outputs from GPT-3 by modifying them with concepts like:
1. One-shot Learning: Providing one example per class for the model to learn from
2. Few-shot Learning: Providing multiple examples per class for the model to learn from
The initial prompt passed for classification was very simplistic and did not include any in-context learning,
as a baseline evaluator of GPT’s performance:
Fig. 3: Initial PromptAnalyzing U.S. Congressional Tweets with OpenAI GPT-3 5
After running through the evaluation process, the prompt was then improved to include in-context learning
to show GPT-3 what a correct response was, as well as the reasoning behind the answer, by including the
following examples:
Fig. 4: Refined Prompt
Here, the model is given an expanded purview to digesting Tweets about Iran and Canada beyond just
China; although the overall report is focused solely on Chinese-centric Tweets, providing more examples to
learn from will only improve the model’s performance and understanding.
These prompts were applied to repeated samples of 100 Tweets from the dataset, the answers were cleaned
to remove any extra information, and then compared to the man-made answers. For this particular task, the
chosen metrics was accuracy, and confusion matrices were generated to visualize “pain points” for the model;
these were common areas of disagreements between the human and the model.
2.4. Tweet Sentiment Classification
Data Processing In the original dataset, sentiments of Tweets are evaluated on a five-point scale, with
1 being very negative, 3 being neutral, and 5 being very positive. To reduce the complexity of sentiment
classification, we reduced sentiments into three categories: negative for Tweets with sentiment score 1 and 2,
neutral for Tweets with a sentiment score of 3, and positive for Tweets with score 4 and 5. In addition, some
Tweets from the original dataset have multiple sentiment scores or averaged scores because human coders
had disagreements in evaluating the sentiment of these Tweets. These Tweets are excluded from the training
process in this study in order to reduce ambiguity and complexity of classification tasks.
Running GPT-3 Similar to the relevance classification task, a prompt with the classification task specification,
examples of how the task is expected to be done, and a Tweet to be evaluated is sent to GPT-3. The prompt6 Gokul Prasad and Annie Fan
looks like the following:
""Determine the given tweet’s sentiment toward China. Return either positive, neutral, or negative.
Example 1: ""The humanitarian, security and health threats personified in the coronavirus are being
exacerbated by authoritarian socialist policies and the dishonestly of foreign aggressors and abusers,
like China. https://t.co/CKAtP9qOUT coronavirus"".
Answer: negative.
Reason: The tweet uses explicit negative sentiment towards China through the words such as “dis-
honest”, “aggressor”, and “abuser”.
Given these examples, value the following tweet:""
The actual prompt we used in training includes one example for each sentiment category in order to
provide enough examples and instructions about our expected output for GPT-3. The model would output its
evaluation of the input Tweet’s sentiment toward China, following the format in the examples provided in the
prompt. The team then removed information in the model’s output by extracting the evaluated sentiment -
either positive, neutral, or negative. The metric the team used to measure the model’s performance is accuracy
of the model’s classification.
In order to compare the GPT-3 model with machine learning models the team previously experimented
with, our team also trained a Random Forest Classifier on a balanced dataset - that is, we downsampled the
number of negative Tweets to 135, which is the number of positive Tweets. The train-test split ratio used is
75% to 25%. We used default model parameters from Sklearn.
Data Sampling Again, the prompt is run on repeated samples of Tweets from the dataset in order to optimize
our usage of GPT-3. For each trial, the team sampled 10-30 Tweets per sentiment category and ran the model
on the sampled data Tweet by Tweet.
3. Result
3.1. Relevance
The chosen metric of evaluation for the model was accuracy, and further visualization of model output
via a confusion matrix. In contrast to last quarter where the metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, and
F-1 scores, the lack of imbalance issues in GPT-3 rendered calculating metrics beyond accuracy somewhat
pointless since the model was not being ‘trained’ in the same sense as a supervised model. A detailed table of
the model’s performance by prompt can be seen below:Analyzing U.S. Congressional Tweets with OpenAI GPT-3 7

5Command + 3 examples + 2 ‘pain-points’ +

(Each prompt was run several fifteen times on samples of 100 Tweets at random.
More information on the prompts can be found in the appendix.)
An example confusion matrix from Trial 4 can be seen below, demonstrating an accuracy of 68%. Even
though the prompt was later tuned and accuracy later improved, the confusion matrix reveals a common issue
to the GPT-3 model that persisted throughout all five trials: Tweets that were marked by the human encoder
as irrelevant were often judged as relevant by the model.
In comparison with the results we had obtained from the first quarter, these results fall well short of
expected outputs. While the GPT-3 model did not have to contend with the problems of balancing and class
distribution that the supervised models, it still struggled with some Tweets based on their interpretation by the
human encoders.
3.2. Sentiment
On each training trial on a sample of 100 Tweets, the GPT-3 model can achieve between 60% and
70% accuracy in classifying Tweet sentiments. According to the confusion matrix in Figure 6(a), the model
performed best in classifying Tweets with positive sentiment. The model had the lowest accuracy in classifying
neutral Tweets and struggled in distinguishing neutral Tweets with positive and negative Tweets. On the other
hand, the Random Forest Classifier achieved approximately 55% accuracy. From the confusion matrix in
Figure 6(b), Random Forest’s accuracy of classifying each sentiment class was all lower than the performance
of the GPT-3 model.8 Gokul Prasad and Annie Fan

4. Discussion
4.1. GPT-3 in Classifying Tweet Relevance
In comparison with the results from Quarter 1, the output of GPT-3 fell well short in the measured metrics.
Specifically, while the supervised Naive Bayes classifier could consistently reach accuracies greater than 90%,
the LLM only achieved a peak of 75%, and even then after extended prompt engineering. While this was
disappointing, it is important to consider why these discrepancies are occurring, because LLMs like GPT-3
have proven to be far more capable than traditional machine learning models in a variety of usage cases
beyond simple classification. Examining the consistent pain-point of a Tweet categorized as irrelevant while
the model predicts relevance, it can be seen that GPT-3 is simply suffering from a natural human difference in
understanding context and intent in text. While the supervised ML models are simply fitting themselves onto
a dataset, the accuracy is high since it takes the provided labels as absolute truth, and so learns to embed and
read the Tweets through that singular lens. However, GPT-3, being an LLM, actually understands the Tweet
on its own, and much like the human encoders who created the dataset of Tweets, can have a different reading
of some particular Tweet that causes it to output a different label. Class imbalances are of no concern since
GPT-3 does not necessarily need to be trained, and can be taught to evaluate or consider information in its own
context. As such, despite the poorer comparative performance, it seems clear that this initial experimentation
gives weight to the argument that GPT-3 has a stronger future in this field; its malleability to any text can
transform these problems from basic classification to deeper text comprehension and analysis on its own.Analyzing U.S. Congressional Tweets with OpenAI GPT-3 9
4.2. GPT-3 in Classifying Tweet Sentiment
The GPT-3 model yields better performance in classifying sentiment than the Random Forest Classifier. In
order to minimize the bias caused by the imbalanced dataset and optimize the performance of Random Forest
Classifier, we needed to balance the dataset by downsampling the majority class and excluding approximately
90% of the data from the training process. As a result, training machine learning classifiers such as Random
Forest is costly given the limitation of our imbalanced dataset. Comparatively, GPT-3 is a more appropriate op-
tion for our data because it evaluates each Tweet independently and thus is not affected by the imbalanced data.
During the process of applying GPT-3 in classifying sentiment, GPT-3 showed good performance in
classifying Tweets that expressed explicit sentiments toward China. However, GPT-3 often struggled with
currently classifying Tweets that include implicit sentiment toward China and confused these Tweets with
neutral Tweets. When evaluating Tweets with implicit sentiments and neutral Tweets, GPT-3 had significant
disagreements with the evaluation from the human grader. For example, one of the misclassified Tweets
with implicit sentiment is “Your GhostFleet read of the week is the new @CNASdc report on China’s
pursuit of quantum dominance. This is a vital competition for technological superiority we cannot afford to
lose.” The human coder evaluated the sentiment of this Tweet as negative because the Tweet is about the
competition against China and thus it implies negative sentiment toward China. GPT-3’s output to this Tweet
is neutral and its reasoning is that “The tweet expresses the importance of competition between China and
the US for technological superiority, but does not explicitly express any opinion about China.” As a result,
despite GPT-3’s capability in understanding text sentiments, it still has substantial differences with human
interpretation.
4.3. Conclusion of Project
The application of GPT-3 to this problem suffered from the same problems that plagued the first quarter’s
results; namely, that this entire problem relies heavily on subjectivity and human interpretation. Disagreements
between the human and programmatic classifiers are likely to never be fully worked out – LLMs learn from
human input, and so natural differences in interpretation or preexisting beliefs can be a major influence on
the result. However, this process shows that there definitely is a place for LLM-usage in Tweet analysis,
and that with more time, the result could be improved. The simplification to the process and the removal of
imbalancing issues clearly made this a more powerful option than using supervised ML models.
4.4. The Future of Language Modeling
Large Language Models like GPT-3 are undoubtedly the future of language processing and modeling:
one only needs to look how quickly ChatGPT was popularized and made accessible to the broader public,
as well as the quick creation of competing models like Bard by Google or LLaMa by Meta.. However, it is
important to note that these models are not a magic solution and do require significant subject matter expertise
to achieve consistent high-quality outputs.
One of the primary challenges with LLMs is their ability to generate coherent and accurate outputs that
align with the specific context and requirements of the task at hand. While these models have the ability to
learn from vast amounts of data and generate impressive outputs, their effectiveness largely depends on how
well they are fine-tuned to the specific task and the domain in which they are being applied. This is where
subject matter expertise comes into play.10 Gokul Prasad and Annie Fan
Experts in a given field possess a wealth of knowledge and understanding of the nuances and complexities
of that domain. This expertise is essential for designing prompts that accurately convey the task requirements
and constraints, as well as fine-tuning the model’s parameters to generate relevant and meaningful outputs.
Without this expertise, LLMs may generate outputs that are irrelevant, inaccurate, or even harmful in certain
contexts.
Furthermore, subject matter expertise is also critical for evaluating the outputs generated by LLMs.
Experts can provide feedback on the accuracy and relevance of the outputs and can identify errors or biases
that may have been introduced by the model. This feedback is important for refining and improving the model
and ensuring that it continues to produce high-quality outputs over time.
In addition to subject matter expertise, it is also important to consider the ethical implications of LLMs.
As these models become more widely adopted and integrated into various applications, there is a risk that
they may perpetuate biases and reinforce existing power structures if not carefully designed and monitored.
Therefore, it is essential that experts work closely with developers and stakeholders to ensure that LLMs are
developed and applied in an ethical and responsible manner.

Abstract
The US-China relationship is changing rapidly. To better understand its dynamics,
monitoring and analyzing Twitter data posted by members of Congress becomes
important. Before analyzing the tweets, there is a need to distinguish the sen-
timental posts from the factual posts and provide them with labels of different
sentiment levels. Currently, there have been two classifiers trained using the text
features from the tweets to predict the relevance and sentiment of the tweets. The
goal of this project is to explore the possibility of employing an active learning
pipeline to automate the labeling procedure with these two classification mod-
els while enhancing the prediction accuracy over time with new coming tweets.
After investigating the effectiveness of Active Learning, we found that Posterior
probability-based sampling strategy is more effective in identifying informative
data for model updating. Moreover, our study found that unbalanced data leads to
consistent improvements in metric differences, but this also results in a bias toward
the oversized category. Sorting data by time has a minor impact on accuracy but
leads to higher recall. The partition ratio among the training, unlabeled, and test
sets suggests that the optimal model is the one with the most training and unlabeled
data. Additionally, increasing the sampling size leads to improvements in most
metrics. The most accurate models is a Random Forest Classifier with an 80%
accuracy for relevance prediction and a Ridge Logistic Regression with accuracies
of approximately 75%, 44%, and 67% for negative, neutral, and positive sentiment
labels, respectively.
1 Introduction
1.1 Background
In April 2019, the China Data Lab at UC San Diego initialized the “Congress Tweets” project with
the intention of exploring more about the US-China relationship. Through the Twitter API, the lab is
able to collect more than 800,000 tweets related to China, posted by members of Congress in recent
years. However, not all of them can be used directly to infer about the political relationship between
the US and China as some of the tweets contain solely factual information related to China without a
direct sentiment. In order to distinguish the relevant sentimental tweets from the factual tweets, we
built two classification models using the content of the tweet to predict the relevance and sentiment
score of the tweets. By automating the process, we can save resources such as human labor and time
as well as ensuring the quality of the data we feed into the analysis process. Prior to deploying the
models, the subsequent step is to investigate the method of active learning with incoming data to
guarantee the accuracy of the predictions.

1071.2 Literature review and prior work
According to Active Learning Literature Survey from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, in the
field of machine learning, Active Learning is a repetitive process that utilizes a learning algorithm
to search for the most informative data for the existing model, rather than training it on the entire
dataset.
There are three general learning scenarios for active learning. In Member Query Synthesis, the active
learning algorithm generates a new unlabeled instance within the input space and queries the human
expert for labeling. In Stream-based Selective Sampling, the unlabeled data is continuously being sent
from the data source to the active learner and the active learning needs to decide if it asks the human
expert to label the current data based on a query strategy. In Pool-based Sampling, the most common
scenario, most informative data samples are selected from the pool of unlabeled data samples based
on some sampling strategies or informativeness measure. Then, the human expert will provide the
correct label for these unlabeled data samples. Different from stream-based selective sampling, it
focuses on more than one data sample at a time.
In the next step, we will determine how to select the subset of data that is most informative to the
current model and there are three main types of sampling strategies for active learning based on
Hardik Dave’s findings. In Committee-based Strategies, we will build different models and use
the models’ predictions to determine the most informative data. The data is considered as most
informative if there is maximum disagreement in predictions from the models. The disagreement
can be measured by entropy or KL-Divergence. In Large margin-based Strategies, the distance
to the separating hyperplane is used to measure the model’s confidence or certainty on unlabeled
data. In Posterior probability-based strategies, the estimation of class probabilities and the posterior
probability distribution are used to determine whether the unlabeled data sample should be queried
for label or not. This strategy can be used with any type of model which has the ability to predict
output probabilities for class membership. The posterior probability distribution indicates the model’s
confidence and certainty to assign the data sample to a particular class. For Posterior probability-
based strategies, some common strategies to determine the most informative data samples from the
probability distribution include Least Confidence, Best-versus-Second-Best (BvSB), and Entropy.

1.3 Relevant data
The twitter data for this project consists of three parts of information. The first part is the original
tweet data which includes the tweet id, author, content, post date, etc. The second part is about the
congress politicians who posted the tweets which include their name, birthday, states of representative,
political party, etc. The third part is the labels that researchers provide to the tweets subjectively. For
example, the columns include the countries the tweet is associated with, whether the tweet is factual
or sentimental, and the sentiment score for the content. Our goal is to build two classification models
and apply natural language processing to predict the third part of the data which was previously
labeled manually. The twitter data consists of 15846 rows and 14544 unique tweets. Since the tweets
were sent to different researchers to label and then aggregated together, there are duplicated tweets
with different labels for relevance and sentiment score. The date of the tweets range from 2009 to
2021 and there are a total of 568 unique politicians who have posted any tweets in our datasets. The
politicians with the largest number of posts in our dataset are Marsha Blackburn with 451 tweets,
Marco Rubio with 433 tweets, and Jim Banks with 416 tweets. In terms of partisanship, Republicans
have 10420 tweets compared to Democrats with 3889 tweets. In terms of state, Texas, Florida,
Tennessee, California are the states with the most number of tweets. The age of politicians form a
normal distribution where the age of most of the active members of Congress lie between 50 and
70. Some popular topics extracted from the tweets include human rights, communist party, sanction,
national security, and coronavirus. There are also many other countries and areas mentioned in the
tweets which include the United States, Canada, Iran, Hong Kong, Russia, and North Korea.

1612 Methods
2.1 Data Collection
The tweet data was provided by the researchers in the China Data Lab. For the scope of this project,
we filter the dataset by the associated country and only select the tweets that are associated with
China.
2.2 Data Preprocessing
The relevance column contained different group labels. Label 1 stands for the tweets expressing
sentiment to the country of interest. Label 2 stands for tweets that express sentiment and mention
the country, but the sentiment is not directed towards the country. Label 3 stands for the tweets that
express no sentiment of any form. They are factual tweets that mention the country of interest. For
our task, we mainly focused on building a classifier to distinguish label 1 from the rest of the labels.
Therefore, to ensure all the predictive labels are standardized, we transformed the relevance label into
a set of binary labels, ‘1’ and ‘2 or 3’. Because the tweet data were previously manually labeled by
different researchers, there were cases when the tweets do not have a label or have multiple labels. In
our case, we decide to remove these portions of the data as they would affect our models’ prediction
accuracy. In addition, we removed duplicated tweets because the data was aggregated by different
researchers.
The sentiment column ranges from 0 to 5 and represents the sentiment of the tweet toward Chinese
people or the Chinese government. A score of 0 stands for the most negative and a score of 5
represents the most positive. For data preprocessing, we first removed the tweets that do not have
a sentiment score. Then, we averaged the sentiment scores for each unique tweet by different
researchers. Because we want to ensure the training data we feed into the models are correct, we
eliminated those samples with decimal points due to their ambiguity. After that, we converted the
numerical values into three categorical sentiments. A score between 0 and 2 will be classified as
Negative. A score between 2 and 4 will be classified as Neutral. A score between 4 and 6 will be
considered as Positive.
After we cleaned up the predictive labels for the data, we converted the content of the tweet to
lowercase, removing the symbols, links, punctuation, and stopwords. Following that, we lemmatized
the content to output a cleaned version of the text. After we cleaned up the text, we transformed the
cleaned text into a large language matrix using the bag of words and TF-IDF vectorizer.
2.3 Models
When using the Committee-based Strategies, we included Support Vector Classifier, K Nearest Neigh-
bor Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier as the members
in the model selection committees. When using the Posterior probability-based strategies, we tried
Bernoulli and Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression (Ridge),
and Logistic Regression (Lasso). To compare the model performance, we recorded the accuracy,
precision, recall, F1 score, and specificity for each model trial with different hyperparameters.
2.4 Active Learning
To find the most effective active learning strategies for our tasks, we implemented both Committee-
based Strategies and Posterior probability-based strategies with different settings. The settings we
tuned include the number samples we draw from the unlabeled data, data partition ratio, whether or
not the data is balanced, whether or not the data is sorted by time, and different models. The first step
of active learning is to partition the dataset based on the settings we chose. We will partition the entire
dataset into three groups. The first group is called Seed, which is used for training the initial model.
The second group is called Unlabeled, which is used for active learning. The third group is called Test,
which is used for testing the result of active learning compared with random sampling. The second
step of active learning is to train the model using Seed data. We will train the assigned classification
model using Seed data and apply cross validation to find the consistent accuracy. The third step of
the process is to apply the trained model to the unlabeled dataset and choose a batch of unlabeled

instances from the pool based on the selected sampling strategy. For Committee-based Strategies, the
most informative data will be selected using the entropy from the different models’ predictions. For
Posterior probability-based strategies, the most informative data will be chosen through the entropy
calculated from the probability distribution provided by the existing model on the unlabeled dataset.
After we find the most informative data from the unlabeled pool, we will add them to the original
Seed data and retrain the model. The last step of active learning is to compare the model performance
of our active learning process on the test set. In our case, we will compare the model accuracy,
f1-score, recall, precision, specificity achieved by employing the active learning techniques with
model metrics generated from the random sampling approach to validate the effectiveness of our
active learning method in our predictive tasks.
3 Results
3.1 One-Tailed Paired T-Tests
We utilized several One-tailed Paired T-tests to compare the efficacy of various active learning
sampling strategies with the random sampling strategy. Our null hypothesis posited that there would
be no discernible difference between the mean values of the evaluation metrics (accuracy, f1-score,
precision, recall, and specificity) obtained through random sampling versus those obtained through
active learning sampling strategies. Our alternative hypothesis, however, was that the mean value of
the evaluation metrics obtained through active learning sampling strategy would be superior to that of
the random sampling strategy. Given the objective of determining whether active learning improved
the accuracy of predictions, we conducted four one-tailed paired t-tests. Subsequently, we generated
tables that included relevant columns such as mean, standard deviation, t-test statistic, and p-value, to
document the results of our experiments.

3.3 Most accurate vs. Most improved models
Regarding the task of predicting relevance, the optimal classifier trained with balanced data was
found to be a Random Forest Classifier, which yielded a positive class accuracy of approximately
80%. With respect to sentiment prediction, the most accurate classifier trained with balanced data
was determined to be a Ridge Logistic Regression, exhibiting respective accuracies of roughly 75%,

both classifiers is presented in Figure 9. Additionally, Figure 10 portrays an overall improvement
of around 0.16 for accuracy, 0.11 for precision, and 0.16 for recall in the sentiment prediction task.
Conversely, the relevance prediction task demonstrated an overall improvement of approximately

4314 Discussion
4.1 Posterior probability vs. Committee based sampling strategy
The present study aimed to investigate the impact of Active Learning on predictive accuracies
by conducting an experiment employing various settings and sampling strategies, and comparing
multiple evaluation metrics, including Accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and specificity. The
study hypothesized that committee-based sampling strategy would have a greater positive effect on
predictions due to its incorporation of multiple classifiers, leading to less biased and more robust
predictions. However, the results of the experiment contradicted this hypothesis. Specifically, the
results suggested that the Posterior probability-based sampling strategy successfully identified the
most informative data for continuous model updating.
Further analysis revealed that incorporating the predictions of multiple classifiers provided a more
robust and less variable estimate of uncertainty, resulting in improved accuracy. Thus, calculating
the entropy based on the average of classifiers’ predictions did not lead to a significant increase in
accuracy. The p-values obtained in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4 indicated that the Posterior
probability-based sampling strategy was associated with significantly smaller p-values compared to
the Committee-based sampling strategy. Using a confidence level of 0.05, it can be concluded that
the active learning process led to significant increases in accuracy, f1-score, recall, and specificity.
However, at the same confidence level, the null hypothesis could not be rejected when employing the
Committee-based sampling strategy.
Finally, it is worth noting that although the Posterior probability-based sampling strategy resulted in
improved predictions, the magnitude of the increase was not substantial, ranging from 0.001 to 0.007.
4.2 Features that affect the Active Learning Performance
In the conducted experiment, we employed a number of settings to fine-tune the active learning
process and investigate their impact on its performance. These settings included the use of balanced
or unbalanced datasets with respect to predictive labels, sorting data by date, partitioning of the data
into training, unlabeled, and testing sets, and the number of samples drawn from the unlabeled data
and added to the training set. Prior to the experiment, we hypothesized that a larger sampling size
with a smaller training set would yield the greatest improvement in active learning performance. The
results of our experiment supported this hypothesis.
Specifically, in the task of relevance prediction, we observed that increasing the sampling size led to
an improvement in overall accuracy, as shown in Figure 7. We also found that having a training set
comprising only 10% of the total data, with the remaining 90% divided equally between the unlabeled
and testing sets, resulted in the greatest accuracy improvements for active learning. Additionally,
the Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classifier emerged as the most promising model selection option, with
accuracy improvements continuing to increase as the sampling size increased to 600.
However, while our results were aligned with our hypothesis for relevance prediction, we observed a
less clear trend in the case of sentiment prediction. Specifically, Figure 8 demonstrated that there was
no significant difference in evaluation metrics between the Ridge Logistic Regression, Multinomial
Naive Bayes, and Random Forest Classifier models. Moreover, the accuracy difference for the
Lasso Logistic Regression model exhibited irregular changes with increasing sampling size. We thus
concluded that active learning may not work as effectively for sentiment prediction using existing
feature variables and models.
To further investigate the impact of balanced and unbalanced datasets on active learning, we plotted
accuracy differences over sampling size in Figures 3 and 5. Our findings showed that unbalanced
datasets resulted in a continuously increasing trend in accuracy difference as the sampling size
increased, while the variance of the accuracy difference narrowed for both relevance and sentiment
prediction tasks. This led us to believe that retaining the original label ratio during the training
process could have a more significant effect on active learning performance.
Regarding the impact of sorting data by time on active learning, we plotted accuracy differences
over sampling size in Figures 4 and 6. In both cases, we observed that the variances for sorted and
unsorted data were significant and did not lead to a continuous improvement in evaluation metrics

485as the sampling size increased. Our conclusion was that while sorting data by time may result in a
marginally lower accuracy, it leads to a higher recall.
4.3 Most Accurate and most improved models through Active Learning
The primary objective of our project is to optimize the accuracies of both relevance and sentiment
predictions. Our exploratory analysis indicated that training with unbalanced data yields higher
accuracies, exceeding 90%, as the sample size increases. However, it results in lower recall. Therefore,
we adopted a balanced dataset for evaluating the best models, to avoid bias towards labels with more
samples.
Our experiments indicate that the Random Forest Classifier, trained on non-chronological data with
Posterior probability-based sampling strategy, achieved the best performance for relevance prediction,
with a training set of 90%, an unlabeled set of 5%, and a testing set of 5%. It achieved an accuracy of
approximately 80% for the labels.
For sentiment prediction, the best model was the Logistic Regression (Ridge) model, trained on
chronological data with Posterior probability-based sampling strategy, with a training set of 50%, an
unlabeled set of 25%, and a testing set of 25%. It achieved accuracies of 75%, 44%, and 67% for
negative, neutral, and positive sentiment labels, respectively. Specific accuracy data are available in
figure 8.
Figure 9 demonstrates an overall improvement of approximately 0.16 for accuracy, 0.11 for precision,
and 0.16 for recall in the sentiment prediction task. In contrast, the relevance prediction task
demonstrated an overall improvement of approximately 0.04 for accuracy, 0.045 for precision, and
0.002 for recall.
The relative high improvement in the Sentiment prediction task is due to the high variance in
predictions with different settings, as observed from figures 4 and 6. Therefore, while active learning
does increase accuracy to a small extent, these improvements may be attributed to randomness and
cannot be considered a significant enhancement.
5 Conclusion
5.1 Summary
This research project investigates the potential of employing Active Learning as a means of improving
relevance and sentiment prediction. The study utilizes One-Tailed Paired T-Tests to evaluate the ef-
fectiveness of two sampling strategies: Posterior probability-based and Committee-based. The results
indicate that the former approach successfully identifies the most informative data for continuous
model updating, whereas the latter does not lead to increased accuracy in the studied case.
Furthermore, the study finds that utilizing unbalanced data produces a more robust and consistent
improvement in metric differences. However, this also results in a bias toward the oversized category
in the final prediction result. Sorting data by time has a minor impact on accuracy but leads to a
higher recall. The partition ratio among the training, unlabeled, and test sets suggests that the optimal
model is one with the most training and unlabeled data.
Additionally, increasing the sampling size yields overall improvements in most metrics. The most
accurate models identified in this study are a Random Forest Classifier with an 80% accuracy for
relevance prediction and a Ridge Logistic Regression with accuracies of approximately 75%, 44%,
and 67% for negative, neutral, and positive sentiment labels, respectively.
In light of these findings, if incorporating Active Learning in a production pipeline in the future, the
Posterior probability-based sampling strategy should be prioritized, and balanced datasets with large
sampling sizes should be employed.
5.2 Limitation and Future Direction
The experiment has several limitations, including a lack of diverse input variables, models, and
labeled data. Specifically, the experiment only used count vectors and TF-IDF vectors as input

counts, sentiment score of the sentence, or part-of-speech tagging could improve prediction accuracy.
The experiment used basic classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest
with a Posterior probability-based sampling strategy for model selection. However, future work could
explore more advanced models like XGBoost or AdaBoost to enhance the learning process. The
results from the experiment were variable, potentially due to the limited sample size and unbalanced
distribution of labeled data. Acquiring more labeled data in both relevance and sentiment categories
could lead to a better-trained model and improved learning ability. It is also acknowledged that
human error in data labeling may impact the effectiveness of active learning. Future research will
focus on testing additional combinations of features and models, exploring various settings and
hyperparameters, and incorporating the results with the ChatGPT group to better serve the study
needs.

Abstract
Many text classification models rely on the
assumption that requires users to provide the
model with a full set of class labels. This is
not realistic, as users may not be aware of all
possible classes in advance, or may not be able
to obtain an exhaustive list. These models also
forced to predict any new document to one of
the existing classes, where none of the exist-
ing labels is a good fit. Thus, we explore the
Incomplete TextClassification (IC-TC) setting:
Models mine patterns in a small labeled set
which only contains existing labels, apply pat-
terns to predict into existing labels in an un-
labeled set, and detect out-of-pattern clusters
for potential new label discoveries. We exper-
iment with the potential of weakly supervised
ML to detect class labels that humans may not
recognize, thus facilitating more accurate clas-
sification. From the document and class embed-
dings and unconfident documents generated,
we found that both the baseline and the final
model had some capability of detecting unseen
classes, and label generation techniques help
produce reasonable new class labels.
1 Introduction
In recent years, with the growing complexity and
scale of neural network models, they also require
more high-quality human-annotated training data
to achieve satisfactory performances. These ac-
tions usually require extensive domain expertise
and are extremely time-consuming. Researchers
have strived to develop models in the weak su-
pervision setting that aim to gradually alleviate
the human burden in creating such annotations for
the documents. In particular, researchers have ap-
proached the problem of text classification by devel-
oping models that only require the class labels and
a little extra information for each class label such
as (1) a few representative words (i.e. seed words);
(2) authors, publication date, etc. (i.e. metadata).
Researchers have shown that models are capable
of obtaining reliable results without full human
annotation.
However, the problem setting for these models
all depend on one key assumption: users need toprovide the model with a full set of desired class la-
bels for the model to consider. This is less realistic
as users might not know all possible classes in ad-
vance; users are also unable to obtain an exhaustive
list of class names without carefully reading and an-
alyzing the documents. If some documents happen
to fall outside of the given list, the models will be
forced to predict one of the existing classes based
on normalized probability (e.g. the last softmax
layer for a neural network).
For example, an online article database might
contain thousands of user-uploaded articles labeled
with their domains: news, sports, computer science,
etc., and the labels are only limited to existing arti-
cles. When trying to classify new documents, there
might be some classes existing in our documents
whose labels are not provided by our database. For
instance, we may have a group of articles in the
domain of chemistry, while we don’t have the exact
label “chemistry” in the database yet.
In this paper, we explore the Incomplete Text
Classification (IC-TC) setting: Models mine pat-
terns in a small labeled set which only contains ex-
isting labels, apply patterns to predict into existing
labels in an unlabeled set, and detect out-of-pattern
clusters for potential new label discoveries. We try
to explore the possibility of utilizing the power of
machines to detect class labels that humans fail to
recognize and classify documents to more reason-
able labels. In particular, we proposed a baseline
model and an advanced model that both leverage
semi-supervised and unsupervised learning meth-
ods to extract information from the labeled part of
the dataset, learn patterns from the unlabeled part,
and generate new labels based on documents that
have lower similarity between their representation
and existing class labels. From the experiments on
a well-balanced dataset, both models are perform-
ing relatively well in learning high-quality seed
words, word embeddings, class and document em-
beddings, and detecting unseen clusters of classes.
With the help of the modern large language model
ChatGPT, the models are also capable of finding
generic labels for the new classes.Table 1: Dataset Statistics
Dataset # Docs # Classes Avg # Words
DBPedia 560,000 14 50.01
NYT-Fine 11,527 26 648.24
Reddit 48,407 20 24.11
2 Data
2.1 Datasets
We picked data from 3 categories: news, social me-
dia, and Wikipedia. The basic statistics are shown
in 1.
•The New York Times (nyt-fine): The NYT
dataset consists of news articles published by
the New York Times, and is reused from the
ConWea paper (Mekala and Shang, 2020).
There are 26 fine-grained categories which
are stemmed from coarse grained labels (omit-
ted), and the number of documents follow a
long-tailed distribution.
•DBPedia: The articles come from topic clas-
sifications based on Wikipedia pages, and is
reused from LOTClass (Meng et al., 2020)
and X-Class (Wang et al., 2021). There are 14
perfectly balanced classes and a large number
of documents.
•Reddit: The Reddit dataset contains social
media posts from Reddit, which includes the
post titles and descriptions. There are 20
classes following a long-tailed distribution.
2.2 Label Removal
We obtain a fully labelled dataset and remove part
of the labels to conform with our task setting. We
first obtain ndocuments {D1, D2, . . . , D n}which
are each labelled with one of the classes c1, . . . , c m,
and let fbe a mapping from the documents to the
labels. We assume the frequency of class labels
follow a long-tailed distribution, for example Zipf’s
Law. Let the frequency of the labels be fi= #{k:
f(Dk) =i}, where the labels are ranked by their
frequency in descending order.
In the incomplete setting, we also assume: (1)
new labels failed to be provided by users all come
from less frequent classes; (2) the less frequent,
the more likely that it’s missed from the users. To
create datasets of such a setting, we sample labels
from the less frequent half:From labels cm/2+1, . . . , c m, we sample llabels
from the discrete distribution for each iin the bot-
tom half:
P(X=i) =1/f(i)
mP
j=m/2+11/f(j)
Finally, from the remaining labels, we remove
the same percentage pof labels from documents to
gain our final data set.
3 Problem
We attempt to perform text classification under the
setting which requires fewer human effort: the in-
put class label set is only a proper subset of all pos-
sible labels being predicted. This setting is more
realistic because in most use cases users wish to
classify their own unannotated corpus with some
expectation and some labeled data, and the end task
is to complete the labels for the entire corpus.
We present the full problem statement. The “in-
complete” supervision takes in a set of documents
D={D1, . . . , D n}, a user-provided set of de-
sired class labels c∗={c1, . . . , c m∗}, and a set
of labels for the first kdocuments l1, . . . , l k∈c∗
The task is to suggest new possible class names
cm∗+1, . . . , c m/∈c∗to form the full label set
c={c1, . . . , c m}and assign a reasonable label
lj∈cforj∈k+ 1, . . . , n for the remaining unla-
beled documents. In total, we will predict one of
themlabels for n−kdocuments given m∗original
labels and klabeled documents.
4 Evaluation
Since the model generates newly suggested labels
that are likely to not exist in the original set of full
labels, we design the following evaluation process
to assess the quality of newly generated labels as
well as aggregated classification performance. The
term “existing label” refers to the ground truth for
documents that exist in the labeled part, and thus
will exist in the unlabeled part; in contrary, “newly
generated label” refers to ground truths that only
exist in the unlabeled part (i.e. is removed during
the label removal process).
As described in the models, we allow each docu-
ment to first select from the existing labels before
moving towards generating new labels. Our evalua-
tion process follow a similar multi-step framework
to aim on different parts of the model.Figure 1: Model Pipeline Illustration
4.1 Binary Classification
The model decides on whether to generate new la-
bels for a document based on the confidence of
weak supervised document-class representations.
The sub-task of predicting whether a document
falls outside of existing classes is a binary classifi-
cation prediction. We evaluate this sub-task using
binary precision and recall, with “new labels nec-
essary” as the positive class.
4.2 Existing Label Performance
Based on all documents that have ground truth as
existing labels, we evaluate the multi-class classifi-
cation using the micro- and macro-F1 scores.
4.3 New Label Inspection
After new labels are generated, we inspect the qual-
ity of new labels using either manual inspection,
and plot word clouds comparing the significant
words appeared in the original removed classes and
the new clustered classes with generated labels.
5 Method
Figure 1 illustrates the model pipeline for both of
the baseline and the final models. The models for
the incomplete setting start from a set of labeled
documents and another set of unlabeled documents,
and mainly contain 4 modules: (1) learning word
embeddings from the documents; (2) using word
embeddings to find document and class representa-
tions; (3) confidence split based on document-class
similarity; (4) clustering unconfident documents
and generate new labels.
The pipeline utilizes all available documents to
find better word representations and makes sure
each unlabeled document would have the opportu-
nity to first pick from the existing classes before
claiming that it doesn’t belong to any of the exist-
ing ones. This allows one to substitute high-quality
word embedding techniques developed by previ-
ous research, and use any supervised learning tech-nique for finding document-class relationships. We
choose to use the simple similarity-based method
because it helps further reduce human efforts to
only provide a subset of class names without any
labeled documents, similar to X-Class (Wang et al.,
2021), as producing high-quality labeled docu-
ments still requires extensive efforts.
In both of the models, we utilized the following
shared techniques:
•Seed Words : Extract the top 10 unique words
per label from TF-IDF scores and create a
seed-word set. To ensure the quality and ac-
curacy of the seed-word sets, if two labels
share a common seed-word, it is removed and
replaced with the label’s following most fre-
quent words.
•Class Representation : Average embedding
of extracted seed words:
vl=1
|Sl|X
s∈Slvs
where Slis the seed word set for label l.
•Document Representation : Average embed-
ding of each word in the document. We
choose to use averaged words to align with
class representations. In particular, we aggre-
gate the vector representations:
vd=1
|Wd|X
w∈Wdvw
where Wdis the words in document d.
•Similarity : Using the notations above, the
cosine similarity score sd,lbetween the class
land the document dis computed by
sd,l=⟨vl, vd⟩
∥vl∥ · ∥vd∥
then for each document dwe obtain the max-
imum similarity ˆsdand the class associated
with the maximum ˆldover all classes l∈L:
ˆsd= max
l∈Lsd,l,ˆld= argmax
l∈Lsd,l
•Confident Split : By inspecting the distribu-
tion of maximum similarities, we manually
set a threshold τso that any document with
ˆsd≥τis considered close to the existingclass and is predicted to be class ˆld. Any other
document with ˆsd< τ is considered to be
relatively less relevant to existing classes, and
its document representation vdis extracted to
form the unconfident set.
•Clustering : Once obtained the unconfident
set, we run a Gaussian Mixture clustering
model with default 5 classes. Gaussian Mix-
ture is a probabilistic model-based soft clus-
tering algorithm. For our representations
V={v1, . . . , v n}of the nunconfident doc-
uments, the objective function to maximize
is:
P(V|C) =nY
i=1P(vi|C) =nY
i=1KX
j=1wifj(vi)
where C={Cj}K
j=1is the set of clusters,
where each cluster has a Gaussian density
function fjand a prior distribution wj. Clas-
sically, we find the maximum likelihood esti-
mation using the Expectation-Maximization
(EM) approach.
6 Models
6.1 Method
The final model fills in the remaining slots of the
model pipeline by using:
•Word Embedding : We obtain the contextu-
alized static representations of each word us-
ing pre-trained BERT (Kenton and Toutanova,
2019) embeddings and averaging the repre-
sentations of all occurrences of the word
(Wang et al., 2021). We used the pre-trained
bert-base-uncased model with its de-
fault vector dimension 768.
•Representations : Since cosine similarity will
perform poorly on a high-dimensional vector,
we use PCA to reduce all class and document
embeddings.
•Label Generation : Instead of directly using
statistical methods, we use ChatGPT API – a
chatbot fine-tuned using reinforcement learn-
ing on OpenAI’s state-of-the-art language
model GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) that has
shown the ability for text generation and sum-
marization. We prompt ChatGPT to: (1) Gen-
erate topics for the top 25 documents in Gaus-
Figure 2: Maximum Similarity Distribution for Unla-
beled Documents
sian probability per cluster; (2) Use the sum-
marized topics to generate a generic class la-
bel.
6.2 Results and Discussion
We report the results of the final model, by the same
order as the pipeline shows.
Seed Words: We present a few example seed
words generated from the first supervised TF-IDF
module below. The basic TF-IDF scores are able
to identify relatively representative seed words.
• Album: studio, band, songs, ...
•Company: founded, headquartered, services,
...
• Film: directed, starring, drama, ...
Similarity Distribution: Figure 2 shows the dis-
tribution of the maximum cosine similarity found
for all unlabeled documents, and thus provides
us with the criteria to get unconfident documents.
From the figure, the distribution is roughly normal
with a slight right skew, and the value ranges from
-0.2 to almost 1.0. This is the ideal distribution,
since by the definition of cosine similarity, there
will be similarities at 0, indicating the representa-
tions are not related; there will also be negative
similarities, indicating the representations mean
something opposite.
Unconfident Documents: Figure 3 shows the
2D unconfident document representations after ap-
plying the t-SNE (van der Maaten and Hinton,
2008) dimensionality reduction technique to vi-
sualize the high-dimensional data, color-coded by
their original label, with ""Other"" indicating any ex-
isting labels. To generate the 2D representation,
we followed the suggestions on sklearn t-SNETable 2: Final model experiment results: BERT Embeddings

beled Documents
to first use Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
to reduce to 50 dimensions and apply t-SNE with
perplexity 30. From the figure, the unconfident
documents follow pretty closely with the original
removed labels, and 4 new class distributions are
distinctive to be clustered: Transportation, Politics,
School, Building. From this distribution, we could
expect the Gaussian Mixture method to detect most
of the new classes relatively well, with the excep-
tion that the ""Transportation"" class (in orange) has
two clear centers, which might not be well detected
by the model. There will also be a few noisy doc-
uments lying around (0,0)in t-SNE that confuses
clustering and label generation.
Experiment Results: Table 2 shows the results
of experimenting with different threshold cutoffs
(0.05, 0.1, 0.15) and 2 PCA dimensions (128, 256).
From the existing labels prediction, we could see
that the supervised + weakly supervised models
perform relatively well on classes already known
in the dataset, and have improved from the base-
line Word2Vec representations. Also, compared
to ConWea replication where seed words are all
human-chosen, the ability of the model to learn theseed words from the existing labeled documents is
helping the understanding of existing classes. Note
that sometimes in the ConWea setting, we might
not have enough labeled documents to generate the
seed words, so human efforts are still useful.
The new label binary classification shows satis-
factory results, as in all the experiment settings we
observe a precision close to or over 0.9, showing
that the similarity cutoff is picking mostly correct
out-of-distribution documents. On the other hand,
the recall is less optimal, but it increases drasti-
cally if we take more documents. This indicates
that most out-of-distribution documents lie in the
region with positive, non-lowest similarities. It’s
also possible for documents in the same class to
have opposite meanings, which makes the simple
split less practical.
However, the existing label performance show
stable and robust results, confirming the ability of
BERT embeddings to find existing classes. One
drawback is that the DBPedia dataset is well-
balanced, so micro- and macro-F1 will co-change
with a similar trend; when in real-world scenarios
when less popular classes are more likely to be
unseen, it’s unclear how the model will perform.
Finally, we present the labels generated from
ChatGPT, compared with the removed labels:
•Generated Labels: ’School’, ’Navy’, ’Biogra-
phy’, ’Institutions’, ’Specialized’
•Removed Labels: ’Artist’, ’Building’, ’Poli-
tics’, ’School’, ’Transportation’
The word cloud of each removed class and clus-
tered class is plotted in Figure 4. From the label
comparison and the word cloud, most important
words show in aligned clusters, confirming that the
clusters found are relatively close to the original
classes. It also lays a good foundation for labelFigure 4: Word cloud for removed (left column) and
generated (right column) labels, with manual row align-
ment. Note they don’t necessarily match.
generation. In addition, ChatGPT also produces
reasonable generic labels for the clusters.
6.3 Baseline Model
As a comparison, we present the settings for the
baseline model, which fills in the remaining slots
of the model pipeline by using:
•Word Embedding : We train a Word2Vec
(Mikolov et al., 2013) model to learn word
embedding vectors for each word
•Label Generation : We take the clusters ob-
tained in the Gaussian Mixture model, and
pick the unique word with the best TF-IDF
score for each class for the generated class
label.
For the baseline model, we obtain the best results
from the following experiment setting:
•Preprocessing: Remove punctuation and
standard English stopwords;
•Word2Vec: Vector Dimension 128, Window
10, Epochs 150;
•Confidence Split : Threshold 0.3The setting gives the following results:
•New Label Binary: Precision 0.782, Recall
0.656.
•Existing Performance: Micro-F1 0.856,
Macro-F1 0.849.
•Example Generated Labels: ""politi-
cian"",""aircraft"",""historic"",""village"",""navy""
7 Related Work
Research has been conducted to tackle weakly su-
pervised settings to reduce human workload:
Meng et al., 2018; Mekala and Shang, 2020 uti-
lize a few user-provided seed words for the only
annotation; Mekala et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022
utilize metadata information about the articles such
as authors and publication dates which require less
human effort to obtain; more advanced methods
such as Meng et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021; Zeng
et al., 2022; Shen et al., 2021 only require class
label names. All of the models leverage the lim-
ited information provided by humans with learned
representations including knowledge graphs, large
pre-trained language models, etc. to achieve sat-
isfactory classification accuracy. Almost none of
the previous research has mentioned this setting,
including papers we have covered in Quarter 1, but
similar methods could be tweaked in minor ways
and applied to this new setting.
There were also attempts to detect out-of-
distribution data points and perform open-world
classification:
Shu et al., 2017 utilized the 1-vs-Rest layer as
the last layer in inference-time model to avoid us-
ing softmax to normalize the probabilities and find
documents that are out of the existing distribution.
Shu et al., 2018 leverages pair-wise classification
network in seen and unseen documents for unseen
class detection, and utilizes hierarchical clustering
to find new clusters of classes. Zhang et al., 2020;
Shu et al., 2021 leverages the labeled documents
to learn adaptive boundaries for each existing class
and used the boundaries to classify unseen docu-
ments as part of unseen classes. Most methods
above focus on the single rejection class, and none
help generate new class labels.
Finally, Grootendorst, 2022 uses pre-trained
BERT (Kenton and Toutanova, 2019) embeddings
on an entirely unsupervised dataset, performs
UMAP (McInnes et al., 2018) dimensionality re-
duction, leverages HDBSCAN (Campello et al.,2013) clustering technique to find patterns from
the documents, and used class-based TF-IDF for
label generation. This work is closely related to
part of our setting, but focuses on the entirely un-
supervised setting, which could find good general
topics but might perform less ideally when users
have a customized set of classes.
8 Future Work
From the discussions above, although the current
final model is capable of finding quality representa-
tions, performing reasonable similarity-based con-
fidence splits, and generating labels based on clus-
ters, there are plenty of drawbacks that this model
failed to address:
•Confidence Split : In some literature (Shu
et al., 2017), the split threshold is automati-
cally learned from each existing class, which
requires less manual instructions and could
lead to potential better splits targeted at indi-
vidual classes;
•Clustering : In the current model, we have
to specify the number of clusters beforehand,
which requires prior assumptions. We can
replace Gaussian Mixture with density-based
clustering or LDA to automatically detect the
potential number of new classes. Hierarchical
clustering can also be applied so that examples
of multiple centers can be included as well.
•Data : The DBPedia dataset is well-balanced,
which is less realistic for unseen classes. In
the example of the online database, classes
that failed to be provided beforehand are more
likely to be unpopular classes. We need to
improve method heuristics to work for unbal-
anced and fine-label datasets.
•Extension : Since the model has the ability to
detect new labels based on out-of-distribution
documents, we can naturally extend the model
to detect potential mislabels. For example,
we can utilize confidence scores to identify
and relabel poor human annotations and allow
multi-labels.
•Extension : As discussed in the Method sec-
tion, we choose simple similarity-based tech-
niques to have the opportunity to further de-
crease human effort, which is both error-proneand time-consuming. We can fully utilize ex-
tremely weak supervision techniques to only
use class names as supervision and learn class-
oriented document representations using atten-
tion (Wang et al., 2021).
9 Conclusion
In conclusion, the setting of incomplete text clas-
sification can leverage classical ML and weakly
supervised methods to predict documents to exist-
ing labels; by using a few additional steps on the
confident documents, new classes could be pro-
duced as well. In particular, the new label binary
task, existing label performance, and new label per-
formance all showed relatively, if not better, results.
However, there is also much room for improve-
ment to make the model more robust and target
more realistic yet less ideal situations.

A b s t r a c t
Natural language processing (NLP) is a
rapidly developing field with recent
applications including weakly supervised
text classification that uses machine
learning techniques to label documents
with minimal human intervention.
As the opposite of conventional
dictionaries of key-value pairs, reverse
dictionaries return the key when given a
value. Reverse dictionaries can be
augmented using NLP models.
Video game franchises can have over a
thousand characters, each with distinct
characteristics. For returning fans, one
may run into a tip-of-the-tongue situation
in which they may recall certain facts but
be unable to name a character. We
provide a reverse dictionary tool for
people to query such facts and receive
the name of the character they were
describing.
The code repository can be found at
https://github.com/k6chan/reverse-dictio
nary-pokemon
.
I n t r o d u c t i o n
Rather than the conventional dictionary
structure that returns a value when given a
key, reverse dictionaries return a key given
the value. These have helpful applications
for classification when there are many
possible classes. Example applications
include identifying body parts and medical
conditions based on symptoms (Table 1). In
this paper we apply a reverse dictionary to a
video game franchise. Collectible monster
series like
Pokémon
can have hundreds of
characters, each with distinct
characteristics, making a reverse dictionary
a helpful way to query specific Pokémon
based on their appearance and statistics
from the games.

Frostbite
Table 1: An example of a reverse
dictionary’s input and output.
Reverse dictionaries are simple to
implement if the value exactly matches or
contains the dictionary definition, but in
reality a user may not provide such a
perfect match. Natural language processing
(NLP) allows for a more realistic model to
be implemented where the user’s
description can be used to search for the
top most likely names. A baseline method
that does not require human supervision is
Term-Frequency-Inverse-Document
Frequency when used for information
retrieval (IR-TF-IDF). When adapted for text
classification, IR-TD-IDF aggregates the
TF-IDF values of its seed words–in this
context, the user’s query–as they appear in
a given document and assigns a label
based on the class with the greatest
aggregate TF-IDF. Each document
corresponds to a Pokémon.
Similar to a search engine, this reverse
dictionary will provide the names of the top
Pokémon with the most similarity to a
user-provided query. It is available as a web
app that can be hosted locally on user’s
computers through source code or
environment on GitHub and Docker.Pokémon data from the reverse dictionary is
web scraped from the Smogon University
and Bulbapedia fan wikis and aggregated
into descriptions for each Pokémon that will
be matched against the user-provided
query.
M e t h o d s
The
Pokémon
franchise is well-documented
online on fan-maintained wikis. Data is first
scraped from Smogon University for a “dex”
identifier, numerical stats, types, abilities,
competitive ranking, and immediate
evolution for each Pokémon up to
Generation 7 (2017) (Table 2). Exact
numbers are unlikely to be recalled by
users, so thresholds are set to determine if
a Pokémon is “fast” or “heavy”.
Table 2: Web-scraped stats, competitive
ranking, and abilities of Pokémon from
Smogon.
Biological descriptions must be collected
from another source: Bulbapedia is then
scraped for a list of all Pokémon by dex
number, which can allow merging onto the
Smogon dataset to aggregate Pokémon
data into a single table (Table 3).
Table 3: Web-scraped page links for each
Pokémon and their dex number from
Bulbapedia.
The list of page links for each Pokémon is
used to access that Pokémon’s wiki page
on Bulbapedia, from where information
including biological descriptions of the
Pokémon can be scraped and extracted for
nouns using the spaCy natural language
processing library. These nouns are
recorded and appended to the Smogon
data.
Both the collected data and the user’s query
is lemmatized and removed of stopwords.
When sufficient data is compiled, all
descriptors of a Pokémon are concatenated
into a single paragraph with which TF-IDF
can be calculated from a user-provided
query. The top 5 matching Pokémon are
sorted and displayed in the web app based
on the cosine similarity to the query’s
TF-IDF vector. This baseline method does
not take sentence structure into account.
Word2Vec creates word vector
representations of all the words in a corpus,
creates label representations by
aggregating the vectors of seed words only,
then assigns all other documents a label
based on the largest cosine similarity
between the chosen document’s vector with
each label’s vector (Shang). Doc2Vec is a
similar tool that creates vector
representations of entire documents rather
than by the words.
The next model available is an extension of
IR-TF-IDF that uses words similar to the
user’s query as suggested by a Word2Vec
model pre-trained on a Wikipedia dataset.
1
The Word2Vec model supplies the top 10
most similar words to each word in the
user’s query. All similar words and the
user’s query itself is then fed into the
baseline IR-TF-IDF model.
The GPT-3 Davinci API was implemented
into the web app, using the user’s query to
ask the neural network for the top 5
Pokémon that match the query. GPT-3 uses
its own collection of data sources, including
Wikipedia and Common Crawl, essentially
an archived version of the Web (Brown et
al. 3-4). It is able to parse the query at a
high level and use it to search the specific
domain of Pokémon and return a sensible
result. As the GPT-3 API requires credit to
be used pass a trial period, it is not
available on the web app.
R e s u l t s
As IR-TF-IDF relies on counting and
matching the exact words from the user’s
query to each document, it will fail to return
any similar Pokémon when the user’s query
does not contain words found in any
document (Table 4).

Petilil
Basculin - Blue
Basculin
Sandile
Table 4: The default top 5 results provided
by IR-TF-IDF on the web app when no
terms from the user’s query match any
documents.
A standalone Word2Vec model that
returned the top most similar Pokémon
vector representations compared via cosine
similarity to the user’s query as a vector did
not return Pokémon that even visually
matched the query, likely due to the narrow
domain and insufficient collected data for a
model to be trained on or transform. Using
the pre-trained model did not show a
noticeable improvement to this observation.
Instead, the pre-trained model was used to
provide additional words similar to the
user’s query that are also fed into the
IR-TF-IDF model, reducing the amount of
times the default IR-TF-IDF result appears
from Table 4. This addition of Word2Vec
does help in situations where a very similar
word to the user’s query is in the collected
data, but there are also situations where the
suggestions provided by Word2Vec are
unrelated to the user’s query given the
narrow domain; for example, Word2Vec
suggests music-themed words when given
the word “rock”, despite the word’s use in
Pokémon usually relating to the natural
object. And if the user provides a word not
in the trained model’s vocabulary–which can
be common since there are characters and
terminology that are not common English
words–the model is unable to infer its vector
and throws an error.
GPT-3 showed impressive and reasonable
results after fine-tuning the question the
web app asks the neural network. The most
complex GPT-3 model, Davinci, can
“name
the top 5 actual Pokémon up to Generation
7 that match the query”
provided by the user
on the web app. The word “actual” has to be
included in the question to avoid
nonexistent Pokémon being suggested, and
“up to Generation 7” prevents Pokémon
from further generations being returned. A
comparison between the baseline
IR-TF-IDF, IR-TF-IDF with Word2Vec, and
GPT-3 models is provided (Table 5). When
given a query whose words do not exist in
the collected data (“octopus”), IR-TF-IDF
provides the default result, IR-TF-IDF with
Word2Vec does not return an octopus
Pokémon but instead includes a squid and
starfish Pokémon, and GPT-3 with its
outside data sources is finally able to return
an octopus Pokémon.
Table 5: Top 5 results from three models
(IR-TF-IDF, IR-TF-IDF with similar words
suggested by Word2Vec, and GPT-3) when
given the query “octopus”, which is a word
not in the collected data.
An extension to the project investigating
Pokémon as vectors with the collected data
used Doc2Vec to convert each Pokémon’s
document into a vector. Due to the same
reasons behind Word2Vec’s inaccuracy,
Pokémon that look visually similar or have
similar theming do not always have the
most similar vectors (Figure 1). For
example, the golem Pokémon Regice has a
closer similarity to the airplane-like Latios
over another golem, Regirock.

correlation coefficient between 5 Pokémon
represented as vectors. A coefficient closer
to 1 means a higher linear correlation
between the vectors. Red outlines describe
a comparatively low correlation despite
being biologically similar to the other
Pokémon.
C o n c l u s i o n
A reverse dictionary for a particular domain
such as a video game series is an engaging
method for people to reconnect with a
series they enjoy. It is useful for solving
tip-of-the-tongue problems where only a few
descriptors of a character are known, as it
can return numerous possible matches
sorted by confidence.
The data collected is sufficient for baseline
models and some neural networks to
provide accurate results, however the latter
requires more robust descriptions of each
character from a variety of sources in order
to cover as much of the narrow domain as
possible. Extensions to this paper include
additional models on the web app, more
data collection from Bulbapedia such as
behavior and role in the story or games.
GPT-3 can be asked to provide additional
descriptors on each Pokémon. Other NLP
models will also benefit from sentence
structure being considered and contained
within the data. Inspiration for other models
can be found on Hugging Face’s
question-answer, sentence similarity, or
transformer repositories, and other research
papers on reverse dictionaries like

1 Abstract
We are interested in identifying spam emails and messages in general given a set of seed words and
classes in the weakly supervised text classification setting. We are mostly interested in this because
of the emergence of spam messages that continue to improve and bypass current spam filter detection
systems. Furthermore, we want to be able to classify what kind of spam messages are coming in
to get an idea of the pattern of each type of spam message. We are hoping detecting patterns could
leave to money saving and seeing how these messages evolve can provide some insight into how to
do so. Phishing and other forms of scams cost United States citizens billions of dollars a year as
companies try to keep up against these attacks. The Federal Trade Commission recently published
that consumers lost nearly 8.8 billion dollars to scams in 2022 ( 2). So, we want to be able to help
non-tech-savvy people by limiting their interactions with these potentially harmful messages.
2 Introduction
2.1 Narrow Problem Statement and Methods
Previous works have attempted to implement effective spam filtering tools and some are successfully
being used in E-mail services such as Gmail. These filters are good at finding most spam emails,
but they don’t tell the user what specific spam they are receiving, so we are interested in providing
this information to the users by further classifying the types of spam that a particular user receives,
hoping to facilitate users to realize what a typical message of a certain type of spam can look like.
The investigation into spam email filtering is closely related to the technology being introduced in
Quarter 1. We will utilize the NLP machine learning framework learned in Quarter 1, ConWea, to
implement this NLP application( 1). Moreover, we will reproduce the models TF-IDF and Word2Vec
implemented in the Quarter 1 project as our baseline models for the Quarter 2 project. After doing so,
we will look at improving these models with better word embeddings using FastText. Next, we will
be using large, more complex language models such as ConWea, BERT, and potentially more to see
if these large language models improve upon those baselines - showing if they are worth using or
not. We are hopeful that ConWea, with the provided contextualization of words, will lead to a better
classifier.
Preprint. Under review.Furthermore, the setting of weakly supervised text classification will alleviate the human burden of
annotation future massive datasets filled with spam messages. The trends found from a subset of
documents that were labeled should be representative of future documents the classifier may see.
2.2 Deliverable
Our group aims to deliver a report, discussing these details further and diving deeper into a discussion
about these models and their performance. The report will also include a model deployment section
that gives a user guide to use the spam filter tool with special consideration on the potential data
ethics issue. We would also like to put out a website as a platform for model deployment, after model
training, that would allow a user to input a message and receive feedback into the message - such as if
it was spam or not and if it is spam; what kind of spam it is. Our interactive website with instructions
on how to set it up can be found here. We do not host the interactive website 24/7 due to hosting
costs.
3 Dataset
To do so, we will be leveraging the most reliable data set in terms of email messaging known as
Enron. This data set contains 6 different datasets, each has around 6000 emails, and 1/4 of them are
spams1. We had to annotate all instances of spam and classify them in a certain way to fine-grain the
data into more detail about which spam it is. The leveraging of our own time was heavily devoted
to the annotation process, but still human errors are bound to exist within the annotations. We will
do all of this by considering models that range from baseline models to complex language models.
Only one of these data sets was annotated fully to use in training, while the others are used primarily
for testing our models prediction accuracy on completely unseen messaging patterns. The topics
extracted from the spam messages were split up and annotated into following categories;
1. Medical Sales
2. Investment
3. Phishing
4. Sexual
5. Insurance
6. Software
7. Other
The Enron data set provides an already preprocessed version of the text into their text files, but due to
the nature of spam emails a lot more preprocessing techniques must be put into place to extract the
actual information from messages. More specifically, people are trying to bypass current detection
systems by adding filler words that have nothing to do with the message, changing out letters for
numbers like I for ! or L, and patterns similar to that. By using strong preprocessing techniques such
as lemmatizing and stemming words, we are able to extract the true meaning behind each message
and further classify them into the categories listed before.
4 Seed Words
Through our model of weakly supervised text classification, we will use a variety of seed words that
correspond to each label of spam.
Mathematically, we are given a set of nmessages M={M1, M2, ..., M n}, a set of ilabels
L={L1, L2, ..., L i}and finally we are constructing a set of jseed words S={S1, S2, ..., S j}.
To construct the set S, we look at the manually annotated set of messages from the data and find
common words. Of course to not overfit to this dataset only, we also made sure the seed words
generated all made sense in an overall picture of this label. An example of this is for the medical
sales label, a consesus was agreed upon by both us as humans and what the data told us through
common words that seed words like drug, pain, pill would work well.
1https://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/
2The current seed words are being used. However, they may be changed in future versions as
preprocessing techniques develop and change. Note: Other does not have seed words as it means the
spam could not be classified further into our categories.

Table 1: Seed Words
5 Models
5.1 IR-TF-IDF
Prior to fitting the models, we changed all sentences to be lower-cased. Removed punctuation,
trailing white spaces and stop words using NLTK.
We started with baseline models to get an idea of how well they will perform in relation to some of
the more complex models. First, we leveraged a classical method known as IR-TF-IDF - which put
simply refers to counting up the number of seed words in each class and picking the class that has the
highest occurrence in the message.
•TF-IDF calculation: For each seedword, calculate its TF-IDF value with respect to a specific
document using the following formula;
tfid f (t, d) =tf(t, d)∗id f(t)
Where
tf(t, d) =# of times tappears in d
and
id f(t) =log(#documents
#documents where t appears).
For each document, sum up all TF-IDF values for all seedwords within a label, and assign
the document with the label that has the highest TF-IDF sum.
•Micro/Macro F1 calculation: Use sklearn.metrics.f1 _score to derive Micro and Macro F1
scores, respectively.
5.2 Word2Vec
As our next baseline model, we implemented another classical technique Word2Vec.
•Word2Vec Model Training: Initialize a Word2Vec vector from gensim and specify size =
110, window = 5, min_count = 1. Use 4 workers and train for 800 epochs.
•Cosine similarity calculation: For each seedword, fetch the corresponding vector from
Word2Vec model. Take the average of all vectors within a label and use that as the final
word vector. For a single document, simply take the average of all word vectors within
that document. Compute the cosine similarity between a document and a label using the
following formula
cos(doc, label ) =doc·label
∥doc∥∥label∥
Where doc represents the word vector for a document, and label represents the word vector
for a label. Assign the document with the label that has the highest cosine similarity.
•Micro/Macro F1 calculation: Use sklearn.metrics.f1 _score to derive Micro and Macro F1
scores, respectively.
5.3 FastText
We used the word vector representations trained by unsupervised FastText for prediction. FastText
(3), created by Facebook AI, is a lightweight tool that takes in to account the structure of the words -
producing better and more efficient word embeddings compared to Word2Vec. We then use these
word embeddings in the same way as we did above for Word2Vec.
3Model Micro-F1 Macro-F1
IR-TF-IDF 0.69 0.67
Word2Vec 0.70 0.72
FastText 0.71 0.72
ConWea 0.75 0.75
Table 2: Prediction results.
•FastText Model Training: Initialize a FastText model and specify lr=0.05, wordNgrams=5,
loss=’hs’, dim=50. Train for 600 epochs.
•Cosine similarity calculation: The calculation and prediction procedure is similar to that of
Word2Vec, the only difference is that we use different word embeddings.
•Micro/Macro F1 calculation: Use sklearn.metrics.f1 _score to derive Micro and Macro F1
scores, respectively.
5.4 ConWea
Our final model is ConWea, which is a weakly supervised classification model that automatically
assigns labels to the training data, which was developed by our mentor Jingbo Shang. As we know
with human language, context is a huge factor in how a word should be portrayed. ConWea looks to
solve this problem by providing contextualized weak supervision for text classification. ConWea uses
BERT vectors along with a Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) classifier to make predictions.
•ConWea Model Contextualization: Encode both the word occurrences and the user provided
seed words to create a contextualized corpus using BERT vectors (Mekala &Shang, ACL
2020). This means different meanings of the same word can be used for different labels.
•ConWea Model training: Unlike traditional text classification methods, ConWea is not fed
with labels during training. Instead, it generates its own labels with the contextualized
documents and train a HAN classifier with the labels to proceed with text classification
(Mekala &Shang, ACL 2020).
•Micro/Macro F1 calculation: In the training stage, ConWea runs for 6 iterations and outputs
the Micro/Macro F1 scores for each iteration. Each iteration contains a model with different
input layers. The model with the best performance has 4 layers and we recorded its
Micro/Macro F1 scores correspondingly.
For more extended details about the ConWea model, refer to the paper mentioned. (1)
6 Results
Prediction results are shown in Table 1. The overall performance of these models are similar (around
0.7) but do increase as we use bigger models. We expect both micro and macro F1 scores to be
higher if we apply more large and complex models such as BERT and ConWea. It now falls on the
company or user to decide if the increase of F1 scores is worth the computational costs of running
larger models.
7 Conclusion
As we can see from the results, as we increase our model’s complexity we are achieving a better
accuracy even on unseen data. Experiments showed that combining Word2Vec with better word
embeddings through FastText provided the best results so far. We expect in the future as our data
preprocesing techniques improve along with more advanced models that we will produce better results
further down the road. It comes down to whether or not a company thinks that approximately 3 percent
better accuracy across classes matters, and for big companies that use Spam Filters like Google we’d
assume they would probably invest in these bigger models for the sake of their consumers. For other
simple scenarios, we believe that just using FastText word embeddings provide enough accuracy
at little computational cost. Some limitations we faced included; the dataset. The Enron dataset is
one of very few public email datasets available, and the data included in the Enron dataset follows a
certain pattern since these messages were only collected from a certain period of time. Thus, our
models pick up on these patterns and produce results based on this. Moreso, with no dataset having
4labels of what time of spam it is we had to humanly annotate 4500 documents and use only those as
our training data. Human annotation error is present in this dataset, but is kept as minimal as possible.
However, in real world scenarios spam is endlessly evolving and trying to get around these filters
so we can expect some messages to be misclassified, especially if a user inputted message is much
different than what the model has seen with the data. Most of our limitations is due to what data is
available for this type of work. We assume that in practice, places like Google with G-mail, have
access to a lot more data that they can train on and explore newer layouts of spam. In conclusion, we
are satisfied that we were able to given just a set of labels with a small subset of words that represent
each later, we are able to classify most documents as a label with a balanced accuracy of about 75
percent.

Abstract
Application
launch
time
is
a
crucial
element
of
the
user 
experience.
Long
wait
times
can
cause
frustration
and
prompt 
users
to
upgrade
to
more
powerful
machines,
resulting
in
increased 
electronic
waste
(e-waste)
at
landfills.
Improving
app
launch
time 
is
vital
in
reducing
e-waste
by
extending
the
average
lifespan
of 
computers.
While
software
has
become
more
resource
efficient,
it 
is
still
challenging
to
prevent
large
programs
from
being
bloated 
and
slow
to
run.
In
this
paper,
we
propose
utilizing
neural 
networks
to
analyze
system
usage
reports
and
pre-launch 
applications
in
the
background
before
the
user
needs
them.
This 
approach
can
be
universally
applied
to
all
computers,
making
it 
more
economically
viable
than
asking
all
developers
to
optimize 
their
applications.
We
developed
our
data
collection
software
to 
minimize
resource
usage
and
to
identify
applications
that
the 
system
can
pre-launch
using
Hidden
Markov
Model
(HMM)
and 
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.
1    Introduction
The
Windows
operating
system
is
built
to
be
compatible
with
a
diverse
range
of
hardware 
specifications.
A
study
conducted
by
Intel
revealed
that
many
machines,
including
brand
new 
laptops
performed
unexpectedly
poor
on
application
launch
times.
For
instance,
a
brand
new 
computer
takes
an
average
of
11
seconds
to
launch
Google
Chrome.
Our
speculation
is
that
the 
study
was
conducted
globally
and
many
new
laptops
are
still
being
shipped
with
slower
hardware. 
In
addition,
developers
have
no
incentive
to
improve
performance
as
most
companies
strive
to 
move
fast
and
break
things
than
to
release
the
perfect
application.
This
leads
to
longer
app
launch 
times
on
older
or
slower
computers,
which
harms
the
overall
user
experience
and
hampers 
productivity.
Our
objective
is
to
make
devices
feel
more
responsive
through
a
data-driven 
solution.
Long
app
launch
time
could
be
attributed
to
a
variety
of
factors
such
as
the
performance
of
the 
architecture
the
application
is
built
on,
the
processing
speed
of
the
hardware,
and
poor
coding 
practices
that
results
in
unoptimized
code.
Our
solution
to
this
issue
is
to
pre-emptively
launch 
applications
before
the
user
needs
them.
To
achieve
this
goal,
we
created
a
software
that
collects 
system
usage
data.
Two
deep
learning
models
are
used
to
analyze
user
habits
and
trends,
the 
Hidden
Markov
Model
(HMM)
and
Long
Short-Term
Memory
(LSTM)
model.
Hidden
Markov 
Model
is
used
to
predict
the
sequence
of
applications
to
be
used
by
the
user
and
Long
Short-Term 
Memory
model
will
be
used
to
predict
application
usage.
The
application
with
the
highest 
predicted
usage
and
frequency
will
be
marked
as
candidates
suitable
for
pre-launching.
Our 
implementation and results are detailed below.2
Methods
2.1    Data Collection
To
ensure
that
other
people
can
replicate
the
methods
discussed
in
our
method,
we
created
our 
own
software
to
collect
the
system
usage
data.
This
way,
we
can
be
as
granular
as
we
want
in
the 
collection
process
to
capture
more
data
or
be
more
coarse
to
reduce
file
size.
We
build
this
data 
collector
with
the
help
of
Intel’s
X
Library
Software
Development
Kit
(XLSDK).
The
XLSDK 
package
the
data
generated
from
our
code
and
stores
it
in
a
database.
To
predict
the
sequences
of 
applications
used
on
a
given
day
and
their
respective
timeframe,
we
wrote
code
to
capture
the 
foreground window. The collection process is activated on two conditions.
The
first
condition
is
triggered
when
a
user
clicks
on
the
screen.
We
accomplish
this
by
creating
a 
pure-event
driven
thread
that
monitors
for
mouse
clicks.
When
we
detect
a
mouse
click,
the 
software
locks
the
mouse
for
a
tenth
of
a
millisecond
by
acquiring
the
keys
to
the
critical
section. 
It
then
captures
the
x
and
y
coordinate
of
the
mouse
click
and
retrieves
the
handle
to
the 
application
positioned
at
that
coordinate
through
the
use
of
Win32API.
Sometimes,
the
foreground 
window
changes
without
a
mouse
click
such
as
alt-tabbing
between
windows.
To
address
this 
concern,
we
have
a
second
thread
that
is
triggered
at
a
set
interval
(i.e.
every
10
seconds)
to
check 
if
the
current
foreground
window
is
the
same.
If
the
current
window
has
a
different
process
ID 
than the previous window, then we log the application into our database.
Fig 1. Data Result Sample
After
logging
the
essential
information
regarding
the
new
foreground
window,
we
send
a
signal
to 
the
desktop
mapper
input
library
to
capture
a
snapshot
of
all
the
visible
windows.
This
can
help
us 
remember
the
location
of
each
window
and
launch
the
application
in
the
right
position
and
size.
To 
see an example of the raw data we have collected, see
Fig 1
.
2.1.1   Data Collection Principles
Once
we
have
developed
the
minimal
viable
product
to
collect
the
data,
we
made
modifications
to 
the
program
so
that
it
can
be
deployed
on
a
wide
range
of
devices.
We
accomplish
this
goal
by 
adhering to the following principles.
1.
Robustness and Resilience
To
ensure
that
our
program
continues
to
run
without
requiring
human
intervention
in
the
event
of
errors
during
deployment,
we
have
implemented
defensive
coding
practices.
We
have
verified
the
data
type
and
range
of
variables
before
feeding
them
into
functions.
If
an
error
occurs,
we
log
the
error
type,
the
file
that
generated
the
error,
the
line
number
within
the
file,
and
the
timestamp.
This
enables
us
to
identify
faulty
code
while
reviewing
error
logs.
Through
this
approach
and
rigorous
testing,
we
were
able to keep our collector running without errors for eight weeks.
2.
Privacy Compliance
To
obtain
the
name
of
the
foreground
window
application,
we
must
locate
the
application’s
file
path,
which
may
contain
Personal
Identifiable
Information
(PII)
such
as
a
person’s
full
legal
name.
To
prevent
the
collection
of
PII,
we
have
implemented
a
process
to
remove
any
PII
from
the
file
path
before
storing
the
collected
information.
For
example,
if
a
user
has
named
their
system
after
their
legal
name,
we
exclude
the
full file path to prevent the collection of PII.
3.
Efficiency
We
have
optimized
the
code
to
reduce
the
impact
on
system
resources,
such
as
CPU
and
memory
usage,
by
minimizing
unnecessary
processing
and
data
transfer.
This
is
crucial
as
we
want
the
application
to
run
continuously
in
the
background
while
the
computer
is
on.
To
achieve
this,
we
only
allocate
the
minimum
necessary
memory
to
arrays and expand them as needed, ensuring efficient use of system resources.
4.
Compatibility
We
have
designed
the
data
collector
to
be
compatible
with
a
wide
range
of
languages
by
changing
our
collected
strings
from
ANSI
to
UNICODE
to
capture
foreign
characters.
This
enables
us
to
accurately
capture
and
store
data
in
different
languages,
ensuring compatibility with various software applications and operating systems.
2.1.2   Automation
To
ensure
the
quality
of
our
training
dataset,
we
aim
to
collect
continuous
data
whenever
possible. 
To
achieve
this,
we
have
created
a
task
in
the
Windows
10
task
scheduler
to
automatically
run
our 
data
collection
software
whenever
a
user
logs
into
their
computer.
The
software
is
designed
to
run 
in
the
background
to
minimize
any
potential
disruptions
to
the
user's
workflow.
Additionally,
this 
approach
prevents
accidental
closure
of
the
program,
which
would
lead
to
incomplete
data.
As
a 
result
of
our
diligent
approach
over
the
first
ten
weeks
of
this
study,
we
have
successfully 
collected eight weeks of usage data.
2.2    Exploratory Data Analysis
We
have
collected
over
8
weeks
of
data
and
Fig
2
EDA
result
shows
the
top
10
processes
and 
their corresponding total duration the user used.
Fig 2. Top 10 Apps by Usage (measured in hours)
To
create
an
effective
Long
Short-Term
Memory
(LSTM)
model,
we
limited
our
case
study
to
analyzing
the
usage
of
the
most
frequently
used
app.
League
of
Legends
and
FireFox
were 
considered
as
the
top
contenders.
However,
we
selected
FireFox
as
our
subject
of
study
as
it 
demonstrates
more
consistency
in
usage
over
time
compared
to
League
of
Legends
(
Fig
3
&
Fig 
4
),
which
experiences
a
spike
in
usage
during
winter
break
but
a
sharp
decline
after
the
academic 
quarter
begins.
The
time
series
chart
of
FireFox
usage
shows
stable
amplitude,
which
makes
it
an 
ideal
candidate
for
the
LSTM
model.
Our
objective
is
for
the
model
to
understand
these
usage 
patterns and make accurate predictions, so we decided to focus on FireFox for our second task.

Fig 4. Usage over time for FireFox
2.3    Tasks, Models, and Evaluation Metrics
We
tackled
two
forecasting
objectives
using
the
data
we
gathered
over
several
weeks.
Our
first 
objective
is
to
predict
the
subsequent
application
an
individual
will
use,
based
on
their
past
usage 
patterns.
Then,
our
second
task,
which
is
also
our
primary
objective,
is
to
forecast
the
amount
of 
time (in seconds) an individual will spend on a specific application within a specific hour.
2.3.1    Task 1: Next-App Prediction with Hidden Markov Model
In
task
one,
our
goal
is
to
predict
the
next
application
the
user
will
use
based
on
the
previous 
usage
data.
Hidden
Markov
Models
(HMMs)
are
a
type
of
machine
learning
predictive
model 
used
for
modeling
sequential
data.
In
an
HMM,
the
underlying
system
is
assumed
to
be
a
Markov 
process,
which
means
that
the
probability
of
the
system
being
in
a
certain
state
at
time
t
depends 
only
on
the
state
of
the
system
at
time
t-1.
In
our
scenario,
we
just
need
to
tally
up
the
number
of 
times
an
application
(e.g.,
Zoom)
is
used
after
Google
Chrome
has
been
used.
This
can
help
us 
generate
a
list
of
applications
that
are
commonly
used
following
the
use
of
a
specific
application. 
Therefore,
we
can
create
a
transition
matrix,
which
is
the
probability
of
moving
from
one
state
to 
another
for
every
application
in
the
dataset.
They
specify
the
probability
that
the
underlying 
system
will
transition
from
one
state
to
another
in
the
next
time
step.
Just
like
in
Fig
5
,
the
number 
between
the
apps
is
the
probability
of
one
app
to
another
and
these
are
calculated
with
previous 
activity.
Fig 5.
Simple Illustration of HMM
To assess the performance of our HMM Model, we used 20% of our dataset as a testing dataset. 
We evaluated our model's accuracy by checking if the ground truth falls within the top N 
predictions generated by the model. In other words, if the correct answer is among the top n 
guesses, the model gets credit for predicting correctly.
2.3.2    Task 2: App Duration Prediction with Long Short-Term Memory
We
focused
on
using
FireFox
as
the
primary
application
for
predicting
the
duration
of
usage 
during
a
specific
hour.
LSTM
(Long
Short-Term
Memory)
is
a
type
of
Recurrent
Neural
Network 
(RNN)
architecture
that
is
commonly
used
in
machine
learning
for
processing
sequential
data, 
such
as
speech,
text,
and
time-series
data.
We
have
decided
to
use
Keras,
a
high-level
neural 
network
API
for
Python,
to
implement
LSTMs
as
a
layer
in
a
neural
network.
In
an
LSTM 
network,
the
hidden
state
is
updated
at
each
time
step
by
combining
the
values
of
the
input,
forget, 
and
output
gates,
and
the
memory
cells
are
updated
accordingly.
This
process
allows
the
LSTM
to 
selectively
store
or
forget
information
over
a
long
period
of
time,
making
it
well-suited
for
tasks 
such
as
speech
recognition,
natural
language
processing,
and
time-series
prediction.
Just
like
in 
Fig
6
,
features
such
as
process
names
and
dates
are
imported
as
inputs
and
multiple
hidden
layers 
are updated to output the next name/duration of the processes.
Fig 6
.
Simple Illustration of LSTM
We
train
LSTM
with
Mean
Squared
Error
as
the
loss
function.
For
a
regression
problem,
MSE
allows
the
model
to
update
its
parameters
through
back-propagation
due
to
its
differentiability.
In 
addition,
we
included
another
human-interpretable
measurement,
accuracy,
to
better
understand 
our
model’s
performance.
This
accuracy
is
based
on
whether
the
prediction
and
the
target
are 
within
an
arbitrary
margin
of
error
(we
chose
three
thresholds,
5,
10,
and
60
seconds).
This
is
to 
give
the
model
a
bit
of
leeway
for
when
it
predicts
the
amplitude
correctly
but
is
off
by
a
few 
seconds to a minute.
Furthermore,
we
removed
periods
from
Dec.
23rd,
2022
to
Jan.
7th,
2023
since
the
user
was
away 
from
his
PC
for
holidays,
which
could
potentially
bias
our
model’s
performance.
The
FireFox 
usage plot after the removal of aforementioned periods is shown in
Fig 7
.
Fig 7.  Usage over time for FireFox (with periods removed)
Then,
we
have
divided
logs
that
have
a
duration
exceeding
one
hour
into
separate
logs
with 
durations
corresponding
to
individual
hours.
This
is
to
align
with
the
specific
requirements
of
our 
tasks, which ask for the duration within a specified hour
(Fig 8)
.
Fig 8.
Split Up Logs Based on Duration
3    Results
3.1    Task 1 Results and Observations
In our analysis of the Hidden Markov Model, we evaluated the probability of applications being 
opened based on the current application being used. Our findings showed a strong correlation 
between the use of FireFox and League of Legends, Chrome, Discord, and Chrome and Talkdesk 
(
Fig 9
). This behavior aligns with my typical usage
patterns where I use FireFox and League of 
Legends for leisure activities and Chrome and various productivity apps for work. This 
demonstrates that the Hidden Markov Model is able to effectively capture my usage habits and 
make accurate predictions.
Fig 9. Probability of the next application for the 10 most used apps
Based on the results shown in
Fig. 10
, we found that
accuracy improved as N increased. This is 
because higher values of N allow for more tolerance for errors, resulting in increased accuracy. 
Eventually, we were able to achieve 75% accuracy with N=3 in predicting the next application by 
using HMM.
Fig 10. HMM Top-N Accuracy Result
3.2    Task 2 Experiments, Results and Observations
For
this
task,
we
have
experimented
with
the
same
model
structure,
but
with
several
different 
modifications including feature engineering and activation function.
3.2.1    Experiment 1
In
our
initial
experiment,
we
input
numerical
data
such
as
day
of
the
week,
day
of
the
month,
hour, 
minute,
date,
and
month,
as
well
as
binary
data
indicating
whether
it
was
a

holiday.
We
used
an
activation
function
that
combined
an
LSTM
with
a
Dense
(linear)
function. 
However,
the
results
were
unsatisfactory
on
both
the
training
and
testing
sets,
as
we
were
only 
able to capture a few sporadic spikes (
Fig 11
).

In
our
second
experiment,
we
applied
one-hot
encoding
to
features
that
are
better
represented
as 
categorical
data,
with
the
expectation
that
the
model
can
update
weights
on
one-hot-encoded 
features
accordingly.
This
resulted
in
better
performance
compared
to
the
previous
experiment 
(Fig. 12)
.

3.2.3    Experiment 3
In
our
third
experiment,
we
also
noticed
that
these
time-related
data
have
cyclic
nature,
meaning 
that
there
are
some
relations
between
time
that
are
close
together.
For
example,
events
at
4
PM 
could
be
more
related
to
events
at
5
PM
than
events
at
midnight.
Therefore,
we
applied
sine
and 
cosine
transformations
to
the
numerical
input.
While
this
approach
did
lead
to
a
reduction
in 
model size, the performance was slightly worse compared to the previous experiment (
Fig 13
).
Fig 13. Experiment 3 Plot
3.2.4    Experiment 4
Lastly,
we
observed
that
the
Dense
(linear)
function
in
our
previous
experiments
produced
some 
impossible
predictions
(values
less
than
0
and
greater
than
3600),
so
we
switched
to
a
Dense 
(sigmoid)
function
to
address
this
issue.
Additionally,
based
on
our
previous
experiment,
we 
reverted
back
to
using
one-hot
encoding
as
it
produced
better
predictions
compared
to
sine
and 
cosine
transformations.
As
a
result
of
these
changes,
we
achieved
good
accuracy
in
both
the
train 
and test sets (
Fig14
).

3.2.5    Best Experiment and Observations
Fig 15
shows a summary of the experiments and experiment
4 gave us the best prediction with a 
mean square error loss of 0.138 and an accuracy of 82% (
Fig16
). Importantly, we noticed a 
tradeoff between accuracy and input size. Particularly, one-hot encoding increases the model size 
by almost three times larger than models in other experiments due to the large input required. 
Large input size will lead to the curse of dimensionality and the larger model size will cause 
higher time and memory complexity which would get worse as the dataset gets larger.
Fig 15. Experiment Trials and Results
Fig 16. Experiment 4 Accuracy
In addition, when we compare the graph (
Fig 14
) of
the model’s performance to the table of 
results (
Fig 16
), we can see that the model does not
perform well on the testing set. The graph 
shows that the model fails to capture most of the spikes, which is in contrast to the high test 
accuracy reported in the table. This discrepancy may be due to the fact that the model is correctly 
predicting many 0s, which suggests that the accuracy metric may not be a good evaluation tool.
To address this issue, we could adjust our evaluation metric to penalize incorrect amplitude 
predictions more severely while reducing rewards for correctly predicting 0s. This approach aims 
to address the class imbalance between active and inactive usage and encourage the model to 
focus on learning the amplitude of usage time more accurately.
Moreover, the graph suggests that the model is able to effectively learn from the training set, but 
struggles to forecast future patterns. We hypothesize that the poor performance on unseen data is 
due to the insufficient dataset, as there are features in the testing set, such as day of the year and 
month, which are not present in the training set and thus make the model difficult to generalize.

Abstract
Working alongside with the intel technology team, our group spent the first quarter and
the winter break collecting many types of user activity data from a PC. We collected the
movement data of a mouse or data which applications users opened. And we collected data of the
foreground window duration, the class and the executive name of the application.W ith all this
data, we can use them to make further predictions about which application the user will probably
open at a certain time, and for how long on the desktop.
In this project, we first implemented the hidden markov model for predicting the next
application based on the current application opened on the windows. To increase the accuracy ,
we predict the next few possible applications instead of just a single one. Furthermore, we
implemented a Long short-term memory method based on the Recurrent neural network model
to predict the total time an application is used in the foreground.

Introduction
Nowadays, computers have become an inseparable part of our life, and most people
spend a majority of their time working with computers. To successfully work on a computer ,
users require dif ferent applications to complete dif ferent jobs, such as doc file for paperwork,
excel file for data processing, photoshop for image editing, etc. While people use their
computers, most of the time they may face computer lag, slow response time. This is very
frustrating, because it will reduce people’ s  productivity , decrease the performance of the
computers, and cause negative user experience. With the development of artificial intelligence,
we are able to solve this problem and boost the ef ficiency of computers by letting the computer
help me open the application and progress we need without telling the computer what we want.
Before building models for training, first we have to collect user PC data for further data
analysis.
In the first quarter , to collect the user PC data, we used dif ferent input libraries based on
the Intel XLSDK toolkit to collect data from our PC. After the collection during the winter break
and first quarter , we now have a handful of data to perform data analysis and solve the problems
we address during our proposal. Currently we have the data for a user for about two months,
mostly focusing on the application on foreground windows, including time, application name,
class, and executive name of the application. With this data, we implemented Hidden Markov
Model(HMM) to predict the next application a user is going to open and implemented a Long
short-term memory model(LSTM) to predict the application time usage.DSC180B       Solutions of Foreground Window Recommendations

Data Collection
With the help from the Intel team, we are able to collect data from PCs using XLSDK
tool kits. XLSDK is a set of libraries and tools developed by Intel to help data scientists to
extract information from a PC. By using XLSDK, we implemented several input libraries which
are modules that allow us to capture a specific dataset.
We implemented the user waits input library , the foreground window input library , mouse
input library and the desktop mapper input library . Since our goal is to make predictions about
which application the user will probably open at a certain time, and for how long on the desktop,
we mainly focus on implementing foreground windows input library and desktop mapper input
library because we want to access the data which contains the information of what applications
the user has used and how long did the application open for .
For the foreground windows input library , we built a data collector to extract the
information of the foreground windows of the user ’s PC. We log 1 1 variables into the database,
which are the process ID of the foreground application, the thread ID of the foreground
application, the top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right coordinate of a foreground window ,
whether the application is responsive, whether the application is in the Windows Store, the name
of the application, the image name of the application, and the class name of the application.
While we are dealing with the foreground window , most importantly , we use
GetForegroundW indow() to retrieve a handle to a current foreground window . Based on the
handle, we can record the process ID and the thread ID of a foreground window . Moreover ,
based on the handle, with the help of the function GetW indowT extW(), we can extract the name,
class and image of a foreground window . With the help of the function GetW indowRect(), we
can access and log the position of a foreground window . With all the information we collect forDSC180B       Solutions of Foreground Window Recommendations
5
the foreground window , we can make predictions about when and how the user likes the
application to be opened, so that we can pre-process the application for the user .
For the desktop mapper input library , it is similar to what we have done for the
foreground window input library , but instead of just monitoring the one window in the front, we
captured the entire desktop, and all the windows on the desktop. Besides all the important
features the foreground windows contains, now we can open and close the entire desktop, and we
can collect the data of the windows order , such that we can know which application is more
important than the others since the user put this window in the front, and we can know if the user
need multiple windows to complete his job or not, so that when we need to make pre-process for
the user , we can open all the windows user need instead of just one.
After our thoughtful consideration, we decided we should use the
foreground window
input library
to collect data for making predictions
on user application recommendation because
we care most about the application names and the time when the user opened the application.DSC180B       Solutions of Foreground Window Recommendations

2.1 For eground window IL  difficulty - Repetition
As we implemented the foreground window input library to collect data like application
names, images, classes as well as the time. One of the challenges we faced while implementing
the foreground window input library is the repetition of data. The data collector collects
information every 10 milliseconds. When the same foreground window remains opening for a
time period, the same data will be collected many times.
we don’ t want to log the same application foreground window records if the window keeps
opening because it is redundant. In order to solve this problem, we use the PID as an indicator so
that we can log the information as long as there is a change on the foreground windows. By
doing so, we can make the data cleaner for analyzing because we remove the meaningless
repetitions of data.

2.2 For eground window IL  difficulty - Unicode pr oblem
When we were implementing the foreground window input library and used it to collect
PC data, we noticed that sometimes the data shows “Missing String.” like the image shown
below .
Soon, we found out that the data collector could not recognize data which in another
language or uncommon symbols or characters. In order to show the missing data, we
implemented Unicode to deal with this problem. Unicode allows for the handling of a wide range
of characters from various languages. Unicode is a universal character encoding standard that
assigns a unique code point to each character in most of the world's writing systems. This means
that each character can be represented by a specific code that can be recognized and processed by
computers.
After solving the repetition and unicode problem, we are able to collect a relatively clean
and ready-to-use dataset for further analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
After we collected all the data using visual studio, we have about 52 dif ferent databases
in DB form, and the first thing we need to do is to mer ge all the dataset into one entire database.
We complete this step using the sqlite3 package, with the provided connect function, we can
convert all the db type of files into sql queries, and then we use the pandas function
read_sql_query to read all sql queries into pandas dataframe, then we call mer ge functions to
combined all these dataframes. Now we have the entire dataset, we then start the data cleaning
and EDA  steps. The first thing we try to accomplish is to split all the records into dif ferent
groups, like executable files, title of the files, class of the files, etc. First we tried using the
INPUT_ID column to determine which group does the records belong to, but soon we find out
there is a problem, since we collected 30 db files and have 30 dif ferent attempts instead of keep
the data collector running all the time, this cause a problem that the INPUT_IDs for each
databases are dif ferent. For some of the sql queries we can see 8, 9, 10, 1 1, but for others they
might be something else like 5,6,7,13, and this is totally random. To solve this problem, we
decided to first pick only the executable files since we can filter them out based on whether the
record ends with “.exe” or “.EXE”. With the filtered dataset, we then decided to conduct further
exploratory analysis.DSC180B       Solutions of Foreground Window Recommendations
9
The data consists of 12825 entries. Our data was collected from December 8th, 2022 to
February 10th, 2023. The data includes 1540 hours of PC usage which means that from
December 8th, 2022 to February 10th, 2023, the user used his PC for 1540 hours and we
collected all his foreground window activity .
The user had opened 51 unique PC applications including Microsoft Edge browser ,
Spotify , Microsoft Word and other commonly used applications. We first find out the most
frequently used application which is Microsoft Edge browser (msedge.exe), and we plot the top
10 most frequently used applications in a barplot. And from the plot we can see that it appears
DSC180B       Solutions of Foreground Window Recommendations
10
the user used the computer mainly for searching, studying and entertainment.
And based on this result, we also want to see if there will be a dif ference between the
most frequently used applications plot and the applications with the longest duration plot. We can
see that these two plots are slightly dif ferent, the user spends more time on entertainment
applications but less frequently using them, while the searching engines were frequently
accessed, the total time the user spends is not that long.
We also take a look at the time duration for the most frequently used application, the
microsoft edge, and below is the result, we can see that besides the daily usage of several
minutes, there are also some really outstanding long time duration of the application. Probably
DSC180B       Solutions of Foreground Window Recommendations
11
the user was watching long videos or reading long journals.

Methodology
4.1 Hidden Markov Model
First we decided to use the Hidden Markov model to make predictions about the next
applications the user will probably use given the previously used application. A Hidden Markov
Model is a type of statistical model that is often used to model sequences of events or
observations, where some aspects of the underlying process generating the data are unknown or
hidden. The idea behind HMM is that there is a sequence of hidden states that generate the
observed data, and these hidden states can only be inferred from the observed data. Think of it
like a game of 20 questions. You know some things about an object, but not everything. So, you
ask questions to try to determine the underlying hidden state that generated the data you have. In
HMM, the hidden states are like the object in the game of 20 questions, and the observed data are
like the answers to the questions. The key idea behind HMM is that the hidden states follow a
Markov process, which means that the current state only depends on the previous state. This
allows us to use mathematical techniques to make predictions about the future based on the past.
In summary , a Hidden Markov Model is a statistical model that is used to model sequences of
DSC180B       Solutions of Foreground Window Recommendations
12
data when there is some underlying structure that is not directly observable, but can be inferred
based on the observations.
In our project, the hidden state is the connection between the applications.W e can see this
kind of hidden connection and the hidden probability from the figure above. We can use this
figure as an example, starting with msedge.exe, it has 2 start probabilities that go to either spotify
or zoom. And for spotify and zoom, they have their own probabilities. Those probabilities came
from the hidden connections. As a human being we can easily figure out these kind of
connections, such as when you are working with a windows word file, you are more likely to
access the browser or visual code or other applications that related with studying, but when you
are currently playing games or watching videos, you probably won’ t open a word document all
of a sudden and start to do your work. And what we want to do here is to use the hidden markov
model to teach the computer about this hidden connection, and use this model to make
predictions based on the previous application the user is working with. To accomplish this, we
first implemented the start probability of all the applications appearing in the dataset. We do that
DSC180B       Solutions of Foreground Window Recommendations
13
by taking each applications’  count and dividing it by the sum of all the counts. And then for all
of the applications, computed the transition matrix, which is a matrix that indicates the
probability each application will be opened based on the application provided. This step is
conducted by repeating the same process that we do for the starting probability , but this time we
need to multiply by the probability of each previous application. Finally , we integrate all the
previous steps into a hidden markov model, and then we can test out the model with the entire
dataset split into training and testing data. Here is the heatmap showing the corresponding
correlation matrix of all the applications.
DSC180B       Solutions of Foreground Window Recommendations
14
Based on the correlation matrix, we can then use it to implement our prediction model.
To increase the accuracy , also to provide a more reasonable output, we include variable n to
represent the number of possible output we want, which is the applications that have the highest
n probabilities in our transition matrix. The total accuracy increased while n increased. Here is a
table showing how the total accuracy changed while variable n changed.

1
22.05%
2
33.82%
3
60.29%
6
69.85%
8
73.53%
From the table we can see, with this model, we developed our maximum accuracy to
73.53% with 8 possible results. Compared with general prediction models, the advantage for
HMM is we don’ t need to trace through the entire training dataset every time we make a
prediction. With the help of the transition matrix, we can easily search for the hidden connections
we need and return the result based on that.
4.2 LSTM Time Series For ecasting
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of deep learning model that is commonly
used for processing sequential data, such as natural language processing, and time series
prediction. Unlike traditional neural networks, RNNs have the ability to retain information from
previous time steps, which allows them to model the dependencies between elements in a
sequence. The basic idea behind RNNs is to have a hidden state which is passed from previousDSC180B       Solutions of Foreground Window Recommendations
15
step to the next, allowing the model to store information of the past inputs and use that
information to make predictions about future outputs. There are various types of RNNs,
including Simple RNNs, Long Short-T erm Memory (LSTM) networks, and Gated Recurrent
Units (GRUs).
We chose LSTM networks to help us make predictions on the time duration of a
foreground window , because LSTM can ef fectively capture short-term and long-term
dependencies in sequential data. LSTM can use memory cells and gates to control the flow of
information into and out of the memory cells so that when we input our data into the model, the
gates will determine when to add new information getting in the input gate and prevent irrelevant
information from being a part of the calculation by passing it into the for get gate. Therefore,
LSTM is widely used in time-series forecasting such as stock price prediction, sales forecasting,
traffic flow prediction, ener gy demand forecasting, and weather forecasting.
DSC180B       Solutions of Foreground Window Recommendations
16
Since we want to make a prediction on the application time usage along with the timeline,
LSTM is a good machine learning model to apply , which helps us achieve this task. We decided
to use the most frequently used application - Microsoft Edge browser(msedge.exe) as the
primary application to fit into the LSTM model because this application was used actively which
can be more representative as we put it into the LSTM model.
Before we implement the LSTM model, we first need to do feature engineering and
transform the data into a condition which is ready to use for the LSTM model. Firstly , we
extracted the time and categorized it to hour , minute, day , month. Then, we encoded the
application names and added it to the dataframe. Lastly , we added the time duration of each
foreground window into the dataframe.
\
After we extracted and filtered the data we needed for further use, we had to transform
the numerical data with MinMaxScaler which is to normalize the input variables.
DSC180B       Solutions of Foreground Window Recommendations
17
With the MinMaxScaler , the input variables will be scaled to range[0,1]. We wanted the
input variables to be scaled because variables are measured at dif ferent scales and do not
contribute equally to the model fitting, and thus end up with bias. Normalizing the input
variables can help improve the accuracy of the model and make it better fitted.
After standardizing the time duration of each query , we one-hot encoded the categorical
data which are hour , minute, day , and month. One-hot encoding is a process of converting
categorical data into a binary representation that can be easily processed by machine learning
algorithms. Each categorical variable is transformed into a binary vector of zeros and ones. The
reason that we used one-hot encoding is because categorical variables cannot be processed
directly by LSTM, which typically only work with numerical data. One-hot encoding transforms
categorical data into a numerical format that can be used as input to our LSTM model.
After feature engineering, we created a function to reshape the variable inputs which is
able to determine how many inputs can be passed into the model at a time. Then, we split the
input into a train set(80%) and a test set(20%).
Finishing all the data preparation process, we started to build our LSTM model. We
added 4 LSTM layers with 5, 10, 3, 10 units respectively following with a dropout layer . At the
end, we added a dense layer with 1 unit because we wanted the model outputs to be one
dimension after passing through all the LSTM layers.
DSC180B       Solutions of Foreground Window Recommendations
18
c
DSC180B       Solutions of Foreground Window Recommendations
19
Then, we plotted the loss of the training set and the test set.
From the above graph of loss of the training set and test, we found that the loss of both
sets dropped significantly at the beginning of 30 epochs and the loss of both sets conver ged after
30 epochs, which indicates that our LSTM model is ef fective.
As we go deeper , we scaled all the collected data and used the scaled data to make
predictions. And to analyze the accuracy of the scaled true value and prediction, we implemented
a threshold of 0.02 to check if the dif ference between predictions and true values are significant
or not. 0.02 is in a unit that data was standardized by using MinMaxScaler .
With the threshold, we can successfully measure the dif ference between the predicted and
true value, which then makes the accuracy up to 88.67%.

Futur e Expectation
5.1 Additional data
In our project, we only collect PC usage data for 3 months. We hope we can collect more
data to fit into the HMM and LSTM in the future which may help improve the accuracy of the
models. Firstly , having more data can help the model, especially LSTM, learn a more accurate
representation of the underlying patterns in the data, which can improve its ability to generalize
to new and unseen data, since LSTM is a type of time-series forecasting model. Secondly ,
collecting more data can help reduce overfitting by providing more examples for the model to
learn from.
5.2 User  Interface Development
Since we have successfully built a HMM model to predict the next application a user is
going to open based on the current foreground window , we hope we can build a user interface for
users to help them open the application they may want to open next faster . The user interface is
like a taskbar located at the bottom of the window . There will be four applications shown on the
taskbar which correspond to the four most possible applications which the user is going to open
next. Users can easily access the recommended applications through the application icons on the
taskbar .
5.3 for eground window auto adjustment
We have collected foreground window position data while we implemented the
foreground window input library but those data have not been used in this project. In the future,
we hope we can utilize that data to generate a machine learning model to predict the size and
position of a foreground window which can help users make adjustments to their foreground
window automatically .DSC180B       Solutions of Foreground Window Recommendations

5.4 Identify and close pop-up harassment windows
Often, when people are browsing on the internet, some pop-up harassment windows will
suddenly show up from nowhere, which seriously af fects the user experience on a PC. People
really hate these kinds of harassment messages. By analyzing foreground window data we
collected, in the future, we are able to identify and close pop-up harassment windows for users.
Most of the time, the user will close the window as soon as this kind of window shows up, so the
time duration of this opening window is very short. In this situation, we will assign a ‘spam’
score to it. If the window with the same application name, image, and class shows up multiple
times and was canceled immediately multiple times, we will assign a higher and higher ‘spam’
score to the window . If it passes a threshold we set, this window would be classified as ‘spam’.
When the window shows up next time, it will be closed as soon as possible by using our
algorithm.
6.
Conclusion
Studying user ’s application usage habits, prediction the user application launch and usage
time, improving PC user experience are our objectives. Beginning from the data collection part,
we have built input libraries from scratch, and we used those input libraries to create a data
collector to fetch data that we need for building the prediction models. We mainly used the data
collected with the foreground window input library on our prediction models.
After cleaning and filtering the data, we constructed an HMM model to achieve
foreground application recommendation by predicting the next applications which the user isDSC180B       Solutions of Foreground Window Recommendations
22
going to open next based on the current foreground window . We also built a LSTM model to
predict the application time usage of the most frequently used application.
With all the work we developed in our entire project and all these high accuracy results of
our prediction compared to the real value, we can now come back to the question we introduced
in the beginning, can we now use the user ’s data we collected, to build up an application
prediction and recommendation system for the user? I believe that the answer will be yes. Within
our project, we can already predict the user ’s next possible applications with a relatively high
accuracy , and also we can predict the duration of dif ferent applications. So if we combine these
two models together , we can build up a system that opens and closes applications for the user ,
and the user will be more ef ficient during his working experience. And with more and more data
having been collected, we believe the accuracy of the model will also increase a lot. From here,
the next step we will focus on is to identify pop up windows for the user , such as all those
harassment advertisements, or those pop-up windows installed with the application itself, and try
to close them in advance before the user even notices them.DSC180B       Solutions of Foreground Window Recommendations

1. Abstract
Regardless
of
what
operating
systems
are
being
used,
most
users
are
familiar
with
the
data
loading
icon,
which
signals
an
unpleasant
user-wait
experience.
The
amount
of
waiting
time
can
be
varied
across
the
devices
and
the
applications
that
are
launched;
for
instance,
some
apps
such
as
MSPaint,
Zoom,
and
Fornite
can
take
approximately
9,
12,
and
16
seconds
on
average
to
launch
respectively
[1].
As
the
problem
adversely
affects
user
experience,
and
limited
research
was
previously
conducted
in
this
field,
we
perform
a
study
to
collect
user-app
interaction
data,
analyze
past
behaviors
to
understand
the
user-wait
events,
and
propose
solutions
to
reduce
such
waiting
times.
In
particular ,
we
collect
user
data
over
multiple
weeks
using
Intel’ s
XLSDK,
which
stands
for
Input,
Actuator ,
or
Logger
Libraries
Softwar e
Development
Kit
[2].
Using
these
data
with
Statistical
and
Machine
Learning
methods
–
namely
Hidden
Markov
Model
and
Long
Short-T erm
Memory
(LSTM)
model
–
we
are
able
to
predict
the
usual
wait
time
when
a
user
opens
an
app
so
that
we
can
launch
the
app
beforehand,
and
the
user
can
quickly
perform
their
crucial tasks on the app without the long and unnecessary waiting time.
2. Introduction
The
user-wait
is
an
undesirable
experience
when
opening
an
app.
This
is
indicated
by
a
rolling
rainbow
beach
ball
(on
a
Mac
machine)
or
a
spinning
blue
circle
next
to
the
mouse
cursor
(on
a
Windows/Linux
machine).
Such
symbols
are
busy
cursors,
demonstrating
that
the
processes
execute
other
operations
and
need
to
set
a
busy
state
to
the
cursors
[3].
As
a
result,
the
users
have
to
wait
for
the
other
processes
to
complete
running
and
the
busy
cursors
to
finally
disappear
so
that
they
can
start
interacting
with
the
apps
again.
The
waiting
time
is
unexpected;
some
might
take
only
a
few
seconds,
but
others
can
last
a
few
minutes.
Nevertheless,
in
today’ s
world,
time
is
of
the
utmost
importance.
When
interacting
with
any
application,
if
there
is
a
long
running
or
loading
time,
people
will
turn
away
from
the
application
because
of
its
poor
performance
on
any
operating
system.
Ten
to
twenty
years
ago,
this
was
not
a
problem.
Back
then,
it
was
understood
that
applications
could
take
time.
However ,
today ,
with
the
progression
of
technology ,
applications
are
competing
with
each
other
to
retain
users,
and
the
best
way
to
do
so
is
by
having
the
user
wait
time
on
the
application
be
as
small
as
possible
so
that
the
user
can
have
the
best
experience
possible.
Hence,
our
goal
is
to
be
able
to
predict
the
app
launch
patterns,
specifically
by
collecting
the
data
using
the
methods
we
have
learned
in
the
last
10
weeks.
Even
though
this
research
topic
can
vastly
enhance
the
user
experience,
we
can
hardly
find
a
similar
formerresearch
paper
or
methodology
to
build
upon.
Therefore,
with
the
guidance
of
the
Intel
experts,
we
took
initiative
in
exploring
how
to
collect
data
to
be
able
to
use
it
to
predict
app
launch
patterns
and
set
some
success
criteria
using
Intel’ s
telemetry
framework,
which
included
(1)
successfully
writing
functional
collection
modules
for
the
Intel®
System
Usage
Report
(SUR),
(2)
performing
prediction
models
(HMM
and
LSTM/RNN)
with
an
accuracy
of
more
than
50%,
and
(3)
enhance
the
app
launch
behavior
by
50%+
to
better
the
overall
user
experience
[4].
Finally ,
the
tools
we
used
in
this
project
are
comprised
of
(1)
Intel’ s
XLSDK,
(2)
programming
languages,
namely
C
and
Python,
(3)
Version
Control
System
-
GitHub,
as
well
as
(4)
Tableau
for
visualizations.
To
analyze
the
data
that
we
collect,
we
plan
to
use
the
Hidden
Markov
Model
(HMM)
to
predict
the
next
application
that
will
be
opened
by
the
user
and
Long
Short-T erm
Memory
(LSTM)
model
to
predict
the
duration
spent
on
a
particular
application
by
the
user
.
This
will
provide
us
insight
into
how
to
reduce
the
load
time
for
these
applications
and
allow
us
to give solutions to reduce user wait time.
3. Methodology
3.1 Methodology of Data Collection
During
the
first
10
weeks,
we
constantly
wrote
code
to
record
different
kinds
of
data
from
our
individual
desktops/laptops
in
relation
to
our
system
usage
data.
To
accomplish
this,
we
first
familiarized
ourselves
with
the
Intel®
System
Usage
Report
(SUR),
a
data-collection
and
analysis
framework
that
enables
us
to
anonymously
gather
data
usage
from
each
device
and
analyze
such
data
from
multiple
devices
[5].
Accompanying
the
Intel®
SUR
collector ,
the
ESRV
(ener gy
server)
toolchain
was
also
introduced
and
got
set
up
on
the
machine
on
which
we
collected
the
data.
We
then
studied
the
XLSDK
User
Guide
to
develop
various
input
libraries
(ILs),
namely
Mouse-Input,
User-Wait,
Foreground
Window ,
and
Desktop
Mapper
ILs.
In
general,
each
one
of
these
input
libraries
extracts
data
alongside
the
timestamps,
and
we
will
further explain these input libraries as well as their functions in the below section.
a) Mouse-Input IL
Introduced
in
week
1
of
the
Fall
quarter ,
the
Mouse-Input
IL
was
used
to
familiarize
ourselves
with
the
Windows
machine
and
help
us
delve
into
understanding
ESRV
plus
SUR
using
XLSDK.
As
this
was
our
first
input
library ,
we
were
provided
with
step-by-step
instructions
on
how
to
write
the
code
from
the
Intel
team.
The
main
purpose
of
Mouse-Input
IL
is
to
capture
the
mouse
(X,
Y)
positions
in
pixels,
with
or
without
noise
[11].
In
other
words,
this
input
library
collects
the
mouse
movements
being
controlled
by
the
user,
and
we
collect
the
X
and
Y
positions
of
the
mouse
on
the
screen.
We
can
control
the
intervals
in
which
we
wish
to
collect
the
data,
allowing
us
to
control
the
amount
of
data
we
acquire
over
a
span
of
time.
The
major
logic
of
the
Mouse-Input
library
relies
upon
the
static_standar d_input
sample
template,
which
assists
us
in
understanding
the
concepts,
creating
the
IL,
and
collecting
the
data
as
desired.
Furthermore,
we
update
the
Mouse-Input
to
also
track
the
noise
in
the
X
and
Y
positions.
This
is
accomplished
byapplying
a
1D
Kalman
predictor
per
dimension.
In
particular ,
we
add
some
noise
to
create
noisy
mouse
X
and
Y
positions
measured
in
pixels,
then
utilize
the
1D
Kalman
predictor
to
compute
the predicted signal of those X and Y coordinates.
The sample outputs are demonstrated in the following figures

: A part of our
test_key-000000.csv
output dataset
which shows what input from the mouse positions are being collected

IL [11]
–-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Figur e
: Sample scatter plots of the mouse movements
when captured at a frequency of
1 Hz (left) and 100 Hz (right) [1 1]
b) User-Wait IL
The
User-Wait
is
the
next
input
library
we
implemented.
In
contrast
to
the
above
Mouse-Input,
we
had
to
build
this
ourselves.
However ,
we
were
able
to
reuse
parts
of
the
code
from
Mouse-Input
IL
and
continued
developing
the
source
code.
The
User-Wait
IL
is
used
to
retrieve
the
cursor
type
and
its
timestamp.
We
had
to
build
a
collector
thread
that
monitored
the
state
of
the
cursor
icon
during
intervals.
Once
again,
the
span
of
these
intervals
can
be
controlled
by
us,
which
allows
adjustment
in
the
amount
of
data
collected.
The
collected
data
–
which
describes
the
cursor
–
can
vary
from
a
standard
arrow
to
an
arrow
with
a
spinning
wheel.
We
also
collected
data
using
this
input
library
on
whether
the
mouse
is
static
or
dynamic.
Therefore,
such
information is useful in predicting the cursor icon and state.

test_key-0000001.csv
output
dataset
which shows what input from the mouse cursor is being collected
Figur e
: Example of data loading icons [1 1]
c) Foreground Window IL
Next,
we’ll
introduce
the
Foreground
Window
IL.
At
this
point,
we
had
gotten
a
basic
understanding
of
how
to
build
Input
Libraries
and
also
incorporate
Windows
APIs
to
provide
us
with more useful information.
When
implementing
this
library ,
we
also
apply
the
knowledge
of
the
hook_input
,
whose
general
purpose
is
to
use
a
system
hook
to
track
the
UI
objects
clicked
by
the
mouse.
Simply
put,
whenever
we
use
the
mouse,
it
generates
a
message,
and
the
hook
will
notify
the
operating
system
about
this
information.
Some
inputs
that
we
can
collect
from
the
mouse
hook
are
the
X,
and
Y
positions
in
pixels,
the
clicked
UI
object’ s
name,
ID,
root
ID,
class
name,
style,
extended
style, and the clicked UI object’ s owning process image as shown in the following database.
Figur e
: A part of our
test-0000002.db
output dataset
which shows what inputs from the mouse cursor are being collected
Now ,
let’s
go
back
to
our
Foreground
Window .
We
use
the
Foreground
Window
input
library
to
extract
and
log
the
application's
name
that
sits
the
furthest
up
front,
along
with
its
position,
size,
and
other
information.
In
particular ,
we
utilized
two
events
as
triggers
for
this
input
library;
they
are
the
mouse
click
and
the
time
tick.
In
fact,
we
can
detect
a
change
in
the
foreground
window
using
the
mouse
click,
and
we
include
a
time
tick
in
cases
where
there
is
no
mouse
click,
but
there
exists
a
change
to
the
foreground
window ,
such
as
when
using
the
task
scheduler .
With
those
two
triggers,
we
can
retrieve
the
handle
of
the
foreground
window
and
check
if
the
handle
is
valid.
After
that,
we
further
extract
and
split
the
window
name
by
the
separator
character
forward
flash
“/”
to
obtain
only
the
window’ s
title
bar
instead
of
the
whole
file
path.
This
will
prevent
us
from
exposing
the
user’s
personal
identifiable
information
(PII).
Similarly ,
we
collect
the
module
name,
which
is
the
.exe
name
rather
than
the
complete
path
to
the
foreground
window ,
thus
handling
privacy
issues
as
well.
We
also
obtain
the
window’ s
class
name
to
further
supply
useful
detail
for
the
analysis
and
predictions
in
Quarter
2’s
project.
In
addition,
the
window
rectangle’ s
dimensions
are
recorded
by
retrieving
the
X
and
Y
coordinates
on
the
upper -left
and
lower -right
corners
using
GetW indowRect()
and
the
object
type
RECT
(which
is
short
for
“rectangle”).
Lastly ,
we
can
verify
if
the
window
app
is
immersive
and
is
hung
or
not
by
using
IsImmersiveProcess()
and
IsHungAppW indow()
functions.
In
particular ,
“is_immersive”
checks
if
the
application
is
a
Windows
Store
application,
and
we
capture
“is_hung”,
which
checks
if
the
application
is
responsive
or
not.
A
few
other
functions
from
Windows
APIs
that
we
use
are
WaitForSingleObject,
which
waits
until
the
object
is
in
the
signaled
state
(i.e.
receiving
the
STOP_SIGNAL
to
exit
the
loop)
or
until
the
time-out
interval
elapses,
and
we
use
GetForegroundW indow
to
retrieve
the
handle
of
the
foreground
window ,
etc.
[10]

: A sample data of our
test-000067.db
database

(ID_INPUT  = 3), image name (ID_INPUT  = 4), and class name (ID_INPUT  = 5)
d) Desktop Mapper IL
The
final
input
library
we
worked
on
last
quarter
was
the
Desktop
Mapper .
This
input
library
was
the
most
challenging
input
library
to
develop
so
far.
We
initially
struggled
to
understand
how
to
use
it.
However ,
with
the
help
of
the
Intel
team
and
our
peers,
we
were
able
to
create
it
to
the
extent
that
it
recorded
data
from
the
desktop
window .
When
triggered,
the
desktop
mapper
input
library
maps
all
the
open
application
windows
in
z-order
and
stores
information
about
each
one
of
them,
such
as
their
position
on
the
screen
and
their
individual
sizes
as
well.
More
specifically ,
the
z-order
“shows
a
window's
position
when
given
a
list
of
overlapping
windows.
The
z-axis
points
outward
from
the
screen,
where
the
top
window
of
the
z-order
overlaps
all
other
windows,
and
the
bottom
window
is
overlapped
by
all
other
windows
on
the
z-order
axis.
The
z-order
gives
us
a
nice
way
of
visualizing
the
order
of
the
windows
on
the
screen,
and
we
can
connect
this
with
the
geometry
field
to
better
understand
how
the
windows
are
positioned
on
the
screen”
[12]
.
Besides,
the
desktop
mapper
requires
us
to
understand
the
use
of
“private
data”,
which
essentially
means
we
can
store
any
data
we
want
and
decide
how
we
want
to
store
them.
For
example,
the
private
data
can
be
the
window’ s
z-order
or
the
monitor ’s
enumeration
rank
[12]
.
Additionally ,
just
like
the
Foreground
Window
IL,
we
capture
if
the
window
“is_immersive”
and
“is_hung”.
A
few
other
functions
from
Windows
APIs
that
we
use
are
GetW indowProcessId,
IsWindowV isible,
IsZoomed,
GetT opW indow ,
etc.
The
use
of
these
functions
can
be
understood
from their names themselves.

test_key-000088.csv
output dataset
which shows what inputs are captured by the desktop mapper IL
Methodology of Data Collection - Summary
The
code
we
created
to
collect
data
was
developed
in
C
and
run
on
Microsoft
Visual
Studio
Community
2019.
Each
time
we
run
our
project
solutions
(.sln
files),
the
data
is
generated
and
stored
in
three
separate
files
with
the
following
naming
convention:
test_key-000000.csv ,
test_timing-000000.csv ,
and
test-000000.db
[6].
Specifically ,
the
sequence
000000
is
used
to
denote
the
order
in
which
the
file
is
generated.
It
will
be
automatically
enumerated
every
time
we
rerun
the
project
solution.
The
key
file
(e.g.
test_key-000000.csv)
explains
the
column
names
of
the
timing
and
data
files,
whereas
the
timing
file
(e.g.
test_timing-000000.csv)
stores
the
execution
time
for
each
SUR
collector ’s
component
and
each
data
sample
taken
[7].
The
test-000000.db
–
as
its
extension
filename
suggests
–
is
a
database
file,
and
the
(optional)
error
file might be generated if the project solution has bugs.
As
we
wanted
to
study
the
user-app
interactions,
we
tracked
the
app
launches
in
the
time
series
format.
To
collect
such
information,
we
used
the
inputs
from
the
mouse
click,
mouse
cursor ,
the
foreground
window ,
and
desktop
mapper
via
the
input
libraries
we
built
earlier .
These
ILs
allow
us
to
get
the
positions
of
the
cursor
on
the
screen,
capture
the
mouse
movements
and
activities,
and
report
the
change
of
the
foreground
windows
as
well
as
the
desktops
and
the
monitors
over
time.
Some
helpful
APIs
when
collecting
data
from
the
user
side
can
be
found
in
the
above
sections, where we discuss each input library in detail.
As
a
result,
the
data
collected
from
these
ILs
are
crucial
factors
in
keeping
track
of
user-app
interactions,
with
specific
records
of
the
mouse
locations,
changes
in
the
user
interface,
as
well
as
user
activities.
Consequently ,
we
will
be
able
to
understand
the
overall
patterns
of
using
the
Windows
machine
of
a
user;
then,
we
can
predict
when
a
user
opens
an
app,
make
comparisons
and
understand
which
apps
take
the
longest
time
to
launch,
and
make
precise
predictions
in
app
launching time.
Lastly ,
when
collecting

3.2 Methodology of Predictive Models
In
this
section,
we
will
quickly
explain
the
conceptual
aspects
of
our
prediction
models.
The
two
main
problems
we
need
to
resolve
are
(1)
predicting
the
probability
of
using
an
app,
given
the
former
sequence
of
application
usage
and
(2)
predicting
the
use
time
of
an
application
in
the
foreground window .
a). Pr oblem 1: HMM
The first task motivates the use of conditional probabilities due to the word “given” in the
problem statement. In general, we have the formula:
. Besides, we notice the𝑃(𝐴|𝐵) = 𝑃(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵)𝑃(𝐵)
Markov Chain strongly assumes that only the current state plays the most crucial role in
predicting the future in the sequence, and any other states before the that will not influence the
future states. In other words, the Markov Assumption can be briefly described by
, where
are the states (for
)𝑃(𝑞𝑖 = 𝑎 | 𝑞1𝑞2...𝑞𝑖−1) = 𝑃(𝑞𝑖= 𝑎 | 𝑞𝑖−1)𝑞𝑘𝑘 ∈ {1, 2, ..., 𝑖}
[14]. Applying this logic, we can derive a transition probability
as the probability of moving𝑎𝑖𝑗
from state
to state
. For example, the transition
from using a “chrome.exe” to a “cmd.exe” is𝑖𝑗
calculated by the likelihood of using “cmd.exe”, given that we have just used “chrome.exe”, with
the formula:𝑃(𝑐𝑚𝑑.𝑒𝑥𝑒 | 𝑐ℎ𝑟𝑜𝑚𝑒.𝑒𝑥𝑒)
,= 𝑃(𝑐ℎ𝑟𝑜𝑚𝑒.𝑒𝑥𝑒, 𝑐𝑚𝑑.𝑒𝑥𝑒)𝑃(𝑐ℎ𝑟𝑜𝑚𝑒.𝑒𝑥𝑒) = 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑎𝑖𝑟 𝑜𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑐ℎ𝑟𝑜𝑚𝑒.𝑒𝑥𝑒 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑐𝑚𝑑.𝑒𝑥𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑜𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑐ℎ𝑟𝑜𝑚𝑒.𝑒𝑥𝑒
Thus, a Markov chain helps us quickly figure out the probability for a sequence containing
observable events. Nevertheless, confronting the hidden (i.e. unobserved) events requires us to
consider implementing a Hidden Markov Model instead. According to Jurafsky and Martin, such
a model enables us to interact with both observed and hidden events, allowing the generalization
of sequence profiles. Apart from the above Markov Assumption, we have to take into account
another assumption called “Output Independence”. In short, the probability of observing an event
only relies on the state
that directly
produced
. This can be demonstrated by the
formula𝑜𝑖𝑞𝑖𝑜𝑖
, where
is a sequence of𝑃(𝑜𝑖 | 𝑞1 ... 𝑞𝑖 , ..., 𝑞𝑇, 𝑜1, ..., 𝑜𝑖, ..., 𝑜𝑇) = 𝑃(𝑜𝑖 | 𝑞𝑖)𝑜1𝑜2...𝑜𝑇
observations of length T, and
denote the
states [14]. Together , the two𝑞1, 𝑞2 , ...,𝑞𝑇𝑇
assumptions allow us to understand the idea of the first-order HMM, which can be used to
predict the next value based on the previous state sequence.Now , considering our case specifically , we can denote the
hidden states
as the executables,
namely “VsDebugConsole.exe”, “explorer .exe”, or “ShellExperienceHost.exe”. The
observations
can be the apps/tabs such as “Y outube”,
“Netflix”, and “Hulu”. Additionally , the
start pr obabilities
indicate the probability of a
state when it appears first in the sequence. For
instance, the start probability of “chrome.exe” would be
“chrome.exe” comes first in the𝑃(
sequence). The
emission pr obabilities
are the likelihood
of moving from one executable to an
app/tab. Or we can also define the emission probabilities as the likelihood of emitting some types
of actions. For example, from “chrome.exe” to “Y outube”, we can have the emission probability
to be
, which can be understood
as the chance of watching Youtube𝑃(𝑌𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑢𝑏𝑒 | 𝑐ℎ𝑟𝑜𝑚𝑒.𝑒𝑥𝑒)
when the user has just used Chrome, and the calculation of
emission pr obabilities
is similar to
the ones demonstrated above.
b). Pr oblem 2: RNN (V anilla, LSTM, and GRU)
The second task requires the use of time series, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) will be a
good fit for solving problems related to forecasting sequenced data. There are three main
characteristics of RNNs. Firstly , RNNs introduce a looping mechanism, where the current
prediction is impacted by the former predictions. An analogy of this is how our brain recognizes
the patterns of the alphabetical order “ABCD…” by using the sequential information of a text
[15]. Secondly , RNNs share parameters (i.e. the weight matrices W’s) across the timestamps and
across the positions. Hence, RNNs with more parameters will take more computational costs in
training [15]. Thirdly , RNNs can easily face the gradient problems of vanishing or exploding.
More specifically , the vanishing problem means the parameter update step will become
insignificant once the gradient diminishes, whereas the update step becomes highly lar ge when
there exists a fast increase in the gradient [15].
Figur e
: (from left to right): (1) An example of the
structure of RNN,
(2)-(3) the vanishing and exploding gradient problems [15]
In our case, each dataset used in a model is obtained from a particular user over some period of
time, so we may observe trends and seasonality , with some temporal features in our noisy data,
and these properties can be feasibly handled by RNNs. We consider three cases of RNNs, namely
Vanilla, LSTM, and GRU RNNs. In contrast to LSTM, Vanilla RNNs do not have a cell state;
they only have hidden states that serve as the memory for RNNs. LSTM, on the other hand, has
the cell states along with the hidden states, so it allows the addition or removal of information to
and from the cell. Such characteristics of LSTM are regulated by the “gates” [16]. In comparison
to LSTM, GRU utilizes fewer training parameters, so it requires less memory and achieves a
faster execution time. However , the drawback of GRU would be that it becomes less accurate
than LSTM when working with longer sequenced data. Overall, our project will be more inclined
toward exploring the performance of LSTM RNNs.
4. Data Analysis
In
this
section,
we
will
first
discuss
Exploratory
Data
Analysis
(EDA).
Initially ,
the
raw
data
is
collected
through
the
various
processes
described
in
this
paper .
The
Mouse-Input
IL
first
collects
the
coordinates
of
mouse
movement.
The
User-wait
IL
collects
the
cursor
type
and
status
along
with
a
timestamp,
providing
valuable
data
regarding
the
static
or
dynamic
nature
of
the
cursor ,
allowing
for
cursor
state
prediction
down
the
line.
The
Mouse-Hook
uses
a
system
hook
to
record
the
UI
icons
that
the
cursor
clicked.
Foreground-W indow
IL
collects
the
various
metadata
in
regard
to
programs
running
while
the
data
collection
process
is
happening.
This
allows
for
data
collection
regarding
the
type
of
file
being
run
and
whether
or
not
the
process
is
hung.
Desktop-Mapper
IL
collects
data
regarding
the
positions
of
all
items
while
the
data
collection
process
occurs.
All
of
these
sources
are
combined
to
provide
the
raw
data
we
are
looking
to
cleanse.
4.1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The
first
step
in
EDA
is
to
clean
the
data
that
we
have
collected.
This
step
requires
us
to
drop
undesired
columns
and
check
for
null
values
in
each
existing
column.
Upon
looking
further
into
the
data
that
was
collected,
we
discerned
that
the
data
from
our
Foreground-W indow
IL
would
be
best
suited
for
our
prediction
model.
To
understand
the
data
collected,
we
look
at
the
schema
of the data that was collected as shown in the below figure.Figur e
: Schema of Foreground-W indow IL
We
then
made
sure
that
each
value
of
the
data
was
of
the
correct
data
type.
Further
evaluating
the
data,
we
noticed
there
were
instances
where
our
data
contained
“Missing
String.”
in
a
few
rows
in relation to a few applications as shown in a figure named
“Timestamp with “Missing String.”
Figur e
: Timestamp with “Missing String.”
After
our
thorough
investigation,
we
came
to
realize
that
this
was
because
we
were
not
saving
the
name
of
the
window
in
Unicode,
and
therefore,
special
characters
were
not
being
recorded;
instead,
it
was
showing
us
the
“Missing
String.”
However ,
upon
fixing
this,
there
were
still
instances
where
the
file
explorer
tab
returned
an
empty
string
when
it
was
accessed
from
the
Shell Tray as shown in Figure
“Timestamp with an empty
string”
.
Figur e
: Timestamp with an empty string
To
keep
everything
consistent,
we
decided
to
impute
both
the
“Missing
String.”
and
the
empty
entries
(related
to
the
File
Explorer)
with
empty
strings.
Imputation
allowed
these
rows
to
be
used
without
affecting
the
overall
distribution
of
the
data.
Even
though
there
were
imputations
implemented
in
our
pre-processing
step,
they
did
not
affect
our
data
as
we
mainly
worked
with
application names.
Next,
we
looked
at
the
spread
of
the
data
and
calculated
the
use
time
for
each
instance
of
the
recorded
data.
We
looked
into
the
top
10
most
used
applications
in
terms
of
time
spent
on
them
and created a scatter plot to see if there were any outliers.
Figur e
: Use time of applications in seconds
It
can
be
seen
that
chrome.exe
has
two
instances
of
time
recorded
that
are
about
20000
seconds.
We
did
not
consider
this
to
be
something
wrong
with
the
data,
but
rather
it
seemed
to
be
aligned
with a student’ s usage of Chrome.
We
also
draw
bar
charts
to
explore
and
summarize
the
trend
of
the
user’s
usage
time
across
the
top 5 used apps.
Figur e
: Application use time in hours
In addition, we also created several data visualizations through the use of Tableau. Providing
visual analysis is essential to truly understand the user system used throughout the day . An
example of such analysis can be seen below:
Figur e
: Area Graph of Daily Time Spent on Processes
(in seconds)
Figur e
: Process Runtime
The above two charts simply show the usage of processes in terms of elapsed time for a given
day. From visualizations like the bar chart, we can see the lar gest contributor to the data collected
on a given day is Chrome, but the area chart adds an additional layer of information regarding
the distribution of chrome usage across the entire day . In this way , these visualizations
supplement one another well. On top of these visualizations, we also focused on the use of time
series analysis to further note patterns in the data:
Here we can see the time-series analysis of process usage for three dif ferent days. The chart
shows the distribution for the top 5 most frequently used processes throughout the 3-day period.
When the data is split by days, we can see patterns that didn't emer ge before such as the absence
of ApplicationFrameHost on the second day . The presence or absence of processes tells a story
regarding how the user spent their time collecting their data and could lead to interesting
insights. When combining all of the processes and all of the days together in a single
visualization, you get a time series analysis that looks similar to a calendar , allowing for a full
understanding of the user ’s data collection:
Figur e
: Day / Hour Process Usage
4.2 Data Analysis Using HMM
Next,
we
use
all
the
cleaned
data
and
preprocess
them
to
be
run
through
the
Hidden
Markov
Model and Long-Short Term Memory Model.
Hidden
Markov
Model
(HMM)
is
a
statistical
model
to
predict
the
next
value
based
on
the
sequence
of
the
previous
states.
It
uses
the
Markov
chain
which
is
a
sequence
of
possible
events
where
the
probability
of
each
event
only
depends
on
the
state
attained
in
the
previous
event.
[13]
More
information
about
the
theoretical
aspect
of
HMM
can
be
found
in
section
3.2
a).
To
be
able
to
mimic
this,
we
create
a
transition
and
emission
matrices.
A
transition
matrix
consists
of
the
probabilities
of
going
from
one
executable
to
another .
An
emission
matrix
consists
of
the
probabilities
of
going
from
one
executable
to
another
app
or
tab
(or
showing
an
emission
of
some
types
of
actions).
To
be
able
to
create
these
matrices,
we
have
to
preprocess
the
data.
Since
we
are
looking
only
at
executables
and
the
applications/tabs,
we
extract
from
the
Foreground
Window only those data that have ID-INPUT  values of 3 and 4.
The data preprocessing step for HMM includes the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to
greatly improve the accuracy of our predictions. Before the text processing, we saw instances of
multiple distinct records being associated with the same tabs/apps. This happened due to the
description of particular apps/tabs being more detailed than they were intended to be. For
instance, “DSC180A  – Google Doc – Google Chrome” and “DSC180B – Google Doc – Google
Chrome” should both be referred to as the same tab name “Google Doc – Google Chrome”. The
purpose of text processing is to identify the presence of a tab/app instead of the whole tab’ s/app’ s
description and isolate just that portion of the text to replace the original text. The collected data
made this process easier by keeping the variations in the tab/app description fairly uniform.
Correcting such descriptions allowed for the emission probability calculations to be unaf fected
by the improper split of identical tab/app names.
In
this
process,
we
first
split
the
data
into
training
and
testing
sets
-
each
representing
80%
and
20%
of
the
entire
dataset,
respectively .
We
then
input
these
data
into
our
program
that
learns
the
Markov
chain
and
creates
a
transition
matrix.
Once
we
train
the
data
on
our
training
set,
we
then
run
it
on
our
test
set
and
calculate
the
accuracy
of
the
model.
To
calculate
the
accuracy ,
we
decide
that:
The
prediction
is
considered
accurate
as
long
as
the
prediction
falls
in
the
top
n
(number
of
applications)
probabilities
calculated
for
that
specific
app.
As
the
value
of
n
increases,
the
prediction
accuracy
increases
as
well.
The
code
artifact
of
this
section
can
be
found on our
GitHub
. The results of HMM will be discussed
in more detail within section 5.
4.3 Data Analysis Using LSTM/RNN
Finally , we move to analyze data using LSTM/RNN. We conduct many experiments to finally
find out the ones that work for our data. For the reader ’s convenience, we would like to reiterate
the problem statement:
Predict the
duration
a user
spends on an app
within an hour
, given the
past time-series data.
Initially , we observe the
periodical occurr ence
of
the days of the week as well as the hours of the
day, so we choose to incorporate those elements into our model by applying
sine
function
transformation. Later , we also try out the
one-hot
encoding
of the weekdays because this
technique allows us to turn categorical data like Monday to Sunday into numerical data that can
be fit into the model. Unfortunately , these feature engineering trials do not give good predictive
results. Hence, we continue thinking of how to utilize the fact that the current timestamp depends
on the patterns of the previous timestamps. In fact, if we look closely at the usage pattern, we can
observe there are times (namely , from 1 am to 7:30 am) when the users go to sleep and stop
using the app, which results in zero values in the amount of usage. After waking up and starting
working, the users continuously use the device until the end of the day . We notice the
lookback
technique is able to observe what happens at some timesteps right before the current time point,
and since it can detect changes in the user ’s activity on an app, it gives better predictive results
and can capture both the peak time usage as well as the low time usage.
Using such feature engineering, we’ve tried multiple models such as Vanilla RNN, simple LSTM
with just one LSTM layer and one Dense output layer , as well as the Bidirectional LSTM model.
The accuracy is calculated based the percentage of predictions that are within some small
distance from themselves to the real values. Additionally , we used Root Mean Squared Error ,RMSE =
,
as another performance metrics. More information𝑖 = 1𝑛∑(𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑𝑖 − 𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖)2
𝑁
about these model structure/performance can be found in the later section.
While working with the LSTM models, we also come up with another problem statement.
Specifically , using the collected data and some data manipulation, we are capable of
providing
predictions r egarding the
total amount of time
a particular
user spends using a particular
process on any given
day
.
We take the elapsed time data associated with each process and create a pivot table of sorts per
process. Each record (each row in the dataframe) is associated with a day when the data for the
process was collected, and the columns of each record are associated with the hour of the day .
Thus, there are 24 columns, labeled 0 to 23, referring to the hours of the day and the time spent
using the process during that hour .
We also have 2
other columns (i.e. the
Total_Usage
and the
Application
) along with 24 mentioned columns. The
Total_Usage
demonstrates how many hours
the app is used during a day , and each
Application
is encoded with a unique numeric identifier ,
which indicates the process being used.
Each record is paired with its respective process in a dictionary . Taking this dataset, we create
several deep-learning models using Keras. The first model attempted is the simple RNN model.
The Sequential model from the Keras package is utilized to create a model with an input layer , a
hidden layer , and a dense layer .
Figur e
: A Simple RNN Model
Later , we go forward to create a more complex model using the LSTM algorithm through Keras.
The LSTM model consisted of Sequential layers, namely two LSTM layers, two Dense layers,
and an output Dense layer .
Figur e
: A LSTM Model
In this particular sample model, the choice is to fit it across 100 epochs as well as the addition of
redundant LSTM and dense layers to allow for a much better performance than the simple RNN.
The model produces a column of continuous predictions regarding the total time spent using a
particular process using the hourly elapsed time. To calculate the accuracy of this model, we
need to create numeric bins to place each prediction into. Specifically , we create 4 dif ferent bins:
[0, 0.01], (0.01, 0.02], (0.02, 0.2], and (0.2, max] based on our data; then we find the True
Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN) to calculate
the accuracy ACC =
.
The accuracy could be improved dramatically if the𝑇𝑃 + 𝑇𝑁𝑇𝑃 + 𝑇𝑁 + 𝐹𝑃 + 𝐹𝑁
binning bounds are shifted such that they are better at accommodating the spread of the data.
5. Results
5.1 HMM
The
accuracy
of
HMM
models
is
calculated
based
on
whether
or
not
the
prediction
falls
in
the
top
n
probabilities
for
that
application.
As
the
value
of
n
(the
number
of
applications)
increases,
the
prediction
accuracy
increases
as
well.
However ,
when
reaching
a
particular
value
of
n
such
as
n
=
10,
the
amount
of
accuracy
increase
starts
to
plateau
and
does
not
fluctuate
much.
Continuing
to
increment
n
won’ t
produce
new
interesting
results
or
help
us
visualize
the
significant
increase
in the transition matrix’ s accuracy . Thus, we conclude the optimal
n
should be
n
= 5 in our case.
Figur e
: Comparisons of the Transition Matrix Performance
on Chrome between 2 Users
Additionally , when comparing the performance of the transition matrix between two users, we
observe that the predictive model works better for user 1 as there are more data collected from
user 1 than from user 2 at the moment we run the HMM model. This also supports the statement
that more data will give us better results.
For more details about how our transition matrices look like, we attach the two figures showing
parts of our results when we set
n = 1
Figur e
: A snippet of the HMM’ s transition matrix for
user 1
As
observed
from
the
matrix,
user
1
has
2.6%,
0.46%,
and
5.06%
chance
of
moving
from
Code.exe
to
ApplicationFrameHost.exe
,
GitHubDesktop.exe
,
and
explor er.exe
respectively .
Figur e
: A snippet of the HMM’ s transition matrix for
user 2
User
2
is
likely
to
enter
explor er.exe
after
mintty .exe
and
msedge.exe
at
14.29%
and
21.05%
chance, according to the above result.
Along with the transition matrix, we implement the emission matrices for both users 1 and 2.
Since the emission matrix relates to the emission of some types of actions, we would interpret
the table below as the following. For example, the likelihood of watching Movies&TV  after
using Chrome of user 1 is around 0.1%, whereas the user would be likely to interact with File
Explorer at 21.28%  after using Chrome.
Figur e
: Results of the HMM’ s emission matrix for user
1
The second user has dif ferent app interaction from user 1. For example, this user would check
their Messenger at 15.50% after using Chrome, and find their documents in File Explorer at
15.25% after Chrome, but they don’ t interact with Movies&TV  (after Chrome) at all.

on user 2
5.2 LSTM/RNN
We provide the readers with a table summarizing some of our experiments as shown below . The
predictions are made on the Chrome app. The train/test ratio is 80/20 without shuf fling when
splitting data to ensure the consecutiveness of the time-series data. (The blue rows show our
experiments for the second LSTM problem statement)

Table
: LSTM/RNN experiments
To sum up, the simple RNN model does not perform with the accuracy that was expected. The
model seems to have trouble understanding the continuous nature of the prediction column,
resulting in low accuracies.Compared to the simple RNN, the LSTM model is more complex and achieves better results. In
particular , the LSTM model can reach an accuracy of more than 60%, sometimes more than
90%, depending on how we divide the bins of our data (for evaluation purposes) and/or how we
determine the threshold dif ference between the predictions and the ground truth values.
a). Pr oblem Statement #1:
Predict the
duration
a user
spends on an app
within an hour
, given
the past time-series data.
After trying dif ferent models and feature engineering techniques, we conclude that the
Bidirectional LSTM provides the best possible result for this problem statement. It can capture
both the peaks and the low values of the time usage. In fact, the bidirectional characteristics
allow the model to learn in both forward and backward directions [17]. Additionally , we can
improve the predictive results by tuning the hyperparameters (i.e. with dif ferent values of nodes
and loss/activation functions). Therefore, to further enhance the accuracy , we can continue doing
cross-validation to find the best possible combination of the hyperparameters as well as
exploring various feature engineering techniques to see if they could help our predictions.
b). Pr oblem Statement #2:
Predict the
total amount of time
a particular user spends using a
particular app on any given
day
.
Regarding the overfitting issue in LSTM problem statement #2, taking into consideration what
we found through the model creation process, we observe: The amount of data that we have
collected has been reduced by a factor of 24 due to our choice to create the pivot tables in the
manner that we did. This makes it impossible to tell if the model is intensely overfitting without
adding more data. Furthermore, we find the idea of shifting around the binning bounds to alter
accuracy calculations to be bad practice. The ability to do so allows us to provide misleading
results if we choose to do so by simply changing the arbitrary partitions we have created of the
data.
Adding to this problem, we find the concept of utilizing 24 hours of usage data to predict the
total daily usage to be a misuse of deep learning to produce predictions. There is a very clear
correlation between the columns of the dataset and the prediction column. When the model is
provided with the proper amounts of data, it will see that the sum of the 24 columns will equal
the 25th column, and the model will begin to overfit.
Because of this, we believe our next steps could be to incorporate other features into the dataset
we are using. Furthermore, adding on a numeric column that associates with the process being
used might be a possible solution, along with any other pertinent numeric features. Another
solution would be to slightly alter our problem statement. Rather than using hourly usage to
predict daily usage, we could potentially use hourly and daily usage distributions as means to
predict the process being used. This would take away the continuous aspect of the prediction
column, turning the problem into a classification problem. Also, this change could help with the
lack of data since the data being used will no longer focus on individual processes at a time and
can focus on the entire dataset we collected.

6. Conclusion
As the two-quarter project comes to an end, we wish to recapitulate what we’ve learned over the
last six months.
Specifically , we have learned and written codes for the input libraries using
Intel’ s Softwar e
Development Kit
. These input libraries act as data
collectors, which allow us to gather
information related to the system usage of a user . With data in our hands, we are able to do Data
Science. In contrast,
“Without Data, ther e is no (Data)
Science”
[18]. In addition, by knowing
how to collect data, we have control over how we want our data to be and what should be
collected to improve the analysis.
During the data acquisition process, we need to ensure data quality (i.e. collecting the desired
measurements that we claim we would collect), flexibility (i.e. considering how to quickly adapt
the collection process to unseen situations), and data privacy (i.e. protecting the personally
identifiable information of the users).
Later , we input the data collected to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis. For EDA, we discover
the “Missing String.” problem and resolve it by imputation. Besides, we observe that Chrome is
the top frequently used app among all applications that both users use. The major reason is that
Chrome allows users to visit other applications/websites quickly; for example, we can enter the
websites of Messenger , Facebook, and Netflix just by using Chrome.
Next, as perceived from the result section, our HMM models are working pretty well with some
accuracies that go beyond 90%. The accuracy is defined by the percentage of correct predicted
probabilities. A prediction is deemed correct if it falls within the top
n (num_apps)
probabilities
predicted. As the value of
n
increases, we receive
a higher accuracy .
Additionally , we develop dif ferent experiments for our LSTM models. The predictive accuracies
are acceptable as the
working
LSTM models are all
giving the accuracies above 50% (i.e. above
the probability of a coin flip), which shows our models’  functionality . Some can reach more than
90%, which seems to be an overfitting problem as we give too much information to the model.
We can further improve our models by (1) considering dif ferent sets of hyperparameters when
tuning our models and (2) re-adjusting our feature engineering process, which allows us to input
other types of features that we are able to extract from the data, and avoid the overfitting /
underfitting problems.
In short, learning how to collect data and input them into dif ferent predictive models helps us
vastly in our journey of becoming Data Scientists. In fact, by understanding where the data
comes from and how the data are generated, we can recognize the informative and useful data
features to feed into our predictive models. This is also what makes us dif ferent from other DataScientists who have not known about data acquisition yet. On the other hand, by observing the
results of predictive models, we can recognize what features should be collected; then we can
come back, re-adjust the input libraries, and generate new data with new features.
In the future, we will continue collecting more data to improve the patterns that can be learned in
our predictive models. By applying this data analysis pipeline, we can infer the sequence of
application usage along with the time used. The analysis will assist us in developing the scripts
that process background tasks, and we can - for example - use the Task Scheduler to pre-launch
the app 2-3 minutes beforehand. That is how we can reduce the initial latency and better user
experience.

Flock Freight - Section A07
Offer Acceptance in the Freight Industry
Keagan Benson, Nima Yazdani, Benson Duong, Radu Manea
Fall Quarter
2022Abstract
Flock Freight is a company that engages with a variety of carriers and shipments, operating as
a marketplace for freight carriers to submit bids on shipping orders that need to be fulfilled,
a function commonly referred to as a ""freight broker."" Other companies remunerate Flock
Freight to transport their shipments, which are subsequently outsourced to freight carriers.
The company often encounters complications related to the bid acceptance procedure. Some
shipment orders receive multiple offers, and minimizing the cost of orders is crucial to the
enterprise since it maximizes profits.
The objective of this project is to present a machine learning technique that will establish
the optimal stopping point for the acceptance and reneging of delivery offers by carriers for
Flock Freight’s orders. Time is a valuable resource, and any time spent being indecisive implies
alossofcarrierclients. Therefore, itiscriticaltoprovideamodelandprocessthatisdependable
and scalable to Flock Freight’s requirements.
1 Introduction
1.1 Background
Flock Freight operates as an intermediary within the shipping industry, serving as a trusted
""freight broker"" for both shipping carriers and shippers. The company specializes in facilitating
the transportation of freight across the country by connecting multiple shippers’ loads with a
carrier as a ""pool"" in what is known as a ""Shared-Truckload"" (STL). Shippers provide Flock
Freight with orders, which carriers then bid on to secure the load. Flock Freight ultimately
decides which carrier to hire for a specific order and pays them to deliver the shipment.
The decision-making process of accepting or rejecting a carrier’s bid can be quite complex,
as the goal is to maximize margin while being mindful of potential future offers that may yield
better results. Moreover, the consideration of STLs adds another layer of complication, as new
orders may arise that can be combined with existing ones after a carrier has already been chosen
for the original order.
Optimizing the acceptance of bids is crucial for increasing margins and reducing costs. To
achieve this, Flock Freight leverages information on current and historical orders and associated
bids to develop a model that follows the optimal stopping problem. This model takes into
account contextual factors surrounding bid reception, as well as order details, to predict the
optimal bid price.
1.2 Review of Prior Work
Flock Freight operates as an intermediary in the shipping industry, providing a platform that
connects shipping carriers and shippers for the purpose of transporting freight across the coun-
try. As a ""freight broker,"" Flock Freight acts as a trusted intermediary that specializes inconnecting multiple shippers’ loads with a carrier as a ""pool"" through what is known as a
""Shared-Truckload"" (STL).
To accomplish this, Flock Freight receives orders from shippers, which carriers will bid on to
take the load. Flock Freight then decides which offer to accept for a certain order and pays the
carrier to deliver the shipment. However, the decision to accept or reject a carrier’s offer can
be challenging, as it requires balancing the goal of maximizing margins with the uncertainty of
future offers that may be more profitable.
Previousworkontheoptimalstoppingproblemhasshownthatthisisacommonissueacross
industries and contexts. For instance, a well-known scenario is the secretary problem, in which
an administrator seeks to hire the best secretary out of ""n"" applicants for the position. The
administrator must make a decision immediately following each interview and can only gather
information from previously interviewed candidates. The 1/e stopping rule is commonly used to
solve this problem, where e is the base of natural logarithms. Applying this rule to the scenario
above, if we have 10 randomly selected applicants, we’d interview the first 10/e applicants and
record the best applicant. We’d then interview the remaining applicants stopping at the first
applicant who beats our recorded “best applicant”. If we never find a better applicant and are
interviewing the last applicant, we must select the final offer.
Applying this concept to freight brokering, the ""applicants"" are the offers received from
carriers for a particular order. However, the number of offers for a given order is unknown,
making it challenging to apply the secretary approach without first building a model to predict
the number of offers. We must create a model determining what we classify as a good offer
based on historical offer data. This metric for what a good and bad offer is must also take into
consideration the variation of offer costs and the number of expected future offers, which both
require their own sub-models.Ultimately, the goal is to develop an optimal approach to offer
acceptance that maximizes margins while reducing costs.
1.3 Data Description
The full dataset includes 2 tables which contain: A) the orders, and descriptive information
about it (Order Time, Pickup Deadline, accommodating conditions for its mode of delivery such
as transport mode, refrigeration, and hazardness, etc); B) The offers by carriers to deliver said
orders - this would be a many-to-one relationship, with the reference number column (assuming
it’s a singleton list) being the foreign key. The offers table includes mostly information such as
the rate of the offer, whether it is pooled or not, whether it was selected, and whether it was
uncovered. We also created a supplemental dataset that maps 3 digit zip code identifiers to
latitude and longitude coordinates.Table 1: Orders Data Dictionary

2 Methods
2.1 Exploratory Data Analysis
2.1.1 Geospatial Analysis
An automated python script first uses BeautifulSoup to web scrape from a government census
website to download the latest 2020 census shapefile for zip code tabulation areas, (which
is a geospatial data frame that maps each zip code to geographic polygonal areas) for datapreparation with geopandas; Geopandas will be used to reproject the shapefile to pseudo-
mercator. The original data only provides the first 3 (zero padded) digits identifier of the
zip codes, whereas the shapefile zip codes are 5 digits; for this reason, the 5-digit zip code
column had its 2 last trailing digits dropped (making it usable as a one-to-one foreign key),
and Dissolve (a spatial group-by operation in Geopandas) was used to group up the zip code
areas into unified polygons. The centroids of each zip code tabulation area will represent the
x, y coordinates.
To verify this geospatial data preparation actually produced accurate results, we calcu-
lated the euclidean distances between the new x/y coordinates of the destinations and origins,
and plotted them against the pre-existing column “Approximate Driving Route Mileage”; the
resulting scatterplot is a nearly perfect straight diagonal line, attesting that it is reliable.
By plotting the orders in terms of their origin and destination zip codes, most scatter plots
only show a population bias. The eastern half of the US tends to be more heavily populated
than the western half. This makes sense since population centers tend to be logistic hubs, but
is otherwise not useful.The2followingplotsshowascatterplotofzipcodenodescoloredaccordingtotheloggedaverage
amount of offers they see per order, (done for origin zipcodes and destination zipcodes).The next 2 plots are binarized versions (above or below the median) of the earlier 2, to make
contrast easier to see.
* Clearly, the eastern half of the US and the urban west coast has higher population density,
and there is an equal balance of both high and low offer amounts. So utilizing geographic
features for these regions for offer amount prediction might not be helpful.
* Orders with an origin zipcode in the Southwest seem to have seem to have a mostly low
(below-average) offer amount.
* Orders with an origin zipcode in Florida seem to have a confidently high (above-average)
offer amount.The 2 following plots also try to visualize logged average amount of offers per order, but now
it’s for shipping routes instead of Nodes. The plot is too difficult to see any differences, so the
2nd plot binarizes the values (below or above the median).The network of connections between the origins and destinations for orders is also plotted;
Side note: some zip code nodes seem fully isolated, but they do in fact have a link ; the links
are just at a very low opacity (0.1). What this can mean: Paths with origin / destination zip
code nodes that are connected to the cities, will have more orders. In addition, the area in what
seems to be between the Upper South and Mid Atlantic have noticeable activity with orders.
Shipping between Los Angeles and New York is also very heavy. This could be useful in our
prediction model for number of offers.This last figure (Shipping Paths by Log(Rate USD)) shows that several shipping corridors are
cheaper than others. These include most deliveries entering and exiting Florida (From Chicago
to Florida? And Dallas to Chicago?), and deliveries along the west coast between Southern
California to Seattle.We also tried to use unsupervised ML, specifically grouping the zipcodes into clusters. This
was done by applying K-means clustering (N=20) onto 3 columns: the zipcode’s X and Y
coordinates, and a 3rd dimension to symbolize density (We went with the number of offers seen
per zipcode), allowing the clustering procedure to extract metropolitan areas. This is going
to be used as a way to one-hot-encode the zipcodes as generalized metropolitan clusters, 20
columns rather than hundreds of zipcodes.2.1.2 Time Data Analysis
When comparing the metrics of different business days, it was found that Thursday had
unusual statistical significance in having the cheapest of rates (relative to the other offers for
an order). In other words, we logged the RATE USD column of the joined tables, then z-scored
it (not in terms of the whole table, but to each group of offers per order), then binarized it so
that being >= 0 means above-average (since z-scoring re-centers the mean at 0), and in doing
so, found that Thursday has the lowest percentage of above-average offer rates compared to
other business days; even with further hypothesis testing (Chi-Square, T-Testing ), Thursday
continues to pop up as statistically significant. If we put the 2 last columns of the table
below through a chi-square hypothesis test, the resulting p-value is 0.0010375. This could be a
promising area of potential use for future modeling.
2.1.3 Lead Time Data Analysis
The number of offers an order receives depends on how long into the lead time the order had
been when an offer was accepted. Lead time is the difference in time between when an order is
placed and when it needs to be picked up. When Flock accepts the offer early in the lead time,
it does not accurately reflect the number of offers the order will receive as well as if the order
was accepted later into the lead time. When looking at the violin graph, the earlier into the
lead time (0-25%), the number of offers are a lot lower than later into the lead time (75-100%).
We can use this information to weight our samples when we train the estimating number of
offers model.2.2 The Secretary Method
Secretary Method Outcomes - The following analysis shows that using the raw secretary ap-
proach by itself is still a very reliable method: There should be 3 types of outcomes of the
secretary method: 1) Match - the method happens to land exactly on the best offer; 2) un-
dershoot - the method stops on an offer better than anything before the 1/e mark, but is not
in fact the best one yet; 3) Overshooting - the method had long passed the best offer already-
meaning the best offer was actually before the 1/e mark, and the method has no choice but
to stop on the last offer, regardless if that last offer is good or bad; Overshooting is the worst
outcome; As seen by this barplot for the secretary method, there’s a 0.8 chance that either a
perfect match or undershooting occurs; While undershooting is not as good as a match, it’s a
far better position to be in than overshooting - so this is still a good deal.3 Model
Our Offer Acceptance model comprises of 3 sub-models. They are prediction models that take
in the data of an order, and outputs 3 columns representing the average rate of an order, the
standard deviation of said average rate of an order, and the number of offers the order gets.
These 3 columns are the features of the final model that classifies whether or not an incoming
offer for an order is acceptable or not.
* This model setup also has the benefit of letting you adjust the range of tolerance for the
threshold (without needing to retrain the model) by multiplying the standard deviation with
some positive constant.
* The column for the predicted amount of offers allows more carefulness when rejecting
offer: if the amount is high, we are free to gamble with rejecting incoming offers until we get
one that is below the threshold.
The Number of Offers sub-model uses order characteristics such as estimated cost, pickup
and drop off location, distance apart, size of load and truck requirements to predict the number
of offers that order will receive. We can use lead-time for sample-weight adjustment during the
training. This will allow the model to use weight the samples higher that were accepted later
into the lead time.
The Rate Average Model uses linear regression and is very accurate at 85% to 90%. The
Rate Standard Deviation model performed poorly when any sort of regression method was used,
so the model task was re-simplified as ordinal classification for the time being: the standard
deviation is now split in tiers, and the tier cut-off values serve as the ""standard deviations"".
For example, if the value 0.3 splits the observed distribution standard deviation in the
training set into 50%-50% (i.e. median), then stdev’s in the range 0 <= x <= 0.3 are labeled
Low and represented by 0. And those 0.3 <= x <= inf are labeled High and represented by
0.3.Both the Rate Average Model and Rate Standard Deviation model mostly uses the same
features, with closely identical input data frames. The features are only allowed to come from
the orders dataset.
4 Results
Our resulting offer acceptance model consists of a classifier which determines whether an offer
is a good offer. We classified good offers as offers which flock freight accepted and the offers
which had the lowest cost of their order.The features the logistic regression model was trained
on were the offer rate and the outputs of the sub models, the estimated number of offers, the
estimated cost, and the estimated standard deviation. Our model was able to select offers with
an average price 4.44% lower than what Flock Freight had selected!
5 Discussion
While the aim was to develop a model that accepts lower-cost offers compared to those histor-
ically accepted by Flock Freight, the findings demonstrate that there is considerable room for
improvement. The constraints imposed by the secretary method do not entirely align with the
real-world problem under consideration. For instance, the inability to reconsider a previously
""rejected"" offer in our model does not accurately represent the decision-making process in a
real-world scenario, where multiple offers can be assessed simultaneously.
Furthermore, the introduction of STLs plays a crucial role in offer acceptance, which has
not been accounted for in the final models. Future work should explore the possibility of
incorporating pooling, as well as refining the estimation of costs by incorporating and extending
geographical features identified in the EDA. The same applies to predicting the number of offers
received.
It is important to reevaluate the sub-models of our pipeline and consider whether other
models and features could contribute to more accurate classifications. Additionally, the predic-
tion of the number of offers received should be revisited to account for potential future offers
that may have been prematurely disregarded. Although these questions were addressed during
the model’s development, the answers obtained highlight the need for further refinement, re-
framing of the problem, and abandoning the base secretary method in favor of a purely trained
model approach. Enhancements can be made by improving the prediction of a ""good offer""
basis and refining the prediction of the number of offers and the variation in price for an order.6 References

to
combine
less-than-truckload
shipments
into
one
truckload
to
improve
efficiency
and
reduce
potential
costs.
As
a
method
of
minimizing
shipping
costs,
Flock
Freight
puts
customers'
orders
to
an
auction
so
that
freight
companies
compete
with
each
other
to
ship
orders
at
lower
rates
–
the
company
needs
to
accept
a
good
offer
befor e
the
freight
company
withdraws
the
offer.
The
resear ch
team
wants
to

that
identifies
offers
with
the
best

befor e
it

or

The
team
suggests
a
two-part
hybrid
model
that
consists
of
a
regression
model
that
predicts
minimum

rates
and
a

model
that

The

Introduction
Flock
Freight
is
a
logistics
firm
that
endeavors
to
transform
the
freight
industry
by
promoting
shared
truckloads,
leading
to
decreased
costs
and
carbon
emissions
in
national
freight
shipping.
The
firm
functions
as
an
intermediary
to
connect
customers
with
shipping
companies,
enabling
a
single
truck
to
transport
multiple
deliveries
from
one
region
A
to
B
in
one
trip.
To
pool
multiple
goods
in
a
single
truck,
Flock
Freight
accepts
offers
from
shipping
companies
such
that
a
single
offer
can
be
made
on
multiple
orders
Flock
Freight’ s
customers
seek
to
have
delivered
by
a
particular
deadline.
The
firm
selects
the
lowest
offer
rate
for
each
order
from
the
various
offers
it
receives
from
different
shipping
companies.
However ,
this
process
is
complicated
by
the
possibility
of
offers
expiring
abruptly ,
as
truckers
may
divert
their
attention
to
other
shipping
platforms.
Thus,
the
data
science
team
at
Flock
Freight
must
develop
a
machine
learning
model
that can swiftly identify the optimal of fer as soon as it is made to tackle this challenge.
The
secretary
problem,
a
well-known
optimal
stopping
problem
in
applied
statistics,
shares
similarities
with
Flock
Freight’ s
challenge.
In
the
secretary
problem,
the
goal
is
to
hire
the
best
candidate
from
a
pool
of
candidates
without
the
ability
to
revisit
previously
rejected
candidates.
Upon
extensive
research,
statisticians
have
proven
that
the
probability
of
choosing
the
best
candidate
is
maximized
when
you
choose
the
first
candidate
to
beat
the
first
37%
of
allcandidates
you
interviewed.
However ,
due
to
the
fact
that
most
orders
at
Flock
Freight
receive
only
a
handful
of
offers,
the
secretary
method
performs
worse
than
the
algorithm
already
in
place:
the
firm’ s
machine
learning
model
is
better
at
choosing
the
best
offer
than
the
secretary
method
is.
The
firm
does
not
know
exactly
how
many
offers
each
order
will
receive,
and
offer
rates
are
subject
to
change
based
on
delivery
urgency .
Moreover ,
the
secretary
method
generalizes
all
cases
of
optimal
stopping
problems
and
fails
to
leverage
the
rich
dataset
available
to
Flock
Freight.
Thus,
an
algorithm
as
complex
as
Flock
Freight’ s
situation
needs
to
be
developed.
Flock
Freight
has
access
to
two
primary
datasets
that
provide
dense
information:
order
and
offer.
The
order
dataset
contains
essential
information
about
an
order ,
including
the
shipping
distance,
time,
location,
freight
size,
and
hazard
level.
The
geographic
data
within
this
dataset
plays
a
pivotal
role
in
revealing
the
presence
of
traffic
infrastructure
that
incentivizes
trucking
companies
to
pool
multiple
orders
in
a
single
truck.
Furthermore,
the
time
data
helps
Flock
Freight
understand
how
much
time
the
firm
has
before
it
is
desperate
to
take
any
offer.
The
offer
dataset
stores
information
on
all
offers
made
to
Flock
Freight,
regardless
of
whether
the
offer
was
accepted
or
successfully
delivered.
Each
offer
instance
includes
a
QUOTE_TYPE
attribute
that
denotes
the
type
of
delivery
a
shipping
company
offers,
namely
a
pool
or
a
quote
.
The
pooled
truckload
(PTL)
aims
to
share
a
truck
among
multiple
orders,
while
the
full
truckload
(FTL) dedicates one truck to fulfill a single order .
One
critical
aspect
to
note
about
the
data
is
that
the
Flock
Freight
dataset
is
not
able
to
capture
the
entire
nature
of
the
bidding
process.
To
serve
its
customers,
Flock
Freight
cannot
wait
to
receive
all
the
offers
an
order
could
ever
get
because
the
company
cannot
wait
until
the
pickup
deadline
approaches
without
choosing
an
offer.
That
is,
the
data
lacks
the
true
number
of
offers
and the true lowest of fer rates which freight companies are willing to provide.
As
a
solution
to
this
problem,
the
team
builds
a
hybrid
model
that
consists
of
an
XGB
Regression
model
that
predicts
the
minimum
offer
rate
each
order
will
receive
and
a
Decision
Tree
model
that
predicts
the
number
of
offers
each
order
will
receive.
Together ,
theXGB
classifier
hybrid
model achieves a 0.79 accuracy is identifying best of fers.
An XGB Regr ession model and Decision T ree model ar e used to estimate the minimum offer rate
and the total number of offers an or der will r eceive. T ogether , they power an XGB Classification
model that identifies best offers.
2.
Data Cleaning and EDA
These
two
datasets
consist
of
707,418
offers
and
280,906
orders.
The
order
dataset
includes
the
order
date,
origin
and
destination
zipcodes,
route
mileage,
and
shipping
preferences.
The
order
date
is
the
date
on
which
the
shipper
placed
the
order .
The
origin
and
destination
zipcodes
indicate
the
starting
and
ending
points
of
the
shipment.
The
route
mileage
is
the
distance
between
the
origin
and
destination
zipcodes.
The
shipping
preferences
may
involve
specific
requirements
such
as
temperature
control
or
hazardous
materials
transportation.
The
offer
dataset
includes
the
offer
date,
rate,
and
type.
The
offer
date
is
the
date
on
which
the
carrier
made
the
offer.
The
offer
rate
refers
to
the
dollar
amount
the
carrier
is
willing
to
be
paid
to
ship
an
order .
There
are
two
types
of
offers:
Full
Truckload
(FTL)
and
Partial
Truckload
(PTL).
FTL
shipping
is
a
method
in
which
a
single
order
occupies
an
entire
truck.
FTL
shipping
is
generally
used
for
large
and
hazardous
shipments.
PTL
is
a
method
in
which
multiple
orders
share
a
truck.
PTL
shipping
is
typically
less
expensive
since
the
customer
only
pays
for
the
space
used
rather
than
the
entire
truck.
Despite
the
wealth
of
information
contained
within
those
datasets
provided
by
Flock
Freight,
some
limitations
make
analysis
and
modeling
difficult
due
to
data
privacy
concerns.
One
of
the
primary
issues
is
that
the
origin
and
destination
features
only
include
3-digit
zipcodes
because
Flock
Freight
needs
to
anonymize
its
customer
data,
making
it
challenging
to
work
with
and
limiting
the
accuracy
of
geographic
analyses.
Another
limitation
is
the
fact
that
Flock
Freight
cannot
keep
track
of
all
offers
that
could
have
possibly
been
made
on
an
order
as
doing
so
will
risk
the
company
to
let
offers
expire.
This
means
that
the
company
is
unable
to
collect
accurate
data
on
the
actual
number
of
offers
and
the
lowest
offer
rate
each
order
could
have
received.
The
lack
of
access
to
the
true
data
makes
our
research
team
difficult
to
develop
a
model
that
accurately reflects the true nature of of fers in the freight delivery industry .
Building
a
model
that
correctly
identifies
the
best
offer
for
each
order
requires
the
model
to
learn
well
from
numeric
data,
including
offer
rates
for
orders
and
the
number
of
offers
each
order
receives. To ensure data quality , anomaly detection was executed to remove outliers.Distribution of major numeric data befor e removing anomalies.
The
red
dots
in
the
figure
above
represent
outliers
outside
the
0.01
and
99.9
percentiles,
whereas
the
whiskers
represent
+/-
2.5
z-scores.
As
seen,
there
are
a
handful
of
offer
rates
that
do
not
lie
in
the
normal
range.
Moreover ,
multiple
orders
received
an
extremely
large
number
of
orders
compared
to
others,
so
the
scale
had
to
be
represented
in
terms
of
logs.
As
such,
outliers
beyond
the +/- 2.5 z-score range were removed.

Red lines r epresent per centiles.
The
new
dataset
with
outliers
removed
shows
a
more
expected
distribution
of
numeric
data.
A
notable
distribution
is
the
number
of
offers
each
order
receives
–
over
25%
of
all
orders
receive
two
or
fewer
orders.
The
small
number
of
orders
received
from
truckers
may
indicate
that
Flock
Freight
might
accept
offers
too
early
from
freight
companies,
disallowing
the
company
to
collect
more
data
on
the
actual
number
of
offers
each
order
could
have
received.
That
is,
before
the
company
could
count
the
true
number
of
offers
each
order
will
receive
until
its
pickup
deadline,
Flock Freight may be accepting early of fers, preventing the accumulation of richer , accurate data.

by the week.
by the week.
A
simple
time
analysis
was
done
to
explore
how
offers
change
throughout
the
year.
As
expected,
the
number
of
offers
dropped
significantly
in
the
last
few
weeks
of
the
year.
Surprisingly ,
however ,
the
best
offer
values
dropped
in
the
final
weeks,
suggesting
that
the
holiday
season
may
not drive up freight delivery costs.
Another
important
feature
the
best-of fer-identifier
model
must
learn
is
categorical
information
about
the
origins
and
destinations
of
orders.
Before
analyzing
the
geolocation
data,
however ,
the
team
first
had
to
convert
the
3-digit
categorical
zipcodes
to
numerical
coordinate
data.
Then,
the
team
paired
the
origin
coordinates
with
the
destination
coordinates
to
plot
a
map
of
where
the
most popular routes are.
Map data show dubious tr ends in or ders that could help train models.
The
first
map
shows
the
popular
routes
by
their
percentage
share
of
all
the
orders
placed
to
Flock
Freight.
The
second
map
shows
how
many
orders
each
of
the
top
20%
popular
routes
receive.
The
third
map
shows
that
there
is
no
difference
in
rate
dollar
per
route
mileage
–
no
popular
routes
seem
to
be
less
desirable
by
truckers.
Although
the
team
believes
that
the
coordinate
data
can
reveal
important
information
about
which
routes
receive
more
offers
and
better
offers,
the
team
was
concerned
that
working
with
numerical
coordinate
data
may
not
be
the
best
option
when
it
comes
to
training
a
model.
Thus,
the
team
ran
a
clustering
algorithm
to
cluster
each
of
the origin and destination coordinates into groups.
The origin and destination coor dinates ar e grouped into 10 r egions.
Each
order
can
receive
an
unlimited
number
of
offers,
meaning
that
carriers
can
initially
ask
for
an
extremely
high
price
and
then
settle
for
a
more
reasonable
price.
The
team
was
curious
to
know what the distribution of of fers for each order looks like.
The first r ed line r epresents the 50th per centile, the second line the 98th per centile.
As
expected,
more
than
50
percent
of
the
orders
have
standard
deviation
values
of
over
200,
suggesting
that
the
gap
between
the
initial
and
final
offers
is
extreme.
The
following
plot
was
created
to
investigate
further
how
these
price
drops
look
against
the
number
of
offers
each
order
receives.
Orders that r eceive mor e offers have wider gaps between initial and final offer amounts.
As
expected,
orders
that
receive
more
offers
have
greater
price
drops
since
the
initial
offer.
This
analysis
suggests
that,
to
accurately
predict
the
final
offer
rate,
it
is
important
to
know
how
many
offers
an
order
will
receive.
That
is,
before
building
a
model
that
identifies
the
best
offer
for
each
order , it is important to build a model that guesses the number of of fers an order will receive.
3.
Methods
By
recognizing
that
the
secretary
method
is
not
a
viable
solution
for
selecting
the
optimal
shipping
offer,
Flock
Freight
embarked
on
developing
a
machine
learning
model
specifically
tailored
to
their
unique
problem.
The
model
is
designed
to
identify
the
optimized
offer
for
each
order
based
on
two
key
components:
the
number
of
offers
and
the
expected
minimum
offer
rates.
To
achieve
this
goal,
the
research
team
developed
a
hybrid
classification
model
that
combines
predictions from the two models to select the of fer with the lowest cost.
The
first
component
of
the
model
involved
predicting
the
number
of
offers
each
order
would
receive,
accomplished
through
a
classification
model.
This
model
generated
a
column
labeled
PREDICTED_OFFER_COUNT .
After
conducting
a
thorough
model
selection
process,
which
included
Ridge,
Lasso,
XGBoost,
and
Decision
Tree
models,
the
team
found
that
the
Decision
Tree
Classifier
outperformed
the
other
models
–
while
the
Decision
Tree
has
an
MSE
score
of
7.05,
Ridge
Regression
is
at
11.51,
Lasso
Regression
at
12.18,
and
XGBoost
Regressor
at
9.32.
Hyper
parameter
tuning
reveals
that
the
Decision
Tree’s
MSE
can
go
down
to
5.49
with
the
following values: max_depth = 40; min_samples_leaf = 2; min_samples_split = 2.
Decision T ree performs best at estimating the number of offers an or der will r eceive.
For
the
second
part
of
the
model,
the
team
developed
a
regression
model
to
predict
the
lowest
offer
rate
each
order
will
receive.
This
model
generated
a
column
labeled
PREDICTED_MIN_RA TE.
The
team
conducted
a
similar
model
selection
process,
which
included
Ridge,
Lasso,
Bayesian,
and
XGBoost
models,
and
ultimately
found
that
the
XGBoost
Regressor
takes
a
significant
lead
with
its
MSE
score
at
183895.2,
compared
to
Ridge
Regression’ s
1400435.74,
Lasso
Regression’ s
1400173.5295965234,
and
Bayesian
Regression’ s
1400432.6838781652.
Upon
tuning
the
XGBoost
Regressor
(max_depth
=
10,
n_estimators
=
500, reg_alpha = 1, reg_lambda = 1), the team lowered the MSE score to 87619.44.
XGBoost Regr essor significantly outperforms other models.
Finally ,
the
team
leveraged
the
two
previous
models’
PREDICTED_MIN_RA TE
and
PREDICTED_OFFER_COUNT
outputs
to
create
the
hybrid
classification
model
for
identifying
the
best
offer.
This
model
underwent
a
similar
selection
process
that
included
Logistic
Regression
(0.70
accuracy),
Decision
Tree
(0.71
accuracy),
and
XGBoost
(0.78
accuracy).
With
a
maximum
depth
of
10,
500
estimators,
and
regularization
parameters
(reg_alpha
=
1
and
reg_lambda = 1), the accuracy score rises to 0.79.
XGB Classifier mar ginally performs better than Decision T ree and Logistic Regr ession.

Results
Performance metrics show that the hybrid model is an impr ovement fr om the existing Flock
Freight model and that the hybrid model is fr ee from bias accor ding to Sensitivity and Specificity .
The
evaluation
of
the
hybrid
model
entailed
determining
its
ability
to
identify
the
best
offer
accurately .
The
model’ s
accuracy ,
quantified
by
the
proportion
of
correctly
identified
minimum
offer
rates,
was
found
to
be
0.559,
which
surpassed
the
performance
of
Flock
Freight’ s
previous
model,
which
had
an
accuracy
of
0.517.
Furthermore,
the
sensitivity ,
which
is
the
proportion
of
actual
minimum
offer
rates
our
model
correctly
identified,
was
about
81.4%.
The
specificity ,
which
is
the
proportion
of
actual
non-minimum
offer
rates
that
the
model
correctly
identified,
was approximately 71.8%.
The shipping distance, number of hours between or der placement and pickup deadline, and the
length of the fr eight ar e the thr ee most important factors when pr edicting the number of offers an
order will r eceive.
The curr ent offer rate is the most important featur e for estimating the minimum offer rate for
orders.
The number of offers an or der is expected to r eceive, the number of offers the or der has r eceived
so far , and the minimum offer rate the or der is expected to r eceive ar e the most important
featur es when identifying offers with best rates.
The
hybrid
model
outperformed
the
previous
model
used
by
Flock
Freight
in
terms
of
accuracy .
Additionally ,
the
sensitivity
and
specificity
metrics
suggest
that
our
model
can
correctly
identify
both
minimum
and
non-minimum
offer
rates,
proving
the
model’ s
effectiveness
in
real-world
scenarios.

Discussion
In
conclusion,
the
research
team’ s
development
of
a
machine
learning
model
has
proven
to
be
successful.
The
hybrid
classification
model,
which
incorporates
predictions
from
two
separate
models
to
identify
the
optimized
offer
for
each
order
based
on
the
number
of
offers
and
the
minimum
offer
rates,
has
demonstrated
its
ability
to
determine
the
best
offer
accurately .
This
model
could
assist
Flock
Freight
in
making
informed
decisions
and
reducing
overall
shipping
costs.
However ,
it
is
essential
to
note
that
the
model
still
contains
a
limitation.
The
datasets
used
for
model
training
and
evaluation
are
based
on
Flock
Freight’ s
previous
historical
data.
Therefore,
the
model’ s
ability
to
generalize
to
new
and
unfamiliar
conditions
outside
the
historical
data
is
uncertain.
A
potential
approach
for
further
research
is
to
conduct
a
longitudinal
study ,
collecting
data
over
the
years.
It
would
provide
a
more
comprehensive
understanding
of
the
model’ s
performance
under
various
conditions.
Moreover ,
a
Reinforcement
Learning
Model
could
guide
the
computer
to
learn
when
to
accept
and
decline
offers,
although
defining
the
reward function still remains a mystery .","The freight industry has become critical during the COVID-19 pandemic, and Flock Freight aims to revolutionize it by providing cost-effective shipping methods. They use machine learning algorithms to combine shipments and put orders to auction for lower rates. The research team proposes a hybrid model consisting of regression and classification models to identify the best offers. They clean and analyze the data, finding trends in offers and orders. The hybrid model outperforms the existing model in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. However, further research is needed to test the model's generalization to new conditions."

In order to provide insight on the opportunity for energy usage andcost optimization, we used energy data from a building on UCSD’s campus and auxiliary informationabout UCSD’s pricing model for energy to build a model that predicts future energy spending andattempted reducing predicted energy spending by controlling two user-set variables.IntroductionOptimizing and reducing energy usage is one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century in regards toclimate change and rising costs of power. However, this challenge of optimization and frugality is notelementary. Many factors can change how much energy the same device uses - the time of day, climatetrends (which inform heating needs), policy changes that limit energy in specific seasons, and more.Therefore, creating a model that takes into account all these variables and utilizes specific energy sensorsavailable to UC San Diego’s researchers to compute energy uses and costs would give users crucialinformation to plan energy usage long into the future. Our goal in the project is to use energy data from abuilding on UCSD’s campus and auxiliary information about energy costs to build a model to predictfuture energy spending.Literature ReviewOur work in this project is based on our mentor, Rajesh Gupta, and his work on the Brick schema1. TheBRICK schema was developed by industry and academic leaders aiming to standardize buildingmetadata. To capture the development process and details of this venture, the researchers published anin-depth scientific paper alongside the Brick schema itself. Titled “Brick: Metadata schema for portablesmart building applications”2, this article goes intogreat detail about both the vast applications of thisproject and the functions enabling it to be flexible yet specific. In this research, the creators first explainhow many buildings, especially commercial ones, demand a staggering amount of energy for operations.However, much of this demanded power is not properly utilized, with an estimated 30% of all energybeing wasted. Losing out on this much power is a major financial and environmental loss, though such atravesty can be remedied by converting these large buildings into so-called smart buildings. Byconnecting all of the building functions via an internet connection, operations that would normallyactivate numerous appliances can now save energy by only activating the useful ones. Though thebenefits are obvious, conversion to smart buildings is nevertheless painfully slow, primarily becausebuilding appliance metadata is neither standardized nor machine-readable.This major issue is what the Brick schema aims to resolve. By converting building-specific termswith a normalized list of domain terms, machine-readable relationships can be made between buildingsubsystems. These relationships are further established through the setting of classes and hierarchies. Forexample, sensors can be encapsulated by corresponding devices which themselves are encapsulated bybroad systems. These relationships can then be used to activate and adjust even the most minute processeswith ease via SPARQL queries. While Brick is not the first project to tackle metadata standardization, thepaper elaborates on how it beats competitors such as IFC and Haystack in both vocabulary andapplication requirements. To put their project to the test, the researchers applied the Brick schema toHVAC processes in six buildings. Constructed in different locations and during different periods, thesebuildings put the flexibility of Brick to the test. While some of the older buildings provided a fewchallenges to overcome, nevertheless Brick was able to be successfully implemented in each location.Though the system and work behind Brick are highly utilizable, some areas could be expandedupon. Firstly, effective use of Brick requires energy usage information to be known, yet methods to accessit are not inherent to Brick. Perhaps there could be a way to package this information alongside the Brickfile. Also, Brick does not include real locational information that would allow operators to make informeddecisions. Maybe such a quality can be implemented in future ventures so energy usage can be betteroptimized. Any implementation of Brick will likely be paired with these two types of information,including our initially planned usage of Brick in this paper.DataPrimary Data & ChallengesIdeally in our project, we would have obtained the most recent HVAC data possible for our desiredbuilding. At UCSD, we would have done this by pairing sensor data with a Brick schema mapping for thebuilding in order to query relevant sensors for our calculations, then used UCSD's Brick server to pull thedata. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain access to the Brick server because of data access issues tothe Brickserver on campus that affected the four of us, as well as our mentors Rajesh Gupta and XiaohanFu.Thus, we relied on a data pull from a previous project: Hsin-Yu Liu’s Batch ReinforcementLearning dataset3for the EBU-3B (Computer Science)building. This data represents 15 rooms worth ofdata on floors 2, 3, and 4 of the building with data spanning from July 2017 to early January 2019.Because of this data’s original purpose for batch reinforcement learning, we found that several elementsof the data were not conducive to the type of project we created.Firstly and perhaps most importantly, the 15 rooms in this dataset are un-labeled. There is asecondary index that may hint at which room each of the data points belong to. However, when we triedto use these secondary index values as a basis for the rooms, we found that enough of the data points wereambiguous that it was unclear how much room values would actually help with our model. We also askedthe owner of the dataset for the room values - they were not kept. Re-obtaining them would also involveusing the Brick server that we cannot obtain access to. This means that our model had to handle data thathad multiple different energy variables for the same timestamp and other variables.Another issue with the dataset was that the dataset was designed to have the same amount of datapoints per room, but was not locked into representing the same window of time. Some rooms’ data coverJuly 2017-January 2018, while others cover May 2018-January 2019, and other rooms all manner ofwindows in between. If there was missing data for a room, the time range of data covered by that roomwas just extended until the number of data points was even. This creates significant missingness in thedata that we had to handle.Finally, the data points were intended to be recorded at regular 5 minute intervals - the data doesnot match exact 5 minute intervals. The data points range between half a minute to 4 and a half minutesfrom the timestamp away from the timestamp that represents an even 5 minutes that they were supposedto represent (discounting timestamps that are entirely missing from the data). Predictions are easier withregular windows, so that was an additional challenge for us to tackle.Cost DataAside from our primary dataset, we collected another dataset that we included in our model. The data thatwe conclusively will incorporate comes from Keaton Chia of UCSD’s DERConnect4team surroundingUCSD’s energy pricing for energy generated by UCSD [1].
Figure 1: UCSD’s energy pricing plan for fiscal years 2017/2018 - 2026/2027UCSD technically uses two sets of rates for the price of electricity - UCSD’s rates and San DiegoGas and Electric’s (SDGE) rates. We were unable to obtain information about when UCSD used its ratesand when it used SDGE’s rates, so for consistency for our analysis, we chose to stick exclusively toUCSD’s rate values. Our cost estimates for energy usage will likely act as underestimates since it is likelythat SDGE’s rates are higher because it acts as an outside supplier. That being said, we believe because ofthe ambiguity, it made the most sense to use the UCSD data because it requires less domain knowledge tounderstand and reflects a future where UCSD aims to generate more of its own energy.Because all of our data comes from fiscal years FY17/18 and FY18/19, we used the electricityvalues $0.07 and $0.08 as a transformation for energy values to get the cost values we used in the finalprediction. We had to estimate when UCSD’s change of the fiscal years and quarters was, as the valuesvary by department5and we did not know for sure whichfiscal close date was correct for this scenario.We ended up using June 30th as the annual cutoff date.MethodsData CleaningAs a result of the issues with the dataset that we ran into, we performed several steps to try and addressthem before performing the cost transformation:
1.We separated our data into training and testing sets based on dates in the original dataset, whereapproximately 70% of the data is before August 1, 2018 and the rest is August 1, 2018 andonwards.2.We floored timestamps (with the Pandas Timestamp floor function) in the dataset to the nearesthour. The main goal of this step was to handle the irregularity of the timestamps by ensuring thattimestamps were in regular intervals. We also wanted to ensure that there were more data pointsin each bucket for our next step.3.We used medians to aggregate data from each floored timestamp into buckets for the training andtesting dataset separately. Since the energy values range a lot as a result of the 15 unidentifiedrooms in the dataset, medians were chosen over means because they would be less susceptible tounlabeled outlier rooms that use less/more energy. This was a problem in early exploratory workon the dataset - some of the energy values in the 4th floor dataset were significantly higher thanthe rest of the values in the dataset, indicating that there was likely a very large room that acteddifferently than standard rooms in the building.4.We imputed the training dataset’s missing floored timestamps to have a complete collection oftimestamps every hour from July 7, 2017 at 1 pm (UTC) to August 1, 2018 at midnight (UTC).The imputation value was based off of the median value for the hour (ie. if a timestamp wasmissing on January 1, 2018 at 1:00pm, it was filled with the median energy value for 1:00pmacross the whole training dataset). This was chosen because daily patterns for energy were fairlyregular. We did not impute the testing dataset to ensure that we did not evaluate our model onpredictions of false values.5.Finally, we performed the cost transformation described in the Introduction.
Figure 2: Hour Energy Means (in PST) & Weekday Energy Means for the Original DataModelingPredictive models each have their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, linear models are knownfor their simplicity in predictions yet run both reliably and quickly. On the other hand, models such asartificial neural networks are hailed for their precise results yet do so at the cost of being operationallycomplex. A model suited for one predictive effort might struggle when applied to another venture nomatter the similarity. To conclusively determine which model to use, our group applied the building dataon five different predictive models varying in both complexity and algorithmic principle.
LinearOur group’s initial attempt to predict future energy consumption and spending came about through alinear regression model. This model was specifically created through Scikit-Learn’s linear regressionfunction and utilized info that came with the original dataset, apart from the cost values and the flooredtimestamps, such as humidity, outside air temperature, and setpoint values for temperature and airflow.The floored timestamps were split into different variables for day, hour, minute, second, and weekday.There was insufficient data to use the year value, and month was excluded for the linear model because ofan anomaly in the data where October had much higher median values than the other months.Decision TreeAfter testing the performance of linear regression, our group worked with a variety of predictive models.One of these attempts revolved around the decision tree method. Creating this predictive model was fairlystraightforward due to the similar usage of Scikit-Learn in implementing the decision tree functionality.This model worked with the same data and transformations analyzed by the linear regressor (includinginformation about zone temperature, outside air temperature, and time). The regressor’s max depth wasset to 7 and the minimum samples split to 5 after testing different values via cross-validation.ProphetThe next three models are non-Scikit-Learn based, more complex models we attempted. One of thesemodels is the open source Prophet model6, developedby Meta’s Core Data Science team. The modelmakes time-series based predictions with several seasonal trends measured: yearly, monthly, weekly, andholidays. (Please note: with the way the data was split when testing this model, there was not enough datato analyze yearly trends).The Prophet model is a little less diversified than the other models we tried because it usesexclusively time series values (left as a timezone-naive timestamp) and the predictor variable (energy/costwhen transformed) - leaving out the other data we have available to us surrounding humidity, temperaturesetpoints and more. It relies entirely on the timestamps provided which are flawed for this dataset becauseof the inconsistent time ranges, uneven timestamps, and missingness we noted earlier. Nevertheless, welooked at Prophet as an option because of strengths it has apart from that downside: it is quick to train(2-3 minutes each time we ran it) and can easily generate future predictions with themake_future_dataframe method. This means that the model can quickly be retrained and is easy toevaluate for future data, should we be able to obtain it.Neural NetAnother model our group created was an artificial neural network (ANN for short). For the ANN model,the uncleaned data and the cleaned data were again both used. We used the TensorFlow and Keraslibraries to train the model to predict energy from the other features, and fit the model to optimize forMSE. We attempted to improve this score by iterating over different batch sizes and epochs.Unfortunately, in the end, the model failed to converge, as seen in the output score of “negative infinity”,for both the uncleaned and cleaned data, across all combinations of hyperparameters. As such, we optedto proceed with the other models and improve their performance, as reaching an outcome with the neuralnet model would have taken extra heavy lifting and not guaranteed improved performance.AutoregressionHere, we attempted to use Vector Autoregression and regular Autoregression on both the uncleaned andcleaned data. Statistical tests and models are provided by the statsmodels library. We performed statisticaltests Granger causation, cointegration, and ADF to check if the features would work well with the model.After validating to find the order parameter, we fit the model and plotted the predicted values againstactuals. We also modeled a regular autoregressive model, with the same setup as Vector Autoregression.OptimizationWe settled on the Decision Tree model as our final model. Then, we aimed to try and optimize cost byrunning the model on versions of the training set where the two user-defined values were lowered: theCommon (Fahrenheit temperature) Setpoint and the Airflow Setpoint. For the Airflow Setpoint, we had toconsider the constraint of minimum airflow for the rooms. Because of the un-labeled nature of the originaldata points, we did not know the size of the rooms we were studying, so we used two different estimatesof the minimum airflow needed for occupancy - a larger estimate based on the average airflow setpoint inall of the data points (100 cubic feet/minute), a smaller estimate based on a known minimum setpointvalue for smaller rooms in the building (45 CFM), and the unoccupied state of the room (0 CFM).Optimization sets were generated by looping through changes to temperature setpoint, changes to airflowsetpoint, and changes to minimums for airflow setpoint.With these optimized sets, we ran them through the trained model from earlier and then found thedifference between the cost values from the training set and the predicted cost values from the newmodified datasets. We stored those differences, along with the aggregates (mean, medium, minimum,maximum) by the hour. We produced visual results as the main method of analyzing the results of thedocumentation.ResultsModelingModelMSE Data UncleanedMSE Data CleanedLinear Regression~5.3~0.0040Decision Tree Regressor~4.4~0.0040Meta Prophet ModelRange from 45 - 275+~44Neural NetworkFailure to ConvergeFailure to ConvergeAutoregression81.7628.51Figure 3: Mean Squared Errors for 5 Models on Uncleaned and Cleaned DatasetsFor the neural net model,it failed to converge onboth datasets, even with multiple iterations of varioushyperparameters. In the vector autoregression model, the predictions were mostly straight lines withcurves in the beginning. Although not terribly off, it did not predict any meaningful patterns visually [4].Figure 4: Trends Predicted via Autoregression (Blue) and Actuals (Orange)Using autoregression instead of vector autoregression made the model more robust against the irregulartimestamp intervals, but also diluted the time series patterns. The model was also unable to predict veryfar into the future.OptimizationVariableFeature ImportanceActual Supply Flow0.8443523212076758Actual Supply Flow Setpoint0.15348546003820493Outside Air Temp0.0009296463055999001Zone Temperature0.00047143445476579686Humidity0.000414709750093561

The largest temperature setpoint change we tried(10 degrees Fahrenheit) resulted in a median change of 0.0030, while the largest airflow setpointreduction (200 CFM) resulted in a median change of 0.0259.DiscussionModelingThrough our group testing a broad range of predictive models, our expectations were met in some waysand thoroughly defied in others. For example, the decision tree model was originally not intended to bethe final model. However, its performance and accuracy were much better than initially predicted andoutpaced the competing models. The highly complex Prophet model was not nearly as fortunate becauseof its reliance on using timestamp values as a predictor. The model likely tried to accommodate for largeoutliers in both the cleaned and uncleaned datasets leading to unrealistic predictions. To make this modelviable, our group would have had to do a different kind of data cleaning or use data inaccessible to usstudents. On another note, the neural network model proved tough to get working and progress remainedslow throughout. After multiple unsuccessful attempts to get it running, the neural net model wasabandoned due to upcoming deadlines. The autoregression models were also unreliable due to frequentgaps in time for the sensor readings. Although the previous experiment passed the statistical tests,intuitively energy should not affect the power used by the air handling unit. For this reason, the vectorautoregression regression especially may not have worked since the features and labels had little to noinfluence on each other.As a result of our analysis of all five model types we tried, we decided to use the decision tree asour final predictive model. We needed our model to be reliable, which ruled out the neural network fromthe beginning. We also wanted the prediction to be as accurate as possible, and our inability to lower themean squared errors of the Prophet model and autoregression models excluded them. Between the linearregression and decision tree regressor, both had similar mean squared errors and training times (which wewanted to keep low). We ended up selecting the decision tree model over the linear model because wethought it would be more generalizable to future data since the energy values are not strictly linear.OptimizationAir Setpoint & OccupancyWe expected the airflow setpoint factor to be one of the largest predictors of HVAC cost since the amountof energy an HVAC unit has to use depends on its airflow needs. Our initial results seemed to suggest thiswas true, as the airflow setpoint values had a wide range of maximum differences that we explored [6].Examining these maximum differences show that there is a clear pattern of larger cost reductions tied tohigher airflow setpoint reductions (which is expected), but also that the most impact is seen in the middleof the day (about 6am - 6pm).
Figure 6: Heatmap of Max. CostActual- CostPredictedValues Based on Hour (PST) and Air Setpoint ReductionThis distribution can partially be explained by another figure, where we tracked the proportion oftimes the reduction we performed was not fully able to reduce the airflow setpoint to the desired valuebecause it ran into one of the three occupancy lower limits (0, 45, or 100) [7]. As we can see, theproportion of measurements that were unable to be reduced by a given air setpoint reduction value is highfrom 10 pm - 5 am, and then lower during 6 am - 9 pm. While it’s unclear exactly what the cause of thisis, our intuition was that it was likely that the HVAC system was completely turned off from 10 pm - 5am, and was on from 6 am - 9pm (slightly extended business hours). We examined this intuition with abar graph examining the proportion of zeroes (representing no occupancy and the lowest possible airflowsetting) at each time of day [8].
Figure 7: Proportion of Reductions Limited by Hour (PST)Figure 8: Proportion of Zero Values by Hour (PST)We then looked more in depth at the occupancy analysis we performed. We created two bargraphs representing the median differences (between training and optimization cost) by hour and airflowsetpoint, respectively, segmented by the three different occupancy limits we tried [9, 10].
Figure 9: Median Differences by Hour and OccupancyFigure 10: Median Differences by Air Setpoint and OccupancyWhat we find is that overall, the different occupancy limits seem to have inconsistent effects onthese median differences. Carefully examining the median differences by air setpoint shows that theunoccupied level has a slightly higher difference for each air setpoint difference, but that trend is notreflected for each hour (only reflected during the main workday at 9 am, 10 am, and 2 pm). These resultswere surprising to us, as we know that occupancy has a significant relationship with airflow because airneeds are tied to the number of people in a room, and led us to believe something with our data neededfurther analysis.
We also saw a large change in the first figure between the median differences at the beginning &end of the work day (7-8 am, 5-6 pm) compared to the rest of the day which was not visible in ourheatmap of maximum differences. This also contributed to the idea that this optimization analysis hadlimits. We believed that there could be an energy toll associated with the start and end of the day - weexamine this notion later in the section below.Exploring Temperature & Flaws with Optimization ProcessThe other change we made for the sake of optimization was reducing temperature setpoint values, butcreating similar visuals to the airflow setpoint changes showed even less of a change. This is when welooked at the model’s feature importance to see if we had made a mistake [5].It turns out that we had made a mistake, albeit not with our visualizations. Rather, the temperaturesetpoint value was very unimportant to the overall cost calculation, ending up as the fifth least importantfeature. Examining these model weights demonstrated the actual values (highlighted in orange) instead ofthe user-set values we changed (highlighted in yellow) were more important in the model. Looking atvisualizations for the variables provides some further insight into this [11].
Figure 11: Line Graphs for Variables in the DatasetVia Figure 11, the outside and zone temperaturesboth had very different distributions to thetemperature setpoint, so those trends are likely more important to monitor than the temperature setpointvalues for energy costs. Optimizing temperature likely involves figuring out how temperature setpoint canbe made to more closely match zone temperature. More interestingly, the difference in the featureimportances for the actual airflow values and the airflow setpoint values ended up surprising us and led usto reexamine our initial optimization work. We plotted a regression of the airflow values against eachother to compare the two [12].
Figure 12: Plot of Residuals of Regression on Actual Airflow vs SetpointAs seen in the plot, the actual airflow and setpoint values are mostly correlated, except for a set ofanomalies where one of the values is set to 0 and the other values are not 0. So instead of optimizing theairflow as we were intending when we reduced airflow setpoint, we were likely optimizing for thesecases. This provided a new perspective for our optimization attempts for airflow setpoint: understandingwhen these differences tend to occur and improving the HVAC system to output airflow to better matchthe setpoint values would be the key to more successful optimization attempts. Then, airflow and theairflow setpoint could be treated as the same variable and be permuted in the way we attempted to. In away that we did not anticipate, the difference between the two variables circled back to the idea ofoccupancy and occupancy limits - when does a user say they are in a space compared to when air actuallyoutputs to a space? This also acts as an explanation of the time periods when our optimization was mostsuccessful, between 7-8 am and 5-6 pm: these periods likely represent when a user turns their local HVACsystem on and off, which causes larger deviations from the actual supply flow values. For future analysisinto optimizing how to limit deviations between actual values and setpoint values and optimize energyvalues, looking at these periods would likely be the first step.ConclusionsOur experience was defined by a combination of difficult failures and great successes. For the aspects thatdid not end up as we hoped: we found from the beginning that obtaining building data proves to be one ofthe largest challenges. We encourage future building designers at UC San Diego and otherwise to considerhow data will be extracted in the design of future (smart) buildings. We also found that attempting tooptimize setpoint values is ineffective when setpoints and actual values are separated, so any futureoptimization attempts on user setpoints need to first reduce differences or somehow devalue the actualvalues. Part of doing that analysis involves having up to date occupancy information to understand whenthe actual values or the setpoint values are accurate.Despite our failures, we did make important discoveries about this data. We found great successin predicting energy and cost usage with simple (linear and decision tree) models. With additional time totrain more advanced models, we believe it is possible to improve upon those predictions as well. We alsofound when there is an energy toll for users to turn on/off their local HVAC setpoint by analyzing outputhourly, creating opportunities for future data analysts and building designers to correct for thesedifferences for long-term benefit and energy reduction.
Future Modeling AnalysisWhile we were successfully able to predict cost values for our time period covered, limitations in ourearly process lead to multiple avenues in which this venture could be expanded upon. Firstly, this modelcould be used to analyze HVAC costs during the COVID lockdowns (2020-2021 roughly). COVIDfundamentally changed how air circulation worked at UCSD and will need newer data to create ageneralizable model. An ambitious project could involve using our predictive model to actively automateHVAC adjustments via BRICK programming. Occupancy, air circulation standards, time of day, and otherrequirements could be referenced to improve the minute-to-minute HVAC processes. Even smalloptimizations could save organizations sums of money in the long run. Another large-scale plan could usethis predictive model’s framework to analyze the cost-benefit of non-HVAC energy uses. Light fixtures,especially those that can shift their brightness, are but one of many smart building areas that stand tobenefit greatly. Finally, the broad application of this project could be streamlined by using BRICKschemafor deployment. Standardizing smart building asset names would significantly expedite the deploymentprocess and ensure uniform changes for buildings outside of UCSD’s scope.AppendixOther DataWe also collected extra data surrounding climate and energy from the National Ocean and AtmosphericAdministration (NOAA)7and the U.S. Energy InformationAdministration (EIA)8, respectively. Weintended to use these datasets to supplement our work with the original model for optimization, but bothdue to time constraints and because of our findings that temperature did not have a significant effect onoptimization.Additional LimitationsAs with most projects, our group faced various challenges and limitations throughout thedevelopment period. One minor example is with regard to our handling of the data timestamps. Thedataset itself has timestamps based on the UTC timezone, however, our group’s analysis is based on thelocal PST timezone. Also, daylight savings caused a portion of the time values to be listed in PST, likelycausing some small misclassifications in the hour column. Another limitation is that the simple modelsused (linear and decision tree) are likely overfitting to our data for the air setpoint values. This could beremedied by summing up room usages to examine the building as a whole, however, a lack of accessiblesensors made this unfeasible. Connecting Brick schema to these sensors would both fix theaforementioned issue as well as better generalize the process as a whole. Finally, as mentioned earlier, thisproject could not completely verify energy sourcing due to a lack of data access. Since we defaulted toonly using UCSD’s energy rates, the cost values are all likely underestimated.Citations1.Brick Schema2.Brick : Metadata schema for portable smart building applications - ScienceDirect3.https://github.com/HYDesmondLiu/B2RL4.UCSD DERConnect5.Fiscal Close: Overview6.Prophet | Forecasting at scale.7.NOAA8.EIA","The authors of this paper discuss the challenges of optimizing and reducing energy usage in smart buildings.

Abstract
Surface water has an important relationship with
both the climate and human well being, thus it is
important for us to monitor and measure bodies
of water as the climate continues to change.
Prior approaches in this field have had a larger
scope and monitored changes throughout large
bodies of water throughout the globe, however
they lack more granular observations of smaller
and more specific bodies of water in the United
States. We attempt to close this gap by analyzing
other important bodies of water throughout the
United States, and specifically we analyzed Lake
Oroville in Northern California. We used images
captured with varying wavelengths on the
electromagnetic spectrum to identify differences
between water and non-water areas, and to
analyze how these bodies of water change over
time.
1  Introduction
1.1  Intr o
Quality of life is said to be captured by an
individual’s state of being. However, this notion
is challenged by the limitation and availability of
resources, such as water. In fact, there has been a
growing discussion on the topic of water
restriction in recent years. More specifically, in
the state of California the concern of water
shortages, alongside a growing fear of water
limitations, has been imposed on its residents.
Of course, there are a number of variables that
contribute to the state's ongoing issue. For
instance, California boasts a substantial
agriculture industry, one that demands a
substantial amount of water. Nevertheless, in the
past couple of decades these concerns have only
seemed to elevate as California's water reserves
continue to deplete. An essential resource
required for the sustainability of the state’s
immense agricultural industry, and its dense
population.
1
Indeed, there has been a dramatic rise in the
development of data driven solutions in an effort
to mitigate such environmental distress. Across
many domains, a myriad of scientists and
researchers strive to implement solutions that
quantify and document the long-term changes of
surface water at a global scale. Therefore, the
objective of this statistical analysis report is to
not only supplement existing literature, but to
provide a unique perspective on a localized area
of interest. More precisely, we examined the
spatial and temporal changes of Lake Oroville, a
reservoir in Northern California, using 80
Landsat 8
atmospherically corrected surface
reflectance images
.
1.2  Literatur e Review
Our efforts draw great influence from the work
of Pekel et al. [4], a comprehensive statistical
analysis that quantifies and measures the
long-term variability of global surface water.
The work of these authors is significant because
it provides this variability in surface water at a
high-resolution and more importantly, at an
incredibly large scale. In fact, Pekel et al. [4]
provide this analysis at a 30 meter spatial
resolution over a 32 year span using an immense
amount of satellite imagery data. More
specifically, the authors use the entirety of
Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper, the Landsat 7
Enhanced Thematic Mapper-plus and the
Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager
orthorectified, top-of-atmosphere reflectance
and brightness temperature images (Pekel et al.,
2016). Given the volume of data being used,
solutions in the cloud computing space were
utilized for processing such amounts of data.
Additionally, not only does our work exclusively
examine a localized area of interest, Pekel et al.
[4] also utilize a combination of sophisticated
techniques for such a large scale analysis. For
example, in the task of water detection, a task
that is very much non-trivial at the given scale,
the authors use techniques such as expert
systems, visual analytics, and evidential
reasoning. Methods which they describe as
being less commonly used within the field of
remote sensing (Pekel et al., 2016). These
techniques displayed great practicality in their
work, but also demonstrated to be useful for the
task of water detection in our work as well. For
example, rudimentary forms of evidential
reasoning and visual analytics were employed in
our work specifically to determine what images
were suitable for analysis.

Özelkan [3] provided us with
a few methodologies and ideas to incorporate
into our own analysis. The work of Özelkan [3]
centers around the utilization of NDWI indices
derived from Landsat-8 OLI multispectral
satellite images. However, they develop six
different NDWI models for the task of water
detection. By using green, near infrared,
shortwave infrared 1, and shortwave infrared 2
wavelengths, at both 15m and 30m spatial
resolution. Özelkan [3] aimed to demonstrate
which of these six NDWI models produced the
best results and accuracy of Atikhisar Dam
(Özelkan, 2019).
Finally, our work shares a few parallels to that of
Hui et al. [1], in which they attempt to model the
spatial and temporal changes of a localized area
of interest, Poyang Lake (Hui et al., 2008).
Although our work does not directly follow in
the footsteps of Hui et al. [1], examining their
literature helped us form a conceptual
framework for the given problem.
In any case, our work attempts to supplement
existing literature of such authors by conducting
an statistical analysis of a localized area of
interest, Lake Oroville.
21.3  Data Description
We use satellite images taken from the USGS
Landsat 8 Level 2, Collection 2, Tier 1 surface
reflectance dataset. There are 9 spectral bands
available for us to use captured every 2 weeks
with a 30 meter resolution. The dataset
comprises images that were captured from
March 2013 till the present day, enabling us to
analyze the alterations in the surface water of
Lake Oroville during the preceding decade. With
the various spectral bands captured by the
satellite we can distinguish between surface
water and non surface water areas at a 30 m
resolution.
In order to compare and quantify how accurate
our NDWI model's estimated surface water was,
satellite imagery was collected from J
RC
Monthly Water History, v1.4 from the Google
Earth Engine Catalog. This dataset was
developed by Pekel el al. [4] and demonstrated
to be the most reliable way to compare our
results. Due to the fact that their findings,
research, and methodologies are well respected
in the satellite imagery domain. Therefore, we
reasoned that it would provide
for validation
data.
2  Methods
2.1  ETL
Google Earth Engine was our primary method
for data collection, as it provides a flexible and
robust API to extract, transform, and load
satellite image data. This process was initiated
by using built in functions to select and filter
Landsat 8 images based on a desired time frame.
We selected the earliest date
USGS Landsat 8
Level 2, Collection 2, Tier 1
allowed, which was
March 18, 2023. Our end date was selected in
the same fashion, providing at the time was
October 24, 2022. It was reasoned that selecting
the complete timeframe would be fitting to
acquire a precise comprehension of the
spatiotemporal dynamics of Lake Oroville’s
surface area.
The presence of cloud disturbance posed a
significant obstacle during the initial stages of
our analysis, requiring us to mitigate the
potential issues by minimizing cloud noise to
accurately classify water and non-water features
within a given image. Therefore, we attempted
to filter the data based on the percentage of
cloud covering in an image. This was initially
done by experimenting with a cloud cover
percentage parameter, however it was ultimately
decided that using a threshold of 0.5 would
produce clean enough data to analyze. As
lowering or increasing this threshold did not
improve the quality of images with respect to
cloud disturbance by a significant amount.
Subsequently, it was determined that the optimal
approach to address the challenges arising from
cloud disturbance was to selectively eliminate
such images from our analysis. After the
filtering of satellite data was performed we then
proceeded to generate false color images by
computing the Normalized Difference Water
Index (NDWI). As this would then allow us to
classify between water and non-water surfaces
in a given image.
3 𝑁𝐷𝑊𝐼(𝐵3, 𝐵5) = 𝐵3 − 𝐵5𝐵3 + 𝐵5
 𝑁𝐷𝑊𝐼(𝐵3, 𝐵6) = 𝐵3 − 𝐵6𝐵3 + 𝐵6
 𝑁𝐷𝑊𝐼(𝐵3,𝐵7) = 𝐵3 − 𝐵7𝐵3 + 𝐵7
This was done by selecting visible green
(SR_B3), near infra-red  (SR_B5), shortwave
infrared 1 (SR_B6) and shortwave infrared 2
(SR_B7) bands. Then using Google’s API to
compute the normalized difference among all
images. These three combinations of bands
would serve as our models for our estimated
surface area. As mentioned previously, this idea
was inspired by
Özelkan [3], where they used
the same types of bands, but produced six
different models by using 15 meter and 30 meter
spatial resolutions. In our case we produced
three different NDWI models at a 30 meter
resolution.
The images were then exported and downloaded
locally using geemap, a third party library for
interactive mapping with Google Earth Engine
(Wu, 2020). The dataset developed by Pekel et.
al [4] was also extracted and loaded from
Google Earth Engine in a similar fashion.
2.2  EDA
These bands were also collected as individual
images for exploratory analysis purposes.
While performing our exploratory analysis we
found that the first image of our dataset
contained missing pixel values for an image on
the date 2013-06-03. This was clearly made
evident when plotting the distribution of pixel
values of the B3 band. These missing pixel
values imposed a problem when attempting to
calculate the area of the lake, as they were being
included in the calculations. Due to the fact that
when computing the NDWI of the given image,
the missing pixels had the same range of values
for water surfaces. Therefore, we did not
consider such images in our calculations.
4
We also explored the distribution of pixel values
for bands SR_S3, SR_S5, SR_B6, and SR_B7.
This allowed us to conceptualize and form
approaches to segment water features in the next
section. As well as visually understand why a
certain model performs better than the others.
Notably, when taking a look at bands 6 and 7
from figure 5, they have the same distribution in
some of the satellite images.
When looking at the distribution for bands
SR_B3 and SR_B5 in figure 5 we see a clear
separation between the two histograms. We then
proceeded to take a closer look at the average
values among all images for these two bands.
We observed some slight differences, however it
is important to note that the distributions from
figure 6 still contain images with cloud noise.
Such images contain very different distributions
to those without cloud disturbance. This is
clearly evident when examining figure 7, which
shows that the two histograms do not separate
well enough to even attempt to classify the two
features (water and non-water) for the given
problem. Therefore, we began leaning towards
histogram-based thresholding in order to classify
water and non-water features and thus reinforced
the idea of excluding images with such noise.
2.3  Water Detection
In order to quantify the spatiotemporal changes
of Lake Oroville, we attempted a few methods to
completely isolate water and non-water surfaces.
Thus, the first attempt was to use an
unsupervised learning technique such as
k-means clustering in order to classify our
images. However, this approach did not produce
results that could be used for accurate results. As
there was still much noise in certain images.
So the approach we took was to use a
thresholding algorithm offered by Sci-kit
Imaging. In our implementation specifically, we
utilized minimum thresholding in order to
determine the thresholds for water and
5
non-water from our NDWI images. This method
computes the histogram for an image and
smoothes it until there are only two maximas
and sets the threshold as the minima between the
two. Thus, we utilized this method for each
image individually. This method created a clear
separation between the water and non-water
areas, however for some unused images there
were noise and other factors from the original
images that created issues and inconsistencies
after processing and thresholding.
With our valid thresholded images we estimated
the surface area of Lake Oroville by counting
the pixels classified as water in our processed
images. In order to assess the accuracy of our
model, we compared our values to a validation
dataset created by Pekel et. al. [4] which also
classifies water and non-water areas. We also
distinguished permanent water from seasonal /
ephemeral water in Lake Oroville by comparing
all of the images pixel by pixel. If a pixel
appears in more than 70% of images then it can
be considered permanent water and any pixel
under this threshold is considered ephemeral
water.
63  Results
7
4  Discussion
As seen in our results section, our current model
produces results that fall into one of three
categories: successful thresholding, failure due
to missing data, or failure due to noise. Most of
our data can be successfully thresholded with
our current methods, however there are some
processed NDWI images that were generated
with missing data thus implying water where
there should not be. Another failed scenario
occurs when the images captured by LANDSAT
are muddied by clouds or other noise that cause
specific bands to be nearly unusable. We also
found a general upward trend of water surface
area until about 2021, where there was a sharp
drop-off. This can be observed in Table n and
Figure n, however we do not have much
confidence in the validity of these results as the
amount of  image data varies from year to year,
which would ultimately affect our surface area
estimates.
Our results are similar to other granular analysis
of small bodies of water up until 2020, as an
analysis of inland water in Sri Lanka [2] found a
similar upwards trend in water surface area.
However, our results require more image data to
increase the confidence level of our predictions.
Our approach is limited upon the availability of
image data for Lake Oroville, and the time
limitation for this quarter. Our approach can be
improved upon by 1. obtaining more image data
and 2. preparing the images through a
pre-processing pipeline in order to mitigate
noise and other issues as much as possible. More
in depth analysis on the channels of water from
Lake Oroville as well as the intra-annual
changes and patterns would also be an
interesting topic to further explore.

Abstract
Satellites are being launched into space at an exponential rate and are able to produce high
quality images in relatively short intervals of time on any part of Earth. The amount of data and
types of it are also increasing significantly and in this paper we specifically use Synthetic Aperture
Radar (SAR) satellite imagery in order to detect ships traveling through bodies of water. We
created a ship counting tool that intakes a start date, end date, and an area of interest and returns
the number of ships for each day between the two dates. We propose a new method where the
images are first classified as either offshore or inshore and a separate object detection algorithm
counts the number of ships per image. The classifier and object detection networks are trained
using the Large-Scale SAR Ship Detection Dataset-v1.0 (LS-SSDD-v1.0) and deployed on Google
Earth Engine.
1 Introduction
With recent advances in algorithms and technology within the realm of computer vision, satellite
imagery has become an applicable field of study. Roughly 1700 commercial satellites were launched
in 2021, bringing the total to 5,000 satellites orbiting Earth by the end of 2021. These satellites can
complete an orbit around Earth in under 2 hours and take 5m resolution pictures from over 500 km
away providing vast amounts of image data. Using computer vision techniques, we are able to obtain
necessary information from the images. Specifically, analyzing satellite imagery for ship detection has
been subject to a lot of research where different satellites and detection models have been created and
improved on for better speed and accuracy. One of the most widely used image data within this sphere
has been the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Previously, optical satellites have been known
to produce some of the highest resolution images, however with the drawback that it can only produce
high resolution images under certain time of day and weather conditions. SAR’s strengths lie in the
fact that it use radio signals to produce high quality images even if it is cloudy or at night time.
Ship detection has been a popular subject for research within the fields of object detection. And
with the use of SAR satellite imagery, machine learning and deep learning models are able to more
accurately detect vessels across the globe. With uses in various economic tasks, search and rescue
operations, aiding in determining military decisions, managing ship traffic, and monitoring possible
illegal activity, not only do models have to be accurate, but they also need to be quick as well.
Previously, other researchers were only to do classification or extract the region of interest from an
image. Now, with the emergence of deep learning, we are able to automatically detect vessels without
the need of handcrafted features or large amounts of computational resources. First we use classical
machine learning to classify an image and then utilize deep learning models like RetinaNet and Faster
R-CNN to produce accurate and rapid results for the task of detecting ships in SAR images.
2 Literature Review
A research group in China [15] released their paper on ship detection and the accompanying dataset:
LS-SSDD-v1.0. Their goal was to create the most accurate dataset for cargo ship detection from SAR
1images. In order to provide the most accurate ground truth annotations, the team used Automatic
Identification System (AIS) to locate ships in a specific image and label them. Additionally, the
images were overlaid on top of an optical Google Earth engine map to make sure no small islands
were annotated as ships. The images were collected in large swaths up to 250 km in size from 15
different locations around the globe, mimicking the data the algorithm will be deployed on. Ships of
various sizes were annotated including large cargo container ships and smaller fishing vessels. The
large images were divided into smaller ones so they can be easily fit into a training network. None of
the images were discarded even with no ships. Overall, this dataset attempts to improve every aspect
of previously released datasets for SAR ship detection and that is why we will be using it in this paper.
There are a few other datasets for this task, but we did not choose them due to a variety of reasons.
The first one being SSDD [6] dataset, Figure 1 Row 1. It contains 1160 SAR images that are 500 ×500
pixels and obtained from a mix of satellites with varying resolutions. Two major drawbacks are that
annotations are not double checked with Google Earth or AIS and there are numerous repeated scenes,
which does not benefit our model. Another dataset we considered was SAR-Ship-Dataset, [14] which
contains 43k SAR images of size 256 ×256 pixels and contains 60k ships, Figure 1 Row 2. Once
again the images were collected from many different satellites so their resolutions differ. One change
from the previous dataset was that all images without ships were discarded, which increases false
positive rate. The labeling on this dataset was done by SAR experts, which still leaves room for error.
To combat some of these issues, AIR-SARShip-1.0 [13] a dataset was proposed, which contained 31
SAR images of size 3000 ×3000 pixels, Figure 1 Row 3. However, these images contained too much
noise which reduced the effectiveness of the ship detector. Also, the ground truth was determined
by experts solely. The last dataset we considered was the High-Resolution SAR Images Dataset [12]
which contained 5604 SAR images of size 800x800 pixels of various resolutions, Figure 1 Row 4. In
this dataset, the ground truth was determined using Google Earth, but images with pure backgrounds
were abandoned. Thererfore, we chose the LS-SSD-v1.0 dataset to use for our experimentand images
from the dataset we used can be found in the data section.

Dataset, AIR-SARShip-1.0, High-Resolution SAR Images Dataset. Image Source: [15]
Kanjir et al. released a paper reviewing 119 papers on ship detection using optical satellite images.
In addition, they also compared and contrasted the different imaging systems used for vessel detection
such as optical and reflected infrared, hyperspectral, thermal infrared, and radar [5].
Each of the imaging systems has their pros and cons, but radar and specifically Synthetic Aperture
Radar (SAR) satellites are the best sensor for ship detection. Hyperspectral sensors and thermal
infrared both have too low of a spatial resolution to be used for ship detection. While optical satellites
have a high spatial resolution, bad weather conditions may make it hard for an optical satellite to get
clear images. For example, Figure 2 below showcases an example of an optical image that is covered
2mainly by clouds and can make classification quite difficult. In addition, it is also dependent on the
reflection of sunlight off the Earth’s surface, so if it is an overcast day or even at nighttime, the optical
satellite cannot get clear images. SAR on the other hand is able to consistently collect high resolution
images over a wide area due to its use of radar signals that are bounced off the Earth’s surface. In
addition, radar signals allow the SAR satellite to be able to collect data regardless of time of day as
well as most weather conditions. Not only that, but larger ships often appear as bright objects in SAR
images because many are made of metal and contain sharp edges that reflect the radar signals very
strongly and allow for better ship detection. There are some drawbacks with SAR images being noisy,
having a tough time detecting small ships, being sensitive to high winds and certain sea conditions,
and classification of vessels is difficult [5]. Despite these drawbacks SAR satellite imagery is the best
system we have for collecting consistent high quality images.
Figure 2: Clouds are a major nuance when dealing with optical data. Image Source: [5]
Chang [4] firstly explores older object detection methods and models to give background, but more
importantly compares and contrasts the more recent sophisticated deep learning models that have been
popular. They compare the R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN and finally the YOLOv2 models in
the order of how each model improves on the other. R-CNN is the slowest model out of all of them
which led to the development of the Fast R-CNN model that improves runtime by utilizing a much
faster softmax function instead of support vector machines [4]. Both the R-CNN and Fast R-CNN
models are two stage detector models, and use a selective search algorithm to identify a small subset
of regions that might contain a ship, and then use a region based CNN to classify it. The Faster
R-CNN model significantly improves on this by allowing a neural network with attention to predict
the proposed areas that might contain a ship, and use the same convolution network to perform the
classification [10]. The Faster R-CNN model also uses anchor boxes in order to predetermine areas of
interest for each single proposed area allowing it to detect objects at different scales and aspect ratios.
In essence, the Region Proposed Network guides the region-based CNN where to look for the object,
which overall reduces the inference time compared to smaller models such as YOLOv2.
The You Only Look Once (YOLO) model performs faster than Faster R-CNN due to the fact that
the whole model is contained in a single network. This allows for easier optimization during training. In
addition, since the Faster R-CNN model only looks at regions in isolation, it often misidentifies parts of
the background as objects. On the other hand, the YOLO model sees the whole image during training
and is able to learn contextual information which leads to better classification. In their results,[4] show
that YOLOv2 had around 20% better accuracy on two different datasets than Faster R-CNN and also
performed around 5.8 times faster than Faster R-CNN [4]. These performance results made it quite
clear to us that the YOLO models would be beneficial for our task.
The last family of object detection algorithms that we looked at were Single Shot Detector (SSD).
They are similar in speed to the YOLO model but offer the accuracy close to that of the Fast R-CNN
models. RetinaNet is one of the most common models in the SSD family and consists of two main
parts. The first part is the pretrained image classification model that is used for feature extraction
from each region. It also utilizes anchor boxes in order to find the initial shape of the object. The
second part of the model is the SSD head, which consists of one or more convolutional layers and
3produces multi scale feature maps that are later converted to bounding boxes and class predictions.
This differs from YOLO in the way that overlapping boxes are dealt with: YOLO uses non-maxima
suppression, while RetinaNet treats it like a regression problem. Using techniques from both types of
models, SSD are able to achieve two stage detector model accuracy while maintaining relatively low
inference times [8].
3 Data
In this paper we will be using the LS-SSDD-v1.0 dataset which is obtained from the C-band from
the Sentinel-1 satellite. Because vessels on water experience higher backscattering values, only the co-
polarization channels (VV) are kept from these images. There are 15 large scale images in this dataset
of size 24,000 x 16,000 pixels. The first ten images are the training set and the last five images are the
test set. In order to be able to load the data onto a GPU during training, each image is cut into 600
equal sized pieces of 800 ×800 pixels. This data we will use for training most resembles the images we
intend to deploy our pipeline due to the large size of the images as well as the quality and resolution
of them. Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5 are some different types of images found in the dataset.
Figure 3: Inshore image with
ships
Figure 4: Inshore image without
a ship
Figure 5: Offshore image with a
ship
Below in Table 1, we can see the distribution of the image data for inshore and offshore as well as
ships or no ships. The large difference in the number of offshore and inshore images motivated us to
split the ship detection problem into two parts. However, we did not train each model on the subset
of inshore and offshore data separately, because we did not have enough data for each one. Only a
third of the images were labeled inshore and offshore so we created a classifier trained on that data to
classify the rest of the images to be inshore or offshore. For the object detection model training, we
only used images with ships in them.
Table 1: Inshore and offshore ship image percentages
Inshore Offshore Totals
Ships 4% 16% 20%
No Ships 24% 56% 80%
Totals 28% 72% 100%
4 Methods
4.1 Inshore-Offshore Classifier
To build our inshore-offshore classifier, we utilized the the portion of the Large-Scale SAR Ship Detec-
tion Dataset-v1.0 (LS-SSDD-v1.0) [15] dataset that contains inshore and offshore labels due to the fact
4that we need our images to be labeled when training our classification models. For training, we used
a 70/30 train to test split ratio to prevent overfitting. For each image, we extracted a set of features
to be used within the model. We took the 30th, 50th, 80th, and 90th percentiles of pixel values. We
decided to use the 80th and 90th percentiles because when looking at images from the training dataset,
we found that images with any sign of land even if the majority of the picture is ocean, is considered
to be inshore. For example, if looking at Figure 6, the majority of the image is blank ocean, however
there is a little bit of land present and therefore the image is labeled inshore. Due to this, we wanted
to use higher percentiles as features to be more robust towards these kinds of cases. In addition, the
30th and 50th percentiles we also used to give a better representation of the images and looking at
the lower percentiles do still prove to be useful. To find the best model for classification, we gathered
a few different machine learning models from scikit-learn (K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM, Decision Tree
Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, AdaBoost, and Gaussian NB) into a list and looped through each
model to test its accuracy. For each individual model, it was fitted and tested on the training and test
sets 10 times and the scores for those 10 runs were averaged to give the score for that model. From
this, we found that the K-Nearest Neighbors worked the best. Then to find the best parameters for
our model, we used 5-fold grid search cross validation. We tested values 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20 for the
number of neighbors, uniform and distance for the weights parameter, and different algorithms such
as ball tree, kd tree, and brute. From our cross validation, we found that the best parameters for our
K-NN model were 5 nearest neighbors, kd tree for the algorithm, and uniform for the weights.
Figure 6: Image with small amount of land labeled as inshore. Image Source: [15]
Previously, when building the inshore-offshore classifier, we used a handcrafted approach utilizing
thresholds to preprocess and classify images. Essentially what this entailed, was first binarizing an
image where all pixel values below the threshold were set to zero, and values greater than or equal to
the threshold value were set to the max value of 255. Then after binarizing the image, the sum of pixel
values was taken as a feature and a classification threshold was used where if the sum of pixel values
was above the threshold, it would be classified as inshore and below the threshold would be classified
as offshore. As it can be seen, this method uses different features compared to the machine learning
models where instead of deriving percentiles of pixel values, the sum of pixel values was used as the
main feature. Conceptually this made sense where offshore images would essentially be mostly black
and have low sum of pixel values, while inshore images would have large pixel values and in practice
it worked pretty well with about a 92% accuracy. However, with this method, a few problems arose
which will be discussed further in the discussion section.
54.2 Object Detection Models
The first class of object detection models we decided to train was YOLOv7. The model we trained
was a YOLOv7-D6, with 154.7 million parameters and it is able to do real time inference at 44 frames
per second. This is a relatively light-weight model that trades accuracy for speed. During training, we
used the entire data set and train/test split as specified by the author of the dataset. Additionally, for
the model we downsized the images to 640 by 640 pixels, used a batch size of 8, and trained for 200
epochs. For the hyper parameters, we used the default ones given in the training script for momentum,
learning rate, and optimization function. The YOLOv7-D6 models took and 17 hours to train on a
GeForce RTX 2080TI. After training the model, we experimented with a variety of thresholding values
and found that 0.25 worked the best.
The next two models we used were trained in Pytorch and we only used images with ships for them
due to how the optimizer was set up. This brought the number of images down from the original 9,000
to about 1,900 images and we kept them in the original 800 by 800 pixel size without downsizing. We
attempted to solve this issue by introducing image augmentations such as rotating and noise, but were
unable to implement such features given our time frame. To solve this issue, we trained our algorithms
for more iterations on the training set.
One model we used was RetinaNet [8] and we used it with a ResNet-50-FPN backbone that was
pre-trained on the COCO dataset [7]. We also changed the output layer to only two classes, which
were ship and background. After a few hyperparameter tests, we found the best ones for training using
stochastic gradient descent were batch size of 10, 300 epochs, learning rate of 0.001, and a momentum
value of 0.9. It took about 12 hours to train on a GTX 1080TI.
The next model we used was the Faster R-CNN [10] and it also had a ResNet-50-FPN backbone.
We replaced the pre-trained head for the classifier with our two output classes of ship and background.
For the hyper parameters we found the best values to be batch size of 10, 300 epochs, learning rate of
0.0001 and momentum of 0.7. It took 14 hours to train on a GTX 1080TI.
4.3 Downloading Google Earth Engine Images
The data we intend to deploy our model on is the Sentinel-1 SAR image collection on Google Earth
Engine. To access this data, we built a helper function that takes in the coordinates of the desired area
as well as the start and end dates that the user wants to pull from. The coordinates for this function
can be found on the Google Earth Engine Code editor where you create a rectangular bounding box
over the desired area of the map and within the console, it will show the coordinates of the bounding
box. The helper function will download the set of images locally as .tif files. The bands we chose
when downloading our images was the VV single co-polarization band. With this band, ships provide
better reflections of the radar signals compared to some of the other polarization bands such as VH
and make it ideal for ship detection [15]. In addition, we have to do some additional cleaning of the
image values because as it can be seen in Figure 7, the image appears to have a gray tint to it. This
is because the values are usually between 0 and 1 and must stretch the original image by 10 log10(I).
Fixing this requires clipping images values from -20 to 0 where values less than -20 are set to -20 and
values greater than 0 are set to 0 [9]. As it can be seen in Figure 8, it creates a much more contrasted
and clearer image. From there, we use another helper function to pad and then split the image into
sub-images. The helper function first pads the full images with black pixels to the next biggest multiple
of 800 ×800 pixels so that each image will cleanly be split up into sub images of size 800 ×800 pixels.
The reason why we split the images into sub-images of 800 ×800 pixels is because our inshore-offshore
classifier and object detection models predict on images of that size. We pad the images with the value
-20 because after we clipped the values in the original image, -20 represents a black pixel. In addition,
we chose to pad our images rather than resize them as to reduce possible distortions when resizing to
the next biggest multiple of 800 ×800 pixels. The helper function finally then splits the image into an
array of dimensions m×n×800×800, where m×nare the grid of sub images generated with each
sub image being 800 ×800. We then flatten this array into a m·n×800×800 so that we don’t have
to use a nested for loop when iterating over the set of sub-images and reduces the overall run time of
the final ship counting script.

5 Results
5.1 Inshore-Offshore Classifier
Table 2 shows a comparison of the different classification methods for the inshore-offshore classifier. As
it can be seen, the handcrafted thresholding method is the fastest running time of about 13 seconds,
while the slowest being AdaBoost. K-Nearest Neighbors had the best average accuracy of .972 with
Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Decision Tree showing very similar average accuracies of 0.967, 0.961,
and 0.59 respectively. The worst performing classifier in terms of average accuracy was the Naive
Bayes Gaussian classifier with a score of 0.88.

Decision Tree 0.959 104.10

K-Nearest Neighbors 0.972 111.45

5.2 Object Detection Models
For selecting the best object detection model, we first needed to find the best thresholding value for
each model. We ran the model on the test set using 20 different thresholding values from 0 to 1 and
picked the one with the highest F1 score. Other metrics we looked at were presion, recall, and mAP.
After running the thresholding experiment, we found the optimal values for each mode, and their
metrics on the full test set which can be summarized in Table 3 and Figure 9. The YOLOv7-D6 had
a confidence threshold of 0.25, which led it to have precision of 0.93, a recall of 0.5, an mAP of 0.49,
and an F1 score of 0.65. It only took 32.44 seconds for the model to run on the full test set of images
with ships. The next model was RetinaNet and it had a confidence threshold of 0.8, precision of 0.71,
recall of 0.75, mAP of 0.66, an F1 score of 0.73, and a run time of 50.21 seconds on the full test set.
Lastly, the Faster R-CNN model had a confidence threshold of 0.7, precision of 0.94, recall of 0.92,
mAP of 0.91, F1 score of 0.93 and took 53.01 seconds to run on the test set.
We also wanted to look at metrics grouped by inshore or offshore. There were only 619 offshore
images and 117 inshore images in the test set, so some of the metrics might be skewed due to the
small sample size. Figure 10 and Table 4 summarize the metrics of the inshore images of the object
detection algorithms. We can see that relative to the overall values, these metrics were much worse

6 Discussion
6.1 Inshore-Offshore Classifier
As mentioned before, the handcrafted method proved to do well on the training dataset especially in
terms of runtime, however, a few problems arose when using this method:
1. The LS-SSDD-v1.0 authors’ definition of inshore was an image with any bit of land in it, so
images with even just a little bit of land were classified as inshore. This proved to be a problem
with using the sum of pixel values as a feature, because the sum of pixel values for these types
of inshore images would be low due to the large portion of the image being dark and would
therefore be misclassified.
2. Also for some images that have a more gray tint, there would still be a lot of white pixels after
binarization and would then make the total sum of pixel values of the image pretty high. See
Figure 12 and Figure 13
3. Another problem would be with generalization of our model because these threshold values were
based on these images we already had, but the data we would get from Google Earth Engine
might not be the same.
Due to these problems, training a machine learning model proved more beneficial because it is more
generalizable for a new set of images and is more robust towards some of these edge cases.
When training and testing the different models, many of the models performed quite similarly in
terms of both runtime and average accuracy. Table 2 shows that the Decision Tree, Random Forest,
and K-Nearest Neighbors classifiers all had quite high accuracies as well as fast runtimes relative to
each other. The other models like Adaboost and Naive Bayes Gaussian models either were much
slower than its counterparts or had a much lower average accuracy. However, we chose to go with
the K-Nearest Neighbors classifier due to the fact that it consistently performs well and the slightly
slower runtime can be compromised with better accuracy. In our application, we want to ensure more
accurate predictions so that we can correctly feed inshore and offshore images into their respective
ship detection models. In cases of misclassification, feeding an offshore image into our inshore classifier
may end up slowing down the overall pipeline and feeding an inshore image into the offshore classifier
may produce less accurate ship counts. Due to these reasons, the K-Nearest Neighbors classifier best
suited our use case.
9Figure 12: Gray offshore image
 Figure 13: Binarized gray offshore image
6.2 Object Detection Models
From the above metrics, we can see that the Faster R-CNN had the highest accuracy scores, but was
slowest on inference. Figure 14 is an inshore image with no ships in it and to the right of it is the
Faster R-CNN predictions. We can see that the algorithm has made some false predictions. When we
look closer we can see that the areas it predicts are bright spots with darkness around them, similar
to a ship on the open sea. Figure 15 contains two images, with the left image being the ground truth
and the right image contains the predictions of the model. The majority of the ships are detected
correctly, with one bright spot being misclassified. The model might mistake the noise for some ship.
Overall, the model does well enough for the given task, but there is always room for improvement.
Figure 14: Ground Truth and Faster R-CNN
prediction on an inshore image
Figure 15: Ground Truth and Faster R-CNN
prediction on an offshore image
For the tool, a separate object detection algorithm for the inshore and offshore images is needed.
Faster R-CNN will do best for the inshore images, but RetinaNet is almost as good as Faster R-CNN
on the offshore images. The F1 score of the two images only differs by 0.07, so there will only be a
negligible tradeoff in accuracy. The speed up is also relatively small, of only about 3 seconds between
the two models. However, we believe the small sacrifice in accuracy will be worth the potential speed
up of the tool, because the majority of the images are going to be offshore ones.
107 Applications
7.1 Tool Overview
All of the pieces for the tool are ready and it is time to combine them. The process can be visualized
in Figure 16. The first step is getting all of the raw SAR images using the Google Earth Engine API.
Then, each image is preprocessed by clipping all the pixel values between -20 and 0 to remove the
gray tint, and zero padded to be sharded into 800 by 800 pixel sub images. After, it is passed into
a inshore/offshore classifier and that determines which object detection model counts the number of
ships in it. The details of running the tool locally can be found on our Github [3].
Figure 16: Workflow of our Tool
We tried two different versions of the tool, one as described as above and one where we only
used Faster R-CNN for ship counting. To test, we used the full sized test images in the test set and
calculated the Root Mean Squared Error of the ship counts as our metric. The results are shown in
Figure 17. The regular tool slightly does better on the RMSE metric and a lower runtime than the
Faster R-CNN. We hope the difference in speed would translate to scale.
7.2 Ever Given Stuck in the Suez Canal (March 23, 2021 - March 29, 2021)
One application that our tool can be used on is to look at the effect of the Suez Canal blockage in
2021. On March 23, 2021, a massive container ship named the Ever Given got lodged diagonally within
the Suez Canal. This blockage cost global trade an estimated $6 billion to $10 billion a day. Then
on March 29 that same year, the Ever Given was finally freed [11]. By using our tool, we can view
these effects by looking at differences in the number of ships before, during, and after the blockade.
As we can see in Figure 18, a few days before the blockade, there are roughly 44 ships going into the
canal. But during the blockade (See Figure 19), we can see the number of ships outside the canal
jumps up to 95 ships and then after the ship is freed, the number goes back down to around 54 ships
(See Figure 20). We can see how drastic the blockage caused, not only through the numbers, but also
through our satellite images. One thing to note though is that our object detection model doesn’t
11Figure 17: Metrics of the tool on the test set
seem to identify the ships within the canal, which could possibly be due to the fact that it thinks that
the canal and ships within the canal are land due to the fact that the canal itself is pretty small and
is surrounded by land on all sides.

Stuck (3/20/2021): 44 ships

127.3 Activity in the Port of Los Angeles during COVID Lockdown (February
2020 - April 2020)
Another use case could be analyzing activity within the Port of Los Angeles before, during, and after
the COVID-19 lockdown. The Port of Los Angeles is one of the most active ports in America and is
one of the most important ports that connects America to International trade [1]. During the year
2020, the world was hit with a worldwide pandemic and in March of 2020, America went on a lockdown
[2]. Due to this worldwide event, we thought it would also be interesting to see how activity within
the Port of Los Angeles changed throughout the first few months of lockdown. When at the count of
ships in Figure 22 compared to Figure 21 and Figure 23, the number of ships as the lockdown was
happening dropped by almost 10-20 compared to both a month before and month after.
Figure 21: Before COVID Lock-
down (2/4/2020): 52 ships
Figure 22: During COVID Lock-
down (3/17/2020): 33 ships
Figure 23: After COVID Lock-
down (4/11/2020): 43 ships
8 Conclusion
Our goal is for the ship counting tool we have created to be used for other projects such as political
policy monitoring, or economic modeling. The modularity of it allows for different parts of the tool
to be easily replaced or reconfigured. For example, if a new object detection model is created it can
be easily trained and swapped with the current one in the tool. Another example is if a new source
of satellite imagery data becomes open source or purchased it can be inputted into the tool instead
of Google Earth Engine. Since our framework is novel, we hope that others continue to build and
improve upon this tool or apply it for a beneficial purpose.

Abstract
The Solar Energy Innovation Laboratory (SOLEIL), under Professor David Fenning, has been
manufacturing and collecting perovskite solar cell data at an increasing rate. This data, which comes in
many different formats, is hard to store, query, and analyze due to its complexity. The team would carry
out their analyses by breaking down the data by sample batch and running analysis code on each, creating
a lot of redundancies in their data analysis pipeline. In addition, the raw data itself is currently being sent
to a Google Drive folder in a partially unregulated manner. The team hopes to better utilize their data to
improve their solar cells - our project seeks to create a database that allows them to record data in a
predictable manner, and easily query the data for analysis and visualization purposes. We are looking to
use either a Relational Database or a Graph Database approach to clean up and store the team’s raw lab
data so that they can easily access and query data as needed.
Introduction
Our project group works with Prof. David Fenning, an assistant professor in NanoEngineering at
UC San Diego, who runs the Solar Energy Innovation Laboratory. The lab aims to manufacture and test
solar cells to improve them in different ways - lifespan, efficiency, and manufacturing consistency, to
name a few. The lab is in a phase where they have an established manufacturing process and robust data
collection, but lack a data storage and analysis procedure that allows for consistency, accessibility, and
scaleup. Our group aims to design and build a database solution that allows the lab to organize their
existing data, easily add new cells’ data, and efficiently draw insights. Some of the requirements and
considerations for this database include:
-
Individual, cell-level chemical compositions, linked to traceable batches of chemicals
-
Detailed, cell-level manufacturing data (e.g. steps, completion time)
-
Cell-level performance metrics, in a variety of data types (e.g. single integers vs. entire tables)
-
Fast queries over a large scale of data for visualization and analysis purposes
-
Data insertion, edits, and deletion are operations that are less frequent
-
A modular structure that allows for future addition of new procedures, steps, or metrics
Our group is currently evaluating the differences between a Graph Database and a traditional
Relational Database (RDB). We have hypothesized that a Graph Database might be more suitable due to
the lab’s need for fast queries; RDBs are theoretically slower due to an O(n) join time in addition to the
O(log(n)) lookup time, for both database types

hope to verify this via testing by the end of this

and format past data, so that it can be migrated into the new database when it is built.
Prior Work
For reference, our group looked at some existing databases to attempt to understand how other
people approached storing their data, along with investigating the type of data they held. One of the
solutions, “DuraMAT’s Data Hub”
2
, seemed quite basic;
it basically was just an online, open-source
repository to upload and share data/documents. While the data is shared and easily accessible, one of the
cons to this approach is that the data is uploaded in many formats, ranging from CSVs to image files, to
PDFs and others, which makes it difficult to perform analysis and queries as it would require tons of data
cleaning and wrangling.
Two of the other databases focused strongly on storing materials and their properties. These
databases, “The Materials Project”
3
and “HybriD3”
4
,
allow for querying material data via several filters,
such as a material’s chemical composition, properties (thermodynamic/physical properties), etc. This is
great for searching for material data, which may be used during the experimentation process to create new
solar cell units, or during the analysis process, where some material data may need to be referenced. For
our use case, we would ideally want a way to store additional data, such as manufacturing data (steps,
etc.), performance metrics, and other information, as mentioned previously.
The last database we referenced was The Perovskite Database
5
, which seems to have many of the
features we want in our solution, but also would likely require a lot of time to achieve. The Perovskite
Database’s paper
6
gave us a lot of information about
their solution and how ours differs. The issues their
database approach solves have a lot of similarities with the problems we’re trying to solve, such as
making access to analysis and machine learning more available by creating an organized database and
including experimental data like performance metrics. The developers mention that they looked at several
materials databases like we did, and that while these solutions were a good start towards organizing data,
they lacked important data like performance metrics, which are extremely useful for evaluating device
performance. In those regards, our goals are similar, but one difference between our solutions is the
modularity of the database. From what we have seen their data is tabular; stored in CSVs. We want to
investigate RDBs and Graph Databases to see if these solutions are better for our context, where data
entered may have varying amounts of steps, materials, and performance metrics between experiments. An
additional consideration we are looking into with these Relational/Graph databases is query time, since
the lab team hopes to prioritize quick queries for fast analysis and visualization.
Data Description
We aim to find a database solution that fits existing perovskite cell data, which has intrinsic,
complex relationships - cells have differing chemical compositions, steps, and metrics. solvents or
precursors used in cells are from different manufacturing batches, and manufacturing steps themselves

.contain a differing number of sub-steps and chemicals. This report provides additional detail on the
existing data in the following sections.
The solution we find may be applicable to other lab contexts that require records of complex
relationships, with a mix of structure and semi-structured data. Any problems that favor fast queries over
fast insertion/deletion/edits may also find our work useful.
Methods
Existing Data Pipeline
SOLEIL has been utilizing a system, PASCAL, to output the lab’s manufacturing data. PASCAL:
1.
Outputs the sample log json, the run log, the characterization raw data folder, and a
dimensionality-reduced single .csv which contains fitted metrics of the raw data.
2.
Depending on what the lab operator tasked PASCAL to collect, the raw data is uploaded to the
lab’s Google Drive. Current metric options from the characterization step are:
i.
PL photostability or PL spectroscopy over time
ii.
Visible light transmission spectroscopy
iii.
PL image
iv.
PL spectroscopy
v.
Brightfield image
vi.
Darkfield image
From this, our group determined we would (1) obtain the existing data, (2) perform data cleaning,
(3) choose an appropriate database format, (4) push the clean data to the chosen database, (5) create
documents/APIs for users to query data, and finally, (6) create documents/APIs for the users to add more
data and maintain the database. In this quarter, we focused on steps 1-4, to ensure that we put ample time
into choosing a relevant and useful solution.
Obtaining Existing Data
Our group first retrieved existing data from the lab’s Drive folder. Every batch is associated with
several output files, but two in particular are relevant to us: the file “maestro_sample_log.json” contains
all the information about the process of making the sample solar cell in a single worklist, and the file
“fitted_characterization_metrics.csv”
contains fitted
metrics of the raw data.
Data Cleaning
The existing data was largely in JSON format. We wrote a Python script to process and clean the
data, and finally parse it into the format that we plan on using. The structure of the
“maestro_sample_log.json” JSON file is as follows:
{“sample0”: {“name”: str, “storage_slot”: dict, “substrate”:
str, “worklist”: list, “hotplate_slot”: dict} , “sample1”:
{...}, ...}
The following are some observations regarding the data:-
The list in the
worklist
field has the manufacturing steps, in order of operation. Some steps,
such as
characterization_task
, for staging to take a characterization image, and
destination
, for moving the sample, are very standardized
and have a fixed format. Because
of this, we can easily flatten the nested dictionary into a list.
-
For steps that do not have fixed steps (such as
drops
),
we do not have a fixed length because
each solution might have many different
solvent
s and
solutes
.
-
solution
s can have
solutes
and a
solvent
, or just
one
solvent
.
-
solutes
are typically stored in a long string format,
for example
”FA0.78_MA0.1_Cs0.12_Pb1.09_I2.7_Br0.491_Cl0.0818”
which indicates all chemicals and their corresponding concentrations that are solutes. The
first entry for solutes (the solutes that are part of the first drop step) are mixed by hand,
outside of the PASCAL machine.
-
solvent
is stored similarly. If a
solution
has an
empty string for
solutes
, and an
entry for
solvent
, this implies that the
solvent
is
actually an antisolvent. The
antisolvent gets dropped in at a later date.
The varying number of steps, chemicals, outputs, and properties led our group to consider a
number of different database solutions.
Choosing a Database
There were two database types that we considered: a traditional relational database (RDB), and a
graph database. After discussing with members of the lab team, we noted that the primary requirements
for the database were to:
1)
Store the worklist of manufacturing steps, as well as all relevant properties and measurements for
each step, ideally with the nominal and actual values, and
2)
Keep track of all chemicals involved, how they change through the manufacturing process, and
ideally relate them to a batch number
3)
Be easily queryable; it should be easy to query for individual solar cell worklists (e.g. fetch all
info associated with sample 0 from batch 1), query by a property (e.g. fetch all spin steps with an
rpm of 200), and ideally query based on the cell’s associated properties (measured after they are
manufactured)
Considering these requirements, we chose to start with a relational database, as the group was
more familiar with these. This would also help us to familiarize ourselves with the data quicker.
Relational Database
We started by creating a basic schema, as follows:Figure 1: Initial RDB Schema Mockup
In the above schema, every row is a column, and all bolded rows indicate primary keys. Tables
with multiple bolded rows indicate compound primary keys. This database keeps track of the worklist by
assigning each step a step_num.
The schema fails to take into account different permutations of the same step - e.g. if a cell has
multiple
hotplate
steps, there will be a non-unique
primary key. A lack of understanding of the data
led to this initial oversight.
The
characterization
table is also a placeholder -
it was intended to hold characterization
outputs, but every row in that table turned out to require a different storage method. Pl_spectroscopy, for
example, is a csv file with wavelengths and transmission, and can’t be fit into the same table as the other
metrics. There is also a difference between the characterization steps themselves (which involve things
like exposure time), and and the characterization outputs/metrics; both need to be recorded.
This table also fails requirement (2), since it puts all chemicals in the
solvents
table. Solvents,
solutes, solutions, and anti-solvents all have different properties, which are not stored in an intuitive
manner here. After continuing to troubleshoot, this schema evolved into the one below:
Figure 2: Updated RDB Schema Mockup
This schema has new
solution_recipes
and
solvent_recipes
tables, to keep track
of the different chemicals and mix compositions used in each drop step. This is also any RDB solution’s
largest limitation - in order for a primary key to exist for chemical data, all four columns must be primary
keys. The lab tries different combinations of chemicals; only one of those columns might change from
experiment to experiment, leaving the other 3 the same.
At this point we conclude that the RDB solution is unavoidably clunky - it would be near
impossible to avoid storing duplicate data, especially with the amount of combinations the lab intends to
try; it will be inflexible when the lab needs to add new properties and new steps; and, in addition, would
have extremely slow query times - as previously mentioned every table would need to be joined (O(n)),
and then queried (O(logn) minimum), every time one query is run.
We then sought direction from someone affiliated with Fenning but working in another lab - Rishi
Kumar - but attempting to solve the same problem. He talked us through both his own graph database
attempt, and another lab’s tabular database solution. We decided to spend the quarter replicating both of
these.
Tabular Database
Kumar explained another tabular solution he knew of - it involved creating a single table, where
every row is a different cell, with a “JSON blob” column that contains the cell’s entire worklist in JSON
format. This removes the need for multiple tables, joins, and complex, step-specific columns. This would
work for analysis as the file could then be imported into some relational database management system,
specifically PostgreSQL, which allows inline JSON queries. The data can then be converted or
extrapolated into a different format for analysis, like a pandas DataFrame.
In our replication of this solution, we produced a table of one column with every row as a sample
by writing a script that extracted out specific characteristics from the JSON worklist file. This solution is
robust because the existing steps do not get affected when a new process is added because the new script
will only interact with the new data. This solution keeps the different processes separated, which allows
for forward and backward compatibility. Below is an example of our script’s output:
Figure 3: Tabular Worklist Solution
While this works, this solution isn’t the most intuitive to use or read. The main issue with this
solution is the scalability of the database. For a database with few updates, this solution works well
because the user does not need to frequently update the csv files, but, for the SOLEIL lab, this solution is
not user friendly because the entire database (with every single csv file) would need to be updated when a
new row of a JSON object is added to the main table. Due to this, our group chose not to dedicate time
importing this into an SQL system - our time would be better spent looking into other solutions.
To complete the proof of concept, however, we wrote a script that can unravel the JSON object
inside each row, extracting attributes such as steps or chemicals. The Figure 4 below depicts the extracted
recipe of anti-solvents from the JSON:
Figure 4: Tabular Solution: Extracted Anti-Solvents
Similarly, the figure below is the extracted individual chemical drops from the JSON rows:
Figure 5: Tabular Solution: Extracted Drop Steps
Other queries could be written or individual tables can then be joined to achieve the necessary results.
Graph Database
We also attempted to replicate Kumar’s graph database
solution. He intended to use MongoDB to
implement a graph database from scratch, where each node is a document that contains a list of all its
predecessors and successors. Kumar notes that a limitation of this solution is that documents have a
16MB size limit, meaning some characterization output files can’t be stored within the database.
Kumar’s solution, importantly, gave us direction on how to store the data. His solution involved
creating a node type for each chemical and action/processing step.
Chemical
nodes would be paired
with an action (e.g. a
dissolve
step, indicating the
chemical was dissolved into a solution), and the
output solution would be stored as a different
Chemical
node. A recreation of this structure is as
follows, where gray nodes are
Chemical
nodes, and
blue nodes are
Action
nodes:
Figure 6: Example Single Solar Cell Worklist in Graph Format
Prior to this our group looked into different graph database providers - we settled on Neo4j, an
open-source, NoSQL native graph database management system. Neo4j implements the true graph all the
way down to the storage level instead of an abstraction, meaning that queries are in constant time (O(1)).
7
This fits our use case well - we agreed with Kumar that both teams would look into Neo4j.
In order to replicate Kumar’s solution in Neo4j, we first had to look into how to import the lab’s
data into Neo4j. Neo4j’s graph query language, Cypher, has a “LOAD CSV” command that allows us to
import the data in order to create the nodes and links from Kumar’s solution. The command can load data
into Neo4j from a file or a URL. We looked into Google Drive to host files, allowing us to load in files
with URLs and allowing backward compatibility with the lab’s existing data pipeline. Due to rate limits
with Google Drive, we then switched to hosting CSVs on Neo4j Docker directly. This allowed us to
create a script to run all the Cypher queries needed to both import the data and create the graph’s nodes
and links.
After determining what structure Neo4j requires files to use in order to read them properly, we
then modified and created data parser functions to convert the JSON worklists into CSVs. To create the
nodes and links for the graph representation of the data, we need to parse the JSON into 3 separate CSVs.
The first CSV contains the information on all of the chemicals used in the process. This includes things
like solutes, solvents, anti- solvents, and mixes of these chemicals. The second CSV contains information
on the Action steps of the process, such as
Dissolve,
Drop, or Spin
steps (among others). The
last CSV contains the information on how to link all of these action and chemical nodes. The first two
CSVs would be used to create nodes, and the latter would be used to create relationships. Below is an
example preview of these three files for a single solar cell sample:

Figure 9:
Links
CSV
All of these CSVs are connected via
step_ids
and
chemical_ids
which allows for the
necessary creation and linking of nodes in Neo4j. These graphs and their nodes have a
sample_id
and
batch_id
which helps ensure that each sample’s graph
is separate but also queryable via these
identifiers (e.g. in
Figures 7, 8, and 9
above, sample
0 comes from Batch 4, Experiment 1. Each batch
has around 40 samples).
Figure 7
contains some of
the chemicals, which are dissolved (
Figure 8
) in steps
1-6 (
Figure 9
). Not pictured are rows for the characterization
output nodes - nodes that store the actual
output of metric-recording characterization steps. Since Neo4j only supports primitive data types in node
properties, we transformed images into lists and tables into dictionaries, which can easily be turned back
into their original format using Python.
Once this was completed, moved on to creating the graphs for a batch of samples. In addition to
the ability to import data, the “LOAD CSV” command also allows for the creation and linking of nodes
via a query that is attached to a load command. An example of the Cypher code used to accomplish this is
shown below, where a CSV is loaded and used to create a
Chemical
node with respective properties:
LOADCSVWITHHEADERSFROM""https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=[fileid]""ASrowCREATE(c:Chemical {chemical_id:row['chemical_id'],batch_id:row['batch_id'],content:row['content'], molarity:row['molarity'],concentration:row['concentration'], volume:row['volume'],type:row['type'], sample_id:row['sample_id']})
Unfortunately, Cypher LOAD commands are unable to span multiple queries. This meant that for
a full graph, we would run 6 LOAD CSV queries in order to create and link all of the nodes. This is
inefficient for one sample, let alone for 40+ samples. Thankfully, Cypher allows for running scripts via
their Cypher shell terminal in order to run multiple queries at once. This required us to save the queries to
a .cypher file where each query/LOAD CSV command is semi-colon separated. To make use of this, we
created a script to scrape the file IDs for the CSVs in Google Drive folder into a spreadsheet. Then, we
wrote functions to generate the necessary queries to create a graph for each of the samples in the batch
and wrote them to a .cypher file, allowing us to automate the creation of these graphs.
We noticed that Neo4j Docker had quite a few limitations in terms of use cases and the ability of
the version of Neo4j, so we decided on trying to use Neo4j Desktop, as it gave us the possibility to
complete the objective of using python to use Neo4j. Once we were able to create the graph in Neo4j,
Desktop, we looked into using Python to run Neo4j, because the lab members were more familiar with
JupyterHub and Python. The solution that we found was a python package called py2neo, which allows
for querying the database in python and working with the data without requiring any data exports. The
database storage and access approach we came up with with the lab group was to use a host computer that
would act as a server where the people in the lab could access and use the database on JupyterHub.
Results
After graphing the nodes and links from our cleaned/transformed data, we are able to generate a
graph for each sample. The figure below shows the contents of one sample:Figure 10: Graph for Individual Sample
The blue
Chemical
nodes are connected to red
Action
nodes such as dissolve or drop. The
worklist for this particular cell involves hand-mixing several chemicals into “Mix1”, which is then fed
into a machine, where the rest of the steps take place. An antisolvent, MethylAcetate, is also fed into the
machine; both the “Mix1” solution and the antisolvent are then dropped together to form “Mix2”. The
new solution then undergoes a series of spin coater, hotplate, rest, and characterization (measurement)
steps. The sample is moved to “tray2” at the end, its final resting state. All characterization steps also
have another
Char_output
node, which stores the actual
output of the measurement (images, readings,
etc.). After running the all queries via our graph script, the database contains all the samples from one
batch:
Figure 11: Graph Database with all Batch1 Samples
The query time of the graph with more and more samples is displayed in Figure 12, where we
compared the following queries:
One Node Per SampleMATCH(n)WHERE(n.anneal_temperature = ‘110.0’)returnnMultiple Nodes Per SampleMATCH(n)WHERE(n.drop_height = 0.5)returnnUNIONALL MATCH(n)WHERE(n.anneal_temperature = ‘100.0’)returnn
Figure 12: Query Runtimes with Increasing Number of Samples
We also queried the entire graph in Neo4j and ran the equivalent in the RDB solution and found
that Neo4j was significantly faster than the RDB solution. The RDB solution takes O(n
6
) time because it
has to join 6 different tables per batch, leading to exponential growth on runtime for querying. Below is
the graph showing the runtimes on a growing number of samples for both Neo4j and the tabular database.
Figure 13: Query All Runtimes Neo4j vs. RDB Solution
Conclusion
Our group implemented a working lab-to-database pipeline by replicating some existing ideas. In
our discussions with Kumar and prior research, we found no similar solutions exist.
The usefulness of this solution is largely derived from Neo4j’s Cypher - queries are relatively
intuitive and simple to write, though we would need to communicate more with Fenning’s data team to
see if there are necessary actions that Cypher does not support.
Example Queries
The database can be queried and filtered for features of interest like sample_id, temperature
variables, or chemical content. Corresponding samples, nodes, or relationships, can be returned. For
example, the following query returns the graph of one sample, similar to
Figure 10
:
MATCH (n) WHERE n.sample_id=""sample0"" RETURN (n)
This query allows us to find nodes that have a specific property, like a rate of 80:
MATCH(n:Action)WHEREn.rate=80RETURN(n)
Figure 14: Node Query Output
And this query allows us to find all Br chemicals, as well as how they’re dissolved:
MATCH(n {content:'Br'})-[r]->(c)RETURN *
Figure 15: Node and Relationship Query Output
Limitations
The Methods section details how we have since solved two of the main limitations we had - the
Google Drive rate limit, and the storage of characterization outputs. Our current challenge is working out
hosting - Neo4j Desktop only runs locally as far as we are aware, and other versions of Neo4j with
managed databases are paid. We decided to put the database on their server computer so that the database
would be exposed and they would be able to use Jupyter Notebooks to access the database via the
aforementioned py2neo package.
Figure 16: The Time it Takes to Load Nodes
The figure above shows the time it takes for Neo4j Desktop to load in nodes from a csv by the
size of the node. The limitation on Neo4j Desktop for importing the nodes is the heap size, which can be
increased on the platform itself.
There are also further financial and technical limitations with Neo4j itself, which has different
tiers, pricing, memory limits, and other constraints we have yet to run into. Further research is needed; we
detail this below.
Future Work
Our group has also determined some courses of action we would ideally take from here - there are
several aspects of this solution that need to be fleshed out further:
An important step moving forward would be to meet with the lab team to talk about the best way
to output “workable” data moving forward, so that at the end of our data pipeline they can run any queries
or analyses they might need easily.
Last but not least, we would need to look further into Neo4j for the future. Assuming this is a
model that will be adopted and used for a while, we need to investigate pricing, size limits, and query
effectiveness/efficiency as the database grows in size. We also would like to become more familiar with
their Cypher query language to understand not only its limitations but also its potential for how complex
queries can be.

Abstract
Many applications use location data to provide services, but malicious users can disrupt these by
manipulating or faking their location. In an ef fort to combat and catch these users, our project
involves a system to authenticate user location data without having one central authority in
control of all the information. By leveraging the physical proximity necessary for devices to send
and receive data through Bluetooth Low Ener gy signals, our system is able to detect users lying
about their location without receiving any location information. Our portion of the project was
creating the server backend that communicates with devices to store information about flagged
users and process it for the purpose of adding malicious users to a blacklist.
Introduction
The project focuses on the legitimacy of mobile device locations, without compromising the
privacy of its user . Several popular mobile applications revolve around proximity to other
devices, such as games like Pokemon Go, dating apps like Tinder , or food apps like Grubhub.
However , it can be rather easy for people to spoof or alter their location data for the sake of
misleading these applications, which devalues their legitimacy and harms the user experience.
Additionally , users are conscious of the fact that they want to preserve their privacy at all times,
which requires applications to not use malicious software that could compromise an individual’ s
security . Location information is considered especially sensitive and people hate feeling like they
are being tracked. Due to these factors, our project aims to authenticate the location of mobile
devices without violating the privacy of its users. We look towards the DP3T  project as an
example of this implementation, where it was able to find a strong harmony between security and
location accuracy with contact tracing. Our project strives to follow the standards set by DP3T
and be able to authenticate the location of our users without compromising their privacy .
Since our project is modeled after and inspired by the methods used in DP3T’ s COVID exposure
system, it is important to thoroughly understand the work that went into their project. The goal of
DP3T  is to create a contact tracing method that will warn users when they were recently in
contact with an individual who recently tested positive for COVID in a secure and untraceable
way. Notably , the system will not keep data on positive cases, look into location hotspots for
cases, or share any data about users, even for research purposes.
For understanding the actual methods that went into DP3T , it makes sense to start with their
one-page comic summary .The one-page comic explains the core ideas of the DP3T  project. The team proposed 3 dif ferent
designs of a contract tracing system and outlined the pros and cons of each in the DP3T  white
paper . Each design utilizes decentralized proximity tracing, where smartphones generate
changing “ephemeral identifiers” (EphIDs), exchange them via Bluetooth Low Ener gy (BLE)
beacons, and communicate with a backend server to inform other devices when an exposure
event occurs.
The first design was deemed, “Low-cost decentralized proximity tracing,” and as its name
suggests, it focused on minimizing the data stored in servers through the use of pseudo-random
timed-based EphIDs. The issue with this design is that the seed that generates EphIDs would
need to be distributed to all devices when a user is exposed, which leaves an opening for
traceability . To close that privacy concern, the second design, “Unlinkable decentralized
proximity tracing,” hashes EphIDs of positive tested users and stores them in a Cuckoo filter at
the cost of more bandwidth and storage. This design also included an option for users to not
submit EphIDs for certain time periods as an additional layer of privacy . Finally , the third design,
“Hybrid decentralized proximity tracing,” was a middle ground that combined both of the other
designs. Taking from the first design, it functions by having seeds that generate EphIDs based on
time, but instead of only switching seeds when the user tests positive and sends it to the backend,
the seeds will instead switch every set period of time. Then only the seeds recorded during the
exposure window will be uploaded and reduce the risk of traceability . Unlike the second design,
these still keep IDs untraceable without requiring a cuckoo filter and related storage costs.
However , unlike the first design, more seeds will need to be stored in the backend which will
increase storage costs and bandwidth costs. Ultimately , this leads it to have more storage cost
than the first design and less privacy than the second design, but a good balance of both.
In addition to the DP3T  documentation, we additionally looked into other similar projects. This
is mainly as a supplementary understanding of the methods available and because our goal is to
expand this project to location tracing. Firstly , we looked into the options available for
communicating between devices. DP3T  chose to use BLE signals, which are a very common
form of communication between devices. Bluetooth Low Ener gy is very similar to standard
Bluetooth, but it takes less battery power to send and receive and also has a smaller data transfer
limit. This is great for sending EphIDs between devices because we want them to be constantly
communicated and they are small text files. The other important consideration for our project is
how BLE can be used to measure the distance between devices. Typically , developers compute
distance using a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) which gives a reading of how strong
a received signal is. By using this value in a conversion formula, it allows them to map RSSI to
distances and use that in their application. The issue is that RSSI can be inaccurate due to device
and location conditions. As explained in Corona: Positioning Adjacent Device with Asymmetric
Bluetooth Low Ener gy RSSI Distributions, signal strength can vary at dif ferent points on a
device.
This asymmetric distribution means that using RSSI to calculate distance will need to take device
orientations to be truly accurate. Additionally , this distribution will be dif ferent on dif ferent
devices due to component location and material dif ferences. As an alternative method, in Tracko
researchers made use of both BLE and the fact that each device emits sound waves encoded with
an identifier specific to that device to accurately pinpoint the relative location and distance
between two devices. They chose to utilize both methods in order to get a more accurate reading
of the distance between devices in their project. These sound waves are inaudible to human ears
and can avoid BLE-related issues, but they have their own issues with sound not being detected
in the other device or not reaching the other device's microphone.
We also looked deeper into projects that focused on using a similar system for location
consensus, which is our ultimate goal. The idea of global attestation of location in mobile
devices is to create a system that serves to confirm user location by corroborating their location
data with other devices in the area. In “Guaranteeing the Authenticity of Location Information”,
the researchers analyzed early methods of location authenticity and defined location
authentication in relation to entity authentication, which is the authenticity of the information
provided by other devices to verify the device in question. Additionally , that paper goes into
detail about various kinds of attacks that malicious users might perform against the system.
Aside from defining the types of attacks, they also provide a brief recommendation on ways to
avoid a specific attack. Since the main concern with location data is privacy in order to protect
users, we looked into a paper about a less theoretical security model.
Specific architecture has been created for the authentication of location as described in
“VeriPlace: A Privacy-A ware Location Proof Architecture”, which details how this system can
validate location data while also protecting privacy . The architecture intelligently detects
suspicious activity regarding the location of a mobile device, such as the user being in multiple
places at the same time. This location authentication is reliant on three main parties, where each
party knows either the user ’s location or identity . Separating this information ensures that one
malicious party cannot breach all of another user ’s information. The architecture uses two
different third parties, one for location authentication and one for user identification, which work
alongside a cheating detection authority to guarantee location accuracy and flag suspicious
activity . The third-party for user information contains encrypted data that compares the user ’s
location to the other third party which contains public information. For the system to be
confident in the location accuracy , the cheating detection authority compares the public location
information of a user ’s access point to previous ones. If two or more access points are too far
apart from one another within a short period, then the authority flags the location and marks it as
a sign of cheating. The paper describes how the architecture was constructed, along with how it
was implemented through the example of the popular application Yelp. It also explains what the
architecture considers malicious or an example of cheating, along with how each of the three
parties is trusted.
Lastly , “Global attestation of location in mobile devices”, discusses a system that dif fers from the
VeriPlace model by handling authentication on a global trust-based level rather than a local
cheating level. Devices that both record each other being in the same location at the same time
are said to be consistent and have their trustworthiness raised. On the other hand, devices that
make conflicting claims of having seen or not seen each other have their trustworthiness
lowered. Then these trustworthiness scores are converted into matrices and used to compute a
global trust value via the EigenT rust and PeerT rust models. When determining if a device truly is
where it claims, the system finds devices that claim to be near the device and devices that claim
to be in the area regardless of if they have seen the device in question. After sorting the available
devices by trustworthiness, the claim from the device with the highest score is taken as the
consensus report and used as the truth.
MethodsOur project sought to identify a method in which we could use Bluetooth signals from mobile
devices to verify user location without creating a privacy concern. To do so, we initially modeled
our solution of f of the base code structure of the D3PT  project. After several roadblocks in
getting their code to properly run and adapting it to our needs, we ended up making our own
backend from scratch. We now had the issue of trying to figure out what we would need to create
this whole service. For our server , we connected Heroku, Postgres, and Django to create a
website functioning as a backend database. This would allow us to begin storing some test data
which would lead the way to begin to store messages from phones and send replies back.
Once we had the tools established, we needed to figure out just how we would create an app that
uses location data while not compromising privacy . Our solution is to never send the location
data to a server in the first place. Location data will all be handled using Bluetooth between
phones and the only thing the phones will send to the server will just be the ID of the phones that
are in the same location as them physically , yet claim to be in a dif ferent location. More
specifically , users can fake their location by using a false GPS location, but their physical
location can’ t be faked. To accomplish this, we leveraged BLE signals, which can only be sent
between devices physically near each other . Phones near each other will communicate with each
other and identify which phones claim to be at a location dif ferent than their own. If a BLE
signal claims to be at a dif ferent location than a user , one of the two devices is lying about its
location. Phones will collect lists of IDs for devices they detect with conflicting locations and
then send that to the server . This allows the server to collect the IDs of users claiming to be at
different locations without ever sending location information to the server . While location
information is collected on the phones, it is not stored and is only used locally and any phone
close enough to receive a BLE signal would already know your location since it would have to
be within a few meters.
After the data is collected, it still needs to be processed on the server . We cannot just mark any
ID received as a fraudulent user and instead have to create a trust model to determine which
users are lying. For example, consider a situation where users A, B, and C are all at the same
location, yet C is lying about their location. Our server would receive claims from users A and B
that user C is lying, but we would also receive a claim from user C that both A and B are lying.
To resolve these claims, we need some form of a trust algorithm that can systematically
determine which users should be added to the blacklist. We opted to go with one of the most
simple trust algorithms: a majority vote. Based on the data it receives, our server adds users to a
blacklist if at least 50% of users claim they are lying within the time window . Despite its
simplicity , this algorithm can ef fectively identify lying users and operates under a fair outlook
that everyone is telling the truth. While more sophisticated methods could improve the logic,
address edge cases, or provide better defense against foreseeable attacks, our goal was to create a
functioning system with our limited knowledge of cybersecurity and backend design. With those
limitations in mind, this option provided the best balance of privacy and complexity .Results/Discussion
Our project successfully created a system that can identify users lying about their location data,
while also keeping their information private and decentralized. Utilizing the physical proximity
required for devices to send data through Bluetooth Low Ener gy allows us a way to track a user ’s
true location through other users instead of relying on sending the data to and from a system.
Additionally , we created a fair protocol that assumes all users are being truthful and only seeks to
identify lying users. This fair protocol uses majority voting and adds users who are flagged by a
majority of users to a blacklist that can then be used by any authentication service to check if a
user is likely faking their location. This operates under the idea that most users do not attempt to
fake their location and that those who do are repeat of fenders and will attempt to lie multiple
times.
All that has been discussed so far is about the current state of our project and there is room for
improvement and future growth. Our goal was to create a system meeting all of our requirements
and as many of our hopes as possible while taking into account our knowledge and skills. This
means that there are several limitations and possible solutions to address. Notably , our system
requires at least 3 devices at any given location in order for 2 truthful users to have a majority
over a lying user . Additionally , our current system has issues dealing with multiple groups of
users that create non-connected interaction sets. Both of these were fine under our goal of
creating this system for use over the UCSD campus, but would not hold up if implemented at a
large scale. Potential ways to address these problems would involve more knowledge of
cybersecurity or more sophisticated trust algorithms. The second issue of multiple user groups
could be addressed by sending data of all users seen by a device instead of just IDs of devices
sending conflicting location data, but that would encroach on user privacy . By utilizing data on
all devices a user came into contact with, one could create a web of social interaction or possibly
identify user location by mapping their paths with other users until it reaches a user with a
known location. Since user privacy was at the forefront of our project, we opted to not pursue
this route.
Lastly , concerning cybersecurity , our group members had little knowledge of attacks and
defenses against them. For testing purposes and to ensure a smooth connection between our
server side of the project and the app side, we left our server very open. If these ideas were to be
deployed into any actual environment we would suggest taking proper precautions to lock down
the server data, even though it only contains user IDs which are randomly generated hashes.
Following privacy techniques present in D3PT  could be even better , since they implemented a
system that changes IDs over time to avoid exposed data being able to be linked to any user .

Our capstone project deals with the topic of detecting
user location spoofing, or the
faking of one’ s current location. When using dif ferent applications, users may opt to spoof their
locations for a variety of privacy and security reasons, such as to protect their user data and from
being tracked. Location spoofing can also be used maliciously or for dishonest purposes.
Location spoofers may intend to gain unauthorized access to content that is normally restricted
based on location, conduct fraud or cyberattacks, and even gain advantages in video games that
offer rewards to players based on location.
Proxensus is an application that uses proximity detection to tag location spoofers through
a crowdsourcing voting method. Location spoofers who come within contact of honest users get
put on a ‘blacklist’  that servers handle. Proxensus adapts the framework of Decentralized
Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-3T), a proximity tracing system that determines
whether an individual has been exposed to COVID-19 without revealing location data or user
data. The creators of DP-3T  designed the system with the belief that slowing the spread of
SARS-CoV -2 doesn’ t just come down to wearing masks and isolating when positive. Rather ,
they recognized that understanding the general interactions between people and then notifying
them if they have been exposed to people with COVID-19 was integral in order to “break [the]
transmission chain”
1
.  Our application uses Bluetooth
Low Ener gy (BLE) technology for
proximity detection. A key value of Proxensus lies in its reliability in maintaining data privacy .
Our modified tracing system will ensure that the data sent to the central server will be minimal
(only location data and no other sensitive user data) and the authenticity of location information
will be guaranteed
2
(no fake/misrepresented data).
Our vision for Proxensus is to be able to
extend the algorithm to applications that rely on the integrity of user location data to improve
their functionality .
Introduction
Proxensus relies on gathering data related to the
legitimacy of mobile device locations
without compromising the privacy of the user . Our project was split into two teams: a server
team and an Android team. The Android team utilized DP-3T’ s framework for exchanging
anonymous unique identifiers between user devices. When users activate Proxensus, they will
have a unique identifier attached to them that does not reveal any further information about the
user. The server team handles all of the unique identifier data and utilizes crowdsourcing - or
“majority voting’  - to determine which of the unique identifiers are location spoofing.
Decentralized location census through location crowdsourcing refers to an approach to
conducting a census where data is collected from a dispersed network of users who are located in
various locations. This is typically done through the use of mobile devices or web-based
platforms that allow users to report information about their location and other relevantinformation. Using the data collected, we can generate an accurate picture of the population,
each location, and more importantly in our case, who, if anyone, is spoofing their location.
Literatur e Review
Our project is greatly influenced by the DP-3T  systems, therefore it makes sense to fully
comprehend and take a deep look at their proposed methodology and techniques. In general, the
DP-3T  application allows users to quarantine before any signs of symptoms. Users with the
applications on their smartphones are able to exchange temporary IDs that are generated every
epoch (user -setted) through proximity . Infected users notify the decentralized backend of their
status, and users are able to cross check with the stored IDs that they came into close proximity
to with the ‘flagged’  IDs shown from the database.
The DP-3T  project team has developed three dif ferent protocols that support our goal of
secure exposure detecting and tracing. The three methods, called low-cost decentralized
proximity tracing, unlinkable decentralized proximity tracing, and hybrid decentralized
proximity tracing, all share a common structure; they locally generate random ephemeral
(temporary) identifiers (EphIDs) and broadcast them through Bluetooth Low Ener gy (BLE)
beacons. However , these methods have tradeof fs regarding user privacy and computation cost,
which allows us as developers to weigh each factor against each other .
Low-cost decentralized proximity tracing of fers good privacy properties and low
computation cost/small bandwidth usage. A random initial seed is generated for the day and put
in a cryptographic hash function. For privacy purposes, devices change the EphId that they
broadcast often and the duration for which the smartphone sends this unique EphId is called an
epoch.The smartphone starts each day of f generating a list of seeds that it will broadcast for the
day. These seeds are then put in a pseudo-random function which creates the EphIds.
Unlinkable decentralized proximity tracing provides even better privacy properties at the
expense of computation cost and higher bandwidth. This method uses a bloom filter to store
hashed EphIDs of positive users which is disseminated to other users and this prevents any
linkage of EphIds to COVID-19 positive users as there’ s no list of seeds of positive users (unlike
low-cost decentralized proximity tracing). How EphIds are generated is that the smartphone
draws a random 32-byte seed which gets put through a hash function. The leftmost 128 bits are
then chosen as the EphId and are stored for however long health authorities recommend. A
bloom filter is generated by the backend every two hours for every seed is put through it to check
if it saw any EphIDs from COVID-19 positive users.
Hybrid decentralized proximity tracing uses ideas from both methods proposed above
and how it works is that it generates random seeds within a time frame and uses the seeds in the
same way as the low-cost design to create EphIds which are only uploaded to the server if they
could have possibly been at risk for COVID-19. In regards of privacy properties, this design
performs better than the low-cost model but worse than the unlinkable model. In terms of
computation cost, it’ s more ef ficient than the unlinkable model but takes more bandwidth thanthe low-cost model. In this design, EphIds are generated by a random 16-byte seed put through a
pseudo-random function. These EphIds are then broadcasted during an epoch of a fixed duration.
These epochs are grouped together in a time window .
Methods
For our project, we have decided for simplicity and certain constraints to implement a
rudimentary unique identifier generation system in which the seed is static, meaning that devices
will essentially only have a singular unique identifier . Our tracing system will then adopt a more
“majority rules” based crowdsourcing approach to determine whether a user has been faking
their location or not. This means that the tracing system will not only have devices share ID’ s
between them but also their current locations as an attempt to locate any location spoofers. This
is based on the assumption that the
hackers/spoofers
are in the minority of users
. The picture
below shows the algorithm we are implementing.
As the graphic illustrates above, smartphones will be sending ephemeral ID's to one
another . These devices will then send a list of IDs to the server of devices with a dif ferent
location from them. In this example, the phone with ID 3 will send a list of IDs [1,2,4] since they
are in UCSD instead of NYU while IDs 1,2 and 4 will send a list of IDs [3] since 3 is the only
one who is in a dif ferent location relative to them. With this information, the server could then
immediately tell who is the liar since their ID will appear numerous times on their end, hence
why it is a “majority” crowdsourcing algorithm.
As the Android team, we are handling the smartphone interaction/communication (via
BLE) side of the algorithm. For the foundation, we utilized an old DP-3T  prestandard codebase
as a framework. We heavily modified and built upon this codebase, only preserving and
changing the bluetooth framework of the existing DP-3T  which would have these 5 basic
functionalities:
1.
Unique ID generation
2.
Bluetooth service implementation for both client and server for message transmission
between devices
3.
Retrieval of location data, specifically zip code
4.
Posting IDs of devices with distinct locations as self
5.
Getting blacklist fr om server via GET  request to tell if user is spoofing their location or
not
To handle the first problem of generating a unique identifier , we decided to make it to be
constant and simply generate an 8 byte randomly generated number . This unique ID serves to not
only protect the user ’s information but also make it unique enough that there is no possible
overlap between the devices. This means that there would be no devices that have the same
identifier . We chose 8 bytes long because we had to be able to fit the IDs in the advertising
packets (explained in the next section), which were only to hold 32 bytes of data. This means 32
bytes of data can only be communicated between phones at a time. Considering the other types
of data that needed to be transmitted, such as the zip code (5 bytes)  and UUID (Universally
Unique Identifier; 16 bytes), we had only 1 1 bytes to use. We did not want to use all 1 1 bytes in
order to not go over the limit, so we decided on 8 bytes. For storage, we simply used
SharedPreferences to store them once the ID was generated, which happened only once.
For the second issue, we built upon DP-3T’ s codebase which had existing bluetooth
related code. In general, what we needed for the proximity tracing to work was to have a
working data advertiser and a data receiver . These are the primary mechanisms needed to make
communication between the phones possible.
Via BLE, a data advertiser would be the mechanism that sends data (or payload as it is
called by convention) to another smartphone device. In our case, the payload that would be sent
to a receiving device would be the unique ID and zip code. The advertiser would advertise to all
available bluetooth devices that have the same UUID. For this requirement, we simply used the
UUID which was utilized by the pre-standard codebase, which was 16 bytes or 128 bits long, a
standard for UUIDs. As mentioned before, the advertised payload with BLE is only 32 bytes in
size. In addition, the payload needed to be in byte array (byte[]) form. This meant, as we were
sending two types of data, we had to combine them into one byte array . Fortunately this was
made trivial with the use of the string methods, such .getBytes(), which allowed us to convertboth data and combine them. Finally , due to the always changing nature of zip codes, the
advertiser always needs to update its data to the current zip code location the user is in. To do
this, we made sure to destroy and re-instantiate the advertiser every few seconds. We decided 5
seconds was a good interval. This means that every 5 seconds the advertiser would cease its
service and then start again with a brand new zip code.
The other component of the BLE system is payload receiver/scanner . The scanner would
receive data from a device with the same UUID. With the bluetooth receiver/client, we had to
make sure that payload was the correct type. This was done by slicing the byte[] received from
the advertiser . The combined ID and zip code data was ordered, meaning the byte array could
simply be split and sliced. The first 5 elements of the byte array (5 bytes) corresponded to the zip
code while the 6th up to the rest was for the unique ID (8 bytes). Overall, the bluetooth portion
of the project was the most complicated task we had to complete
For the third task, which is retrieving zip code location, we achieved this by using
Android/Google’ s Geocode API, which essentially allowed us to retrieve the zip code by getting
the latitude and longitude values. The use of this API required our app to check location
permissions from the user . Furthermore, we had the setting for zip code retrieval to be frequent,
with the checks occurring every 5 seconds or so. Overall, getting the zip code was relatively
simple.
For the 4th and 5th tasks, Achieving them was pretty straightforward. Getting the list of
IDs with dif fering zip codes as the user was easily accomplished by comparing the zip code
strings and checking if they are the same or not. If they weren’ t, then that zip code would be
added to the list published to the server . As for the posting part, it was also quite easy . We used
the Java Net library in order to create the Post request mechanisms. We published JSON Object
to the server which followed the format {“from_user”:..., ”spotted_users”:..., “time”:...} created
by Server Team, where “from_user” is the ID of the device, “spotted_users” the list of IDs that
have a dif ferent zip code compared to the user and “time” as the timestamp. Posting to the server
had to be done on an hourly basis due to server limitations. The server , which was hosted by
Heroku, allowed only hourly updates of the blacklist. With this in mind, we had to make it so
that we were publishing data every 60 minutes.
Finally , making a GET  request to the server was also relatively simple and we had to only
check the output, which was the blacklist, and whether the ID of the user was there. If the ID of
the user was found in the blacklist, then they were blocked from participating in the tracking
process.
After completing these 5 goals, we had to thoroughly test the application. 3 smartphones
for the whole process to work. It required 3 because the majority-based algorithm required the
non-spoofer phones to be a majority . With two phones, having a majority was not possible. For
testing purposes, we hardcoded 1 of the 3 phones to have a dif ferent zip code. WeResults

Discussion of Results
Proxensus successfully creates unique identifiers per user - partially based on the
username and partially based on random number generation - upon activation of the application.
The application successfully uses Google API to grab a phone’ s projected location data. For
honest users, the application will pull the user ’s current zip code. For location spoofers, the
application will pull the fake location’ s zip code, as intended. One occasional annoyance
involves a slight inaccuracy with retrieving the correct zip codes. Two honest phones in very
close proximity to each other can display two dif ferent zip codes, but those two zip codes are
adjacent to each other . Fine tuning with pulling location data would be necessary to fix this.
The application’ s user interface includes a start tracking button which turns on the
phone’ s bluetooth low ener gy functionality . When phones are in proximity of each other and are
currently tracing, the application creates logs that display successful communication between the
phones. In other words, unique identifiers and corresponding zip codes are exchanged properly .
We have successfully established a link between the android phones and the server
database. Upon exchange of data between users, any data discrepancies result in the user sending
the data of the conflicting user to the database. Once the data is handled by the server side and a
blacklist of spoofers are generated, users are able to check if they are found on this blacklist. The
application has a button that cross checks with the database whether a user ’s unique identifier is
found on this blacklist and notifies that same user their status as an honest user or spoofer .
Because our application relies on crowdsourcing data and majority voting, one weakness
of the methods is that the majority vote is not necessarily the correct answer . For example, if
there are more collaborating spoofers with the same lying location data than honest users within
proximity of each other , the honest users would lose in the ‘majority vote’  on the server side and
be put on the blacklist. In the future, our application can fine tune parameters such as thresholds
necessary for the voting algorithm to be activated. There are many more improvements to be
made about the application, such as having IDs be generated based on a changing seed or time,
making it more secure and less vulnerable, similar to the literature that we have studied with
DP-3T  and other similar techniques.Refer ences

A B S T R A C T
Unsupervised domain adaptation is an important problem in machine learning. Machine learning models
trained on a certain dataset often are tested on datasets that are drawn from a different distribution. The
aim of our work is to find methods to provide the same performance of the machine learning model on a
test distribution as the train distribution. Optimal Transport is the new We propose using optimal transport
to achieve this and demonstrate results on a model used to asses poverty in Africa.
1. Introduction
Many machine learning models do not perform as well when
they are deployed for real world use as they do in training. This
disparity affects proper evaluation of the model and often leads
models thought to perform well and deployed for use in actu-
ality performs quite poorly. Many approaches have been used
to solve this issue including data augmentation, techniques on
preventing overfitting, e.t.c. . These methods work only under
the assumption that the training data for the model is represen-
tative of the data the model would be deployed on, i.e.drawn
from the same distribution. However in many areas, machine
learning models are tested on data that is a different distribution
of data than the one trained on. This issue comes under domain
adaptation. We specifically look at the case of unsupervised do-
main adaptation where the labels of the deployed distribution is
unknown.
1.1. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Given a train set Xs={xs
i}Ns
i=1where xs
i∈Rdand a set
of labels Ys={yi}Ns
i=1where yi∈C,Cis the set of all
labels, unsupervised domain adaption infers the labels of the
test set Yt={yi}Nt
i=1from Xt={xt

i=1. Unsupervised do-
main adaption also supposes that the probability distributions
Ps(xs, y)andP(xt, y)are not equal and are drawn from a
source domain Ωs∈Rdand target domain Ωt∈Rdrespec-
tively, Ωs̸= Ωt.
1.2. Optimal Transport for Unsupervised Domain
Adaptation
To use optimal transport for unsupervised domain adaptation,
we suppose there exists some non-linear transformation
T: Ωs→ΩtWe let P(y|xs) =P(y|T(xt))where Tis the most efficient
transportation with respect to a given cost. We will concretize
this using optimal transport.
Letr, cbe probability vectors in the simplex ΣNs×Nt={x∈

U(r, c)as the transport polytope between randcwhere
U(r, c) ={T∈RNs×Nt

Then, using Sinkhorn Transport algorithm as described in [1],
we can find Tby

j=1pijlog(pij)andpij=T(i, j)and⟨·,·⟩is the
Forbineus dot product. The regularization term is added to re-
duce the sparsity of the transport plan Tallowing for a smoother
transport overall.
2. Experiment
To test optimal transport in domain adaptation, we implement
Sinkhorn Transport for an unsupervised domain adaptation
problem. We want to test the following pipeline:
Train:
(Xs, Ys)→ML Model
Test:
(Xt)→T(Xt)→ML Model →Prediction Yt2AUTHOR
2.1. Dataset
We use the poverty map dataset from WILDS [2]. This data
provides satellite imagery of Africa with corresponding wealth
indices used to predict the wealth of the corresponding satellite
image. The images are divided by country, and by whether the
image is of a urban or rural area of the county.
Each satellite image has 8 channels which are blue, green, red,
short wave infrared 1, short wave infrared 2, temperature, near
infrared, and nightlights as shown below.
The distribution of wealth in the urban and rural areas are
very different per country. which made it important to train
models separately on the two distributions as otherwise simply
identifying the difference would result in a fairly good classifier
2.2. Problem Formulation
We let the source distribution be the satellite images from the
country Nigeria and the target distribution to be images of
Mali. We chose these two countries for the color shift betweenthem. Mali is far more desert and therefore more brown with
satellite imagery while Nigeria has far more grassland and
jungle resulting in more greener satellite imagery. Mali is
shown above and Nigeria is shown below.
We use convolutional neural network (CNN) as our machine
learning model that we train on satellite images of Nigeria and
deploy on images of Mali. The architecture is shown below.
Due to the change in distribution for urban and rural wealth,
we train two models – one on urban satellite images of Nigeria
and the other on rural. The model is trained for 400 epochs with
training accuracy shown below.
In this case, let Xsbe the set of satellite images of urban or rural
Nigeria, Ysbe the wealth labels where ys
i∈C={−1,0,1}.
The labels are classified by the lower third of the wealth,
middle third of wealth and upper third of wealth corresponding
to -1, 0 and 1 respectively.UNSUPERVISED DOMAIN ADAPTION
3
We then implement optimal transport by using satellite images
of Mali as Xt. As Sinkhorn Transport is still quite slow for train-
ing on large amounts of data, we train only on 500 points chosen
from urban (or rural) Nigeria and urban (or rural) Mali so that
Ns=Nt= 500 . We then find the transport matrix Tas de-
fined above and then transport each pixel in Xtby finding its
nearest neighbor in squared Euclidean distance and using the
corresponding transport plan of that pixel.
2.3. Results
We found in this case that Sinkhorn Transport did not work bet-
ter than simply using the model itself on images of Nigeria.
3. Conclusion
While optimal transport did not work for unsupervised do-
main adaptation in this case, we believe this is due to a lack of
data in our optimal transport leading to artifacts.

1 Abstract
Camera traps are commonly used by ecologists to monitor wildlife biodiversity
loss. However, the variation in illumination, camera angle, background, vegeta-
tion, color, and relative animal frequencies across different camera traps poses a
challenge for multi-class species classification using machine learning models. In
this paper, we propose a domain adaptation method using background removal
to address this challenge. Our approach involves subtracting the background
from the original image to highlight the animal features. We trained a convo-
lutional neural network on images with background removed, and our model
achieves a classification accuracy of 0.37 on images taken by existing camera
traps and 0.35 on images taken by new camera traps. These results represent
a significant improvement over the baseline model. Moreover, we preserved the
original color of the animal pixels by masking the background-removed image.
The average time taken for classifying one image using background removal is
0.0108 seconds, slightly longer than the baseline model. Our findings demon-
strate the potential of using background removal as a domain adaptation method
to improve the accuracy of wildlife biodiversity monitoring using camera traps.
2 Introduction
Camera Traps are placed in the wild to enable zoologists and environmental
scientists to gather valuable information about wild animals. Once triggered
by any moving object, these traps can automatically capture large quantities
of images. These images are crucial for monitoring animal species count, den-
sity, and behavior in the area. Analyzing the massive image data retrieved by
camera traps can be challenging. Therefore, it is beneficial to train a model to
recognize and classify animals in the image.
However, a widely recognized issue in deploying such models to images cap-
tured by camera traps in different countries, locations, angles and environments
1is domain adaptation. Changes in light conditions, seasons, and camera types
can significantly impact image quality and result in reduced model accuracy.
Moreover, training a new model can be time-consuming and costly, making it
difficult to keep up with the increases of camera traps and their ever-changing
surrounding environments.
To help address this challenge, we employ a preprocessing step to remove back-
ground noise from the images. The background removal ensures that the model
is only trained on more relevant information, thereby improving its accuracy
and adaptivity to new images captured in diverse environments. We then train
the model on the preprocessed images and experiment with its ability to clas-
sify and recognize animals in images from different sources and environments.
Comparing the model performance over different data subsets, we can assess
the effectiveness of our approach and determine whether it can be applied to
other camera trap settings.
3 Dataset
The dataset used in this study is the iWildCam dataset from WILDs collected
by Stanford, which includes over 200,000 images of 182 animal species captured
by camera traps deployed in more than 200 locations. The images have vari-
ous widths and heights but share the same color channels, and all images were
cropped to a size of 448 x 448 pixels for model input.
The images are labeled with one of 182 animal species and the domain, which
specifies the identity of the camera trap that captured the image. However, the
distribution of images across different domains is not even, with some domains
having as few as three images and others having thousands of images. Addi-
tionally, some images are labeled as having an animal present, but it may be
difficult to identify any animals in the image with the naked eye due to abnor-
mal illumination and exposure.
To ensure the models are able to generalize to new camera deployments, the
training and test sets comprise photos from disjoint sets of camera traps. All
images in the testing set are from domains (locations) that are unseen in the
training set. By training the model on images from a subset of camera traps
and evaluating the model on images from a different subset of camera traps, we
can test the model’s ability to generalize across domains with different environ-
mental conditions and animal populations.
24 Methods
For the method part, we preprocess the image data with two methods: back-
ground removal and normalization. Then we train a customized Convolutional
Neural Network model to classified the processed image.
4.1 Background Removal:
Background removal is a process that involves subtracting the background im-
age of a location from the original image, resulting in an image that highlights
the animal features in the photo. In the context of a domain adaptation prob-
lem, where models are trained on one set of camera trap photos and tested on
another set, background removal can be used as a method to reduce variation
between camera trap deployments. Since different camera traps can have vastly
different backgrounds, removing the background from images ensures that the
resulting images contain only animal features that are consistent across different
camera traps.
4.1.1 Background Extraction
To accomplish this, we used the mean and median pixel values of all images in a
location to obtain daytime and nighttime backgrounds. The median background
of each location is used as it was found to be visually sounder (less blurry as
shown in Figure.1) than the mean background.
Figure 1: Mean Background vs. Median Background (location 288)
4.1.2 Background Subtraction and Masking
To preserve the original color of animal pixels after background removal, we used
a masking method to filter out important pixels from the original image. For
each image, a threshold is determined based on the mean and standard deviation
of the norms of all the pixels in the background-removed image. Then, pixels in
3the original image whose RGB norm is above this threshold are identified and
masked, resulting in a filtered image that retains only the important pixel values.
This method ensures that the original color of the animal pixels is retained even
after the background is removed, improving the accuracy of classification models
trained on these filtered images. However, it is worth noting that this method
may not be effective if there is significant variation in animal coloration across
different camera trap deployments.

4.2 Normalization:
Normalization is a process in which the intensities of the pixels in an image are
adjusted to a common scale. This is achieved by transforming the pixel inten-
sities so that they have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. In our
situation, we decide to use Z-score normalization to the images that have been
apple with the removing background method. This process is useful in image
processing because it helps to reduce the variance between images and make
them more comparable to each other. We use Z-score normalization because
it is a useful process in image processing that can helps to improve the per-
formance of CNN model since it can improves image segmentation, facilitates
visualization of images, and reduces the size of images for storage and transmis-
sion.
4.3 Custom Convolutional Neural Network
We will use the CNN model for the wild animal classification task. We will
use the architecture similar to AlexNet with 5 learnable convolutional layers
and 3 fully connected layers (Krizhevsky et al. 2012), along with max pool-
ing and batch normalization layers between convolution layers. The nonlinear
activation function used is ReLU. The image input for alexnet is 227x227 and
the output layer is modified to fit the 100 animal classes of the dataset. The
model is trained with gradient descent and the loss function is cross entropy
loss. In the training process, we will tune the learning rate, batch size and data
preprocessing methods to achieve lower loss and better accuracy.
45 Results
Overall, the model’s performance on test data from unseen locations exhibits
improvement with the application of background removal. The accuracy in pre-
dicting both the original test set and the balanced test increases with the use of
this technique. However, it is worth noting that the ”Background Mask” method
necessitates a considerably longer preprocessing time and relatively higher pre-
diction time compared to other approaches.
The iWildcam dataset possess two test datasets: one is called ”id test” and com-
prises images captured from camera locations identical to those of the training
images; the other datasets ”test” includes images taken from camera locations
distinct from the ones where the training images were captured. Accuracy in
classifying the ”id test” images indicates the quality of the model. Comparing
the accuracy in predicting ”id test” and ”test” images show the generalizabil-
ity of the model. The difference is also an evaluation of the effectiveness of
the background removal and normalization technique in addressing the domain
adaptation problem. Table 1 displays the model’s performance on various sub-
sets of data. The table indicates that using background removal techniques
leads to higher accuracy in classifying animals in both the photos taken from
the same location as the training set and those from different locations.
Table 1: Compare accuracy for model generalizability
Model Baseline Model Model with Background Removal
”idtest” accuracy 27.2% 37.1%
”test” accuracy 23% 35.7%
balanced ”test” accuracy 6% 13%
In consideration of actual application. We focused on improving the time effi-
ciency of the background removal. In Table 2 below, we compared the average
time to preprocess an image and predict an image with and without background
removal. Even with background removal, the average time it takes to predict an
image is 0.0108 second without GPU. This is notably shorter than the typical
0.03 seconds it takes for a camera trap to capture a frame of an image.
We have observed that our model has better prediction accuracy and general-

ization performance on images captured during the daytime. As Table 3 shows,
the model improves the test accuracy in predicting daytime image by 11.7%
but only improves the test accuracy in predicitng nighttime image by 8.7%.
Daytime images exhibit distinct coloration with varying values in each RGB
channel per pixel. In contrast, images captured during low-light conditions or
nighttime appear grayscale, with similar values in each RGB channel per pixel.
In the masking process, we keep a pixel’s original value if any RGB channel has
a value that differs from the background by a certain threshold. Consequently,
our background removal algorithm performs more effectively on daytime images,
facilitating the identification of animal-containing regions.
Table 3: Compare accuracy of model prediction over daytime nighttime images
Model Baseline Model Model with Background Removal
”idtest” daytime 27.4% 39.3%
”idtest” nighttime 26.8% 34.4%
”test” daytime 23% 34.7%
”test” nighttime 23.2% 32.1%
6 Discussion
The use of background removal in domain adaptation for classification tasks in
camera trap photos is a promising method for improving model accuracy by re-
ducing the variation between camera trap deployments. Our study demonstrates
that background removal can be an effective method for capturing animal fea-
tures while minimizing the impact of background variation. However, there are
limitations to this method, such as the risk of losing important animal features
in images with small or similar-colored animals, and the need for sufficient data
to extract representative background images. In addition, the filtering process
used to preserve animal pixel coloration may not work well with highly variable
animal coloration across camera trap deployments. Future work could explore
alternative methods for addressing these limitations, such as incorporating ad-
ditional information on animal coloration or using alternative techniques for
identifying important pixels in filtered images.
Due to computational power limitations, we were only able to test a limited
number of combinations and record the performance of our animal type classi-
fication model. However, it would be highly beneficial to further test the model
6with background removal techniques, especially in other related tasks such as
animal counting in each image. We also want to test background removal with
more kinds of CNN model. Such tests would help to provide a more accurate
assessment of the model’s performance and suitability of background removal
technique for diverse scenarios.
Overall, the background removal process is a valuable tool in the domain adap-
tation toolkit for classification tasks in camera trap photos, and further research
could improve its effectiveness and potential applications.

Title: DOT A2 Pro Match Prediction
Abstract
In this project, we use machine learning techniques to predict the result of pro DOT A2
matches based on the heroes selected by each team after the pick and ban phase. We employed
various models, including neural networks, decision trees, and random forest, to analyze
historical data from DOT A2. After comparing the accuracy of each model, we found that the
random forest model gave the best prediction results with an accuracy of 51.4%. We also
investigated the counter relationship between heroes and found that considering this factor could
improve the accuracy of the model to 58.3%. Our model's prediction is consistent and robust,
and it can be used to help the DOT A2 community and players to have a more interactive game.
Keywords: DOT A2, Decision Tree, Random Forest
Intr oduction
The combination of heroes played in a DOT A2 match significantly influences the team's
success. Various companies have tried fitting a predictive model on the winning rate based on
hero selections; however , the robustness of their prediction is unknown and relationships
between heroes that would influence the winning result is still undiscovered. Therefore, in this
project, we attempt to predict pro match results based on the selected heroes after the pick and
ban phase using machine learning techniques and find relationships between certain heroes that
would af fect the result, and then test the robustness of our result at last. We analyze historical
DOT A2 data by using API and train our model based on the heroes' features and stats. The model
can help players make informed decisions during the pick and ban phase and improve their
chances of winning.
For the model, neural networks,
decision trees, random forest, andXGBoost were employed to predict the winning team and we found that the best-performing
model was  the random forest with an accuracy of 51.4%.
Methods
In order to predict the winning rate of each team based on their heroes selections, we
employed various types of machine learning models to analyze historical data from DOT A2 and
we want to identify the hero features that have the most influence on the outcome of a match. We
experimented with neural networks, which involves converting the data into tensors and creating
data loaders. Since the accuracy of predictions using neural networks is insuf ficient, our team
also attempted to build a predictive model using decision trees, random forest, and XGBboost.
We then evaluate and determine which model best suits our dataset for prediction by looking at
cross validation and accuracy of each model.
Once a basic predictive model has been established, our team will investigate whether the
relationship between heroes' and it can influence the accuracy of the model. This involves
exploring how the model captures the Anti-Mage VS Medusa counter relationship, a well-known
counter in the DOT A2 community , using the data available.
Lastly , our team evaluates the confidence and accuracy of the decision trees used in the
model. This will be accomplished by testing the tree’ s ability to identify the outcomes of matches
accurately while simultaneously determining its confidence level in the predictions made. This
approach enables us to assess the reliability and robustness of the model, ensuring that it can be
used to make accurate predictions about the outcome of matches in DOT A2.
Results
After employing dif ferent types of models (neural networks, decision trees, random
forest, XGBoost), we found that the model that uses the method of random forest gives us the
best prediction result, which is about 51.4% accuracy . Therefore, by using the random forest
model, we can predict the winning team 51.4% the time correctly after each team chooses their
heroes in those pro matches. At the same time, we also analyzed the potential winning strategies,
such as choosing the hero based on some counter relationship inside the game. We found out that
if the model learns that Anti-Mage counters Medusa, the accuracy of our best model’ s (Using
Random Forest) accuracy will be improved to 58.3%. Lastly , we examined the prediction of each
tree in the Random Forest model and found out that as each tree predicts a winning probability
that is further away from 50% chance of winning, the more accurate the prediction result is.
Therefore, when our algorithm is more confident of the winning result by giving a prediction that
is not close to a tie, the accuracy in predicting the winning team is higher . So, this shows our
model prediction is robust and could be used to help the DOT A2 community and the players.
Here is a confusion matrix for our random forest prediction:
Discussion
We acknowledge that our model's accuracy is not perfect, but it is a good start in
predicting the results of DOT A2 matches based on hero selections. We recognize that there are
many other relationships between heroes that our model has yet to learn. If we want our model to
have better prediction accuracy , we need to train it on more data and let it learn about more hero
counter relationships.
Additionally , it is important to note that the characteristics of the pro players and team
corporations are also essential in determining the outcome of a match. As such, we could try to
predict non-pro DOT A2 matches since the match results may be more dependent on hero
selections. Our model will help the DOT A2 community and players make more informed
decisions during the pick and ban phase, improving their chances of winning.
The strength of our model is that it currently gives us a prediction that is robust and we
have discovered some relationships between heroes selections that could influence the winning
rate, such as the example between Anti-Mage and Medusa, which are useful for players to
consider when selecting heroes.","This project aims to predict the outcome of pro DOT A2 matches based on hero selections using machine learning techniques. The random forest model achieved the best prediction results with an accuracy of 51.4%. Considering the counter relationship between heroes improved the accuracy to 58.3%. The model's predictions are consistent and robust, providing assistance to the DOT A2 community and players."
